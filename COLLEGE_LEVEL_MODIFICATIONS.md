# College-Level Readability Threshold Modifications

## Overview
The Feynman Grading System has been modified to target college/undergraduate-level readability instead of elementary school level. The system now aims to enhance explanations to reach a higher Flesch-Kincaid grade level rather than simplifying them.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Threshold Value Change
- **Before**: `self.flesch_threshold = 3.0` (targeting grade 3 level)
- **After**: `self.flesch_threshold = 14.0` (targeting college/undergraduate level)

### 2. Threshold Logic Inversion
- **Before**: `meets_threshold = flesch_score <= self.flesch_threshold` (lower is better)
- **After**: `meets_threshold = flesch_score >= self.flesch_threshold` (higher is better)

### 3. Method Renaming and Purpose Change
- **Before**: `simplify_explanation()` - Made explanations simpler for children
- **After**: `enhance_explanation()` - Makes explanations more complex for college students

### 4. Prompt Modifications
The enhancement prompts now instruct the LLM to:
- Make explanations "more sophisticated and academic"
- Target "college/undergraduate students"
- Increase complexity to "advanced college level"

### 5. Updated Comments and Output Messages
- Changed references from "simplification" to "enhancement"
- Updated target descriptions from "young children" to "college level"
- Modified progress messages to reflect the new approach

## Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Reference

| Grade Level | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 0-5 | Elementary school |
| 6-8 | Middle school |
| 9-12 | High school |
| 13-16 | College/Undergraduate |
| 17+ | Graduate school |

The new threshold of 14.0 targets the middle of the college/undergraduate range.

## Testing Results

The test script confirms that:
- Simple text (grade 3.67) does NOT meet the threshold
- Moderately complex text (grade 14.14) DOES meet the threshold
- Highly complex academic text (grade 28.14) exceeds the threshold

## Impact on System Behavior

1. **Iteration Direction**: The system now iteratively increases complexity instead of decreasing it
2. **Success Criteria**: Explanations must reach college-level complexity to be considered successful
3. **Grading Context**: The enhanced explanations provide more sophisticated context for essay grading
4. **Target Audience**: The system now serves college-level educational needs rather than elementary education

## Files Modified

- `feynman_grading_system.py` - Main system implementation
- `test_college_threshold.py` - Test script to verify changes
- `COLLEGE_LEVEL_MODIFICATIONS.md` - This documentation

## Usage

The system can now be run with the same interface, but will produce college-level enhanced explanations instead of simplified ones:

```python
system = FeynmanGradingSystem(max_iterations=5)
# The system will now target college-level readability
```
