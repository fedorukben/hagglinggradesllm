409	University:Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I suggest that students should attend classes with following 3 reasons. 

First, You can learn more detailed and advanced quality. If you don’t come to the class, you’ll miss professor’s additional but intenisve information and useful knowledges which is not written in the textbook or other lecture materials. 

 Second, You can have immediately question to professor during the class about the things you have trouble in understanding. Some people says there are other ways to interact to professor like e-mail even if you are not attend the class, But since you should question to professor by e-mail or other materials and this would take much time. And for some cases, If there exist some points you can’t understand then you can’t proceed to next topic and this would be waste of time

 Finally, You can interact with other students. You can share question or opinions of other students since class would be interactive. Question of classmates is especailly useful because they have similar understanding level about the same topic so you would have more possibility to wonder about the same thing. This would help your study. 

 In summary, attending class is much better since you can interact with professor and other students and also you can take better lecture."	3.5	3.0	3.0	9.5
1375	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"If I can change one important thing in my country, I change  the recognition of success . We grow up , hearing that ""you should study very hard!"".  
It results  in a thought or recognition,  studying and making much money is definition  of success. However, I do not say studying and being  a millionaire or billionaire  is not a gauge of success. There is  three reasons about it. 
First of all , almost every people  have ther  own goals which is filled with things they like and love.  However, if their goals is not matched with other's expectation, for example, to enter the best university, they become weak and give up easily ther dreams.
Best method to engage in goals they dream is to change the recognition about criterion of success.
In addition, thoughts about the success in Korea result in more complex emotional problems. People think studying is the best method to achieve goals. These thouhgts cause students to recognize their friends as competitors.
Consequently, it makes them feel complex and emotional sickness. what we should give them is not emotional tiredness but motive to achieve their goals.
Finally, changes of recognition about success can make our nation develop compared with other countries. In the world, develpment of nation can result in high nation competitiveness because many people do their best only what they want.
Thus, Korea becomes wholy developed nation in many aspect of art, literature, study and so on.
In other words, we make efforts to change the recognition of success to make our Korea be filled with people who do what they want, feel happy about around people and are skilled with their job."	4.0	3.0	3.0	10.0
1902	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are many countries which I want to visit. But these days, visiting foreign countries is prohibited because of covid-19, so I couldn't visit a foreign country. If I have the opportunity to visit a foreign contry, I really want to visit U.S.A. There are several reason I want to visit there.
First, I have visited some foreign countries such as France, England, Italy, Germany, China, Taiwan, but I have never visited U.S.A. I want to go and see some famous landmarks in U.S.A. Two weeks are long time to travel a foreign country. There are many states in U.S.A and it is large to travel, so it is appropriate to visit for two weeks. And Temperature is one of the important condition to visit a foreign country. U.S.A's weather is similar with Korea, that is, U.S.A is not very hot or very cold so U.S.A is good to travel.
Second, I want to communicate with foreign people in English. I am not good at English speaking rather than reading or writing, listening. So I think visiting U.S.A can be great opportunity to develop my English speaking skills. Not only practicing English myself, but also talking with foreign people who use English would be very helpful to me. After I graduate the university, I want to study in a foreign country to get master or doctor degree. So increasing English speaking skills is necessary to me. 
Finally, I want to visit my friend's house. I have a friend who has lived in Los Angeles. He always said He will invite to his house when I visit U.S.A to me. So I promised that I will visit U.S.A later. If I visit U.S.A, I can meet my friend and I can sleep at my friend's house, then I can save some money. Also he can guide me to travel U.S.A because he knows U.S.A well.
In conclusion, I would like to visit U.S.A because I have never been to U.S.A and I want to communicate in English and I want to visit my friend's house. If the covid-19 disappears and I have the opportunity to visit other countries, I really want to go U.S.A. I hope I can visit U.S.A until next year."	4.0	4.0	3.0	11.0

" In Korea, Man need to go army 2 years by military duty. Recently, army is getting more comfortable because of advanced humanity and broadcasting real life and issues in military. Soldier allows their cell phone to communicate outside of base also they get more wage and short military period than before. 
 Even though military is more comfortable than before, still many person try to avoid going military because they think 2 years in military can make career distortion, lack of freedom and other several reasons. Some people think military is best place to clearing their mind and think about their future. But, this opinion doesn't considering why rest amount of time is given to soldier. Military is not a good place to do self-development. Many military base is in the country side even they located top of the mountain. This penalty can make lack of supplying resource from outside. Also, many base is lack of instrument because base builds too long time ago. So that, soldier has forcely their time that can't communicate outside well and situated lack of resource anvironment when end of day work.

1431	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"    What do you think the necessary points which people can be lived? Generally, people say the clothes to wear, the places to live, and the foods to eat. Besides three things, people need various things to live as human. In my university, KAIST, most of things consist well enough to satisfy people, but I think there are some deficient things in eating. Therefore, I would introduce why KAIST could change the policies related to eating.

     The first problem is the number of kinds of the food. As you look around KAIST, there are few restaurants like Kaimaru, Lotteria, Subway. Although Kaimaru has four types of restaurants, their menu are limited and the students who lived for a year feel that the food is always repeated.

     The second problem is the open time of restaurants. KAIST students used to late at lunch or dinner by their study or research. Then most of restaurants in KAIST closed in that time and the students should eat their meal in outdoors.

     In conclusion, the eating in KAIST has the problems in types of food and time. I think it could be solved by increasing the number of restaurants, and I hope these problem solve as soon as possible."	3.5	3.5	4.0	11.0
953	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Specialize in One Subject is Mandatory
     Recently, many discussions regarding how to educate students have been made. One topic in the discussion is about whether students have to specialize in one subject or take classes in various subjects. In my opinion, specializing in one subject is much better than taking classes in many subjects for several reasons.
     First, modern society requires specialists in one field rather than transdisciplinary talents. Nowadays problem that we have to solve is really complicated and is a really large one. This implies that finding someone who can take care of all parts of the problem is impossible. Instead of one convergence talent, lots of experts from various areas cooperate to handle one big problem by solving small, but complex components of the problem. Therefore, specializing in one area is important to handle modern complicated problems.
     Next, training experts is more efficient. Knowledge of modern society is too deep and wide to cover all areas. About 2 or 3 centuries ago, scholars of that era studied about many areas; mathematics, physics, and chemistry and so on; however, as humans accumulate their knowledge, the research area has become deeper and more complex than in past days. This fact makes educating enough level of convergence talent much harder. However, training experts takes much lower costs and is easier than training convergence talents. To sum up, specializing in one subjects can produce more competitive researchers.
     Some argue that training leaders who can understand and integrate ideas from various area is more important in modern era; however, such talented leaders can be easily replaced by cooperation of experts. Nowadays, the leader who can point the way to proceed and manage every component of work is vanishing. Instead, cooperation of specialists takes its place. Modern problems can be handled by cooperation of many specialists. Therefore, it is more beneficial to train specialists than transdisciplinary leaders.
     In conclusion, educating experts in one field is more efficient, and fits to current trend. In modern era, training convergence talents is not competitive anymore. Therefore, we should encourage students to specialize in one subject than taking multiple kinds of subjects."	4.0	4.0	4.5	12.5
2247	If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" What is advantage of fast food restaurant? Why do you use fast food restuarant and eat fast food? I think it's taste, long open time and short time to receive food makes people to use fast food restuarant. But Lotteria in our university doesn't work well at this points, so I want to change Lotteria to other fast-tood restaurant for three reasons. 
 First, Lotteria doesn't have representative menu to attract people. In Lotteria, there is a 'Mozzallela in the Burger', but this bugger seems weaker than other fast-food restuarant's representative burger. For example, there are 'Bulgogi burger' in Macdonalds, and 'Ssai burger' in Mom'stouch, and there are main burger with lot of popular in BurgerKing. Except Lotteria, there are mania of each fast food restaurants with common popular, and I could tell Lotteria is not popular to other peoples than other fast food restaurants like Macdonalds, Momstouch, and Burgerking.
 Second, there are uncommon break time in Lotteria at KAIST. Students can't order hamburger until 6pm. Students only can order deserts like icecream or coffee. Lotteria in KAIST said there are lack of workers, so unevitably they recieve hamburger order after 6pm. I could understand about lack of workers, but wait to eat Lotteria until 6pm is quit late to eat dinner for some students.  In my opinion, fast food restaurant's biggest advantage is can order various time without break and long opening time. So I suggest use more workers to receive order more early than 6pm or having another fast food restaurant in KAIST instead of Lotteria.
 Last, student need to wait long time to order their hamburger and receive them. Unlike their name ""fast food"", students need to wait very long time to have their meal in Lotteria in KAIST. Usually student have to wait 30-40 minutes to order their meal at lunch or dinner time, and more time is needed to receive what they ordered. Because of this problem, I try to go little bit earlier than dinner time, but I couldn't order my meal because of Lotteria's uncommon break time. Usually, people go to fast food reastaurant to have their meal compactly, but we can't eat our meal fastly at Lotteria in KAIST.
 For these reasons, there are lot of complains about Lotteria. So I suggest change Lotteria to another fast food restaurant like Macdonalds, Mom'stouch, or Burgerking. If if is not sufficient, I rather suggest having more workers at lunch and dinner time to run Lotteria fastly. If my suggestion adopted, more students will go Lotteria and it's selling will increased, or more students can have their meal easily. "	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
1751	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"If I could change one thing, I will change the method of listening lecture in my university. I think lots of classes are focused on only delivering knowledges. our most of classes are composed of only listening lectures.It has a lot of great adventures. For example, We can know a lot of knowledge and absorb the teacher's ideas. But i think that it will be dangerous to students in these days. There are three reasons in my opinion. 
First of all, Only listening lectures let stop thinking on their way.  I believe that we have to discuss and share ideas in class time. I want to say that making own ideas and thinking is more important than good scores in tests. So it is very important to express their ideas and share thinking in lectures.
Second, the method of only listening lecture is dangerous to fix their mindset.  It makes to focus on only taking tests in their lecture. Students have to develop own their thinking and mind. Flexible mindset can change the world better. However fixed knowledge can't change anything. In these reasons, We have to develop to express ideas with people. Only few listening lecture is necessary to students. But, the most of lectures have to change the method and processes. 
Third, the only listening class of lecture is old process in old university. Nowadays, there are new knowledge and ideas. In these days, Making new knowledge is very necessary point. So we need to find the new insight while sharing ideas with professors and students. 
Finally, Although I definitely agree to absorb the knowledge while listening lecture. But it is too dangerous to focus listening. In these reasons, I want to change the process of listening in class time. "	3.5	4.0	2.5	10.0

351	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"The impact of the development of computers is one of the most controversial issues facing the world today. Some people claim that computers have made life complex and stressful. On the other hand, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient, because of information accessible through the internet, globalization.
 First of all, Some argue that countless information including private information is opened on the internet even though people want. On the other hand, information and knowledge in the various areas are accessible via the internet. In the past, information was exchanged by letters or face to face meeting. Furthermore, a lot of knowledge was learned from books. However, since the internet has developed in the world, people can easily ask about the recent situation of friends and families. Also, by sharing knowledge in the media, a lot of students can get opportunities for learning. Even though inevitable information can be opened, convenient accessibility of information via the internet give people more interactive relations and educational opportunities. 
 Next, computers have made the world globalized. Through the various interactions with other countries, people can get an interest in other countries' cultures. For example, BTS from South Korea could be famous all over the world since their music videos and performance videos are spread fast through SNS such as Twitter and YouTube. The development of computers made people interact and share their cultures with each other conveniently. As the result, globalization has been proceeding all over the world. 
 In conclusion, the development of computers brings positive effects such as the accessibility of information and globalization. As some say that computers have made life complex, if people struggle to use computers positive, we can solve many problems with computers ."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0
1808	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	" Which country do you think is the best country to study. Korea is also good option. However, there are some people that studying in foriegn countries is much better option. Students who study abroad because it can be the special experience and the good chance to learn.
 First, studying abroad is special experience. Usual people have visited foreign countries just for travelling, and also there are people who have not visited a foreign country yet. Living in the another country is an unusual and special experience for itself. Not just for living culture, the way to study is different in foriegn countries. Studying in different ways is also helpufl experience.
 Second, studying abroad can be better chance to learn than studying in their home country. Foreign people have different cultural background and different perspective. If we meet them and interact with them,  we will have broader perspective. Another good point is learn English even fast. We use English when we should communicate with foreign people. It is clear that the longer time we use English, the easier learning English is.
 In short, studying abroad can provide special experience and good environment to learn new things. You should go abroad and study, live there if you like new challenge."	3.0	3.5	3.0	9.5
669	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Most of people want to success in life. Success is the most important thing to achieve, and it is not easy to most of people. Success in every project in our life leads to success in life. Some people may say that success comes from chances, and luck is the most important factor in success. However, I think success is the result of careful and sophisticated planning.
 First, success without careful planning is easy to fail later. Success with luck is that all factor of project are good state, and they are not made of you. Therefore, if one factor in project becomes wrong, it is not easy to fix the factor and make all factors good again. Then, several factors becomes wrong, and you don't know how to fix them, and the project would fail. However, if we know about all plans in the project, we can know what goes wrong immediately, and we can fix what goes wrong as soon as possible. Some people might say that success with careful plannig also cannot cover all factors in the project. However, it is much better that some main factors can be fixed if they go wrong than that we do not know what to repair.
 Second, people can repeat success with careful planning in the simillar situation. We will encounter simillar situations if we do project in the same subject. The factors that influence the simillar situation are same in the previous situation we success. As we experience the simillar situations again and again, we can accumulate the ways which are helpful to success in the project. Therefore, we can success easily in the next project and it leads to success in life.
 Lastly, we can share our work with our colleagues with careful planning. We cannot do the big project alone, so we need to collaborate with other people. However, if we do not know overall plans in the project, we cannot share our thoughts or plans with other people. It makes the success of the project slower, or it can be result in failure in the project. Sharing the same plans is important to collaborate in the same project. We can get help by other people easily when we explain where we need help.
 In conclusion, success with good plans can fix what goes wrong, repeat the success in similar situations, and share our work with our teammates. Although there is no perpect plan to success, we need to do our best to plan carefully and make good plan. Good plan and your efforts lead to success in your life."	3.5	3.0	3.0	9.5
441	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Education programs in these days usually encourage people to discuss their thinking with others. Some professors in KAIST even tell students to study as a group. However, there are still lots of debate about studying with a group is efficient or not. I personally think that studying together eventually enhance performance in perspective of getting knowledge.

Some might said that studying with a group will cause significant decrease of patience. However, there are lots of researches that studying with friends with same goal make the group to accomplish faster than studying alone. It may decrease patience sometimes, but group with aligned purpose will succeed at the end. Also, there are some opposing argument that studying alone is efficient when time is limited. However, studying is not just activity to prepare for single test. We should study forever to develop myself and become better person. Therefore, thinking study as time-attak task is not right. In addition to these couterarguments to the claim that  studying alone is better, there are several reasons why studying as a group is better.

First reason is that studying as a group will eventually make that group to acoomplish goal very concisely. If we study together, we usually have time to test that my knowledge is right. By doing this, we can figure out that we are doing right now. As I said above, study is not time-attack task. We should make castle of knowledge as concrete as possible. Studying with group will help me to get exact knowledge. 

Second reason is that studying as a group will encourage group to overcome some difficult task. If we study some very hard fields, there might be some point that nobody knows how to solve some problem. Then thinking as a group will make me to overcome this. There is word “group intelligence”. This means thinking as a group has more diversity and even more concreteness than thinking as individual. In perspective of getting knowledge, group study will help to find unsolved problem. Even you cannot find solution, experience with different point of view will make your life more flexible than before. 

As I wrote, despite of opposing arugments that studying alone is better, there are quite lots of good reasons that we should study as a group. Human is social animal. We can become top predator of Earth, since we are the animals that can communicate the most complex than others. If we study as a group, we will not only learn about that field concisely, but also learn how to solve hard problem with communication. If we go out to society and work, these will me the most valuable experience. I hope every students in KAIST know this things and help each other to become leader of world."	4.5	4.5	4.0	13.0
1284	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" If I could change one important thing about my country, I would change the language that lots of country use, such as english.

 First, we don't have to learn foreign language. In my country, most of student spend a lot of time to study english. If we use common language, we can save that time and do other things. Also the stress from the study would be decreased. It would be really helpful to student.

 Second, we can communicate easily with foreign people. The easier communication would promote the collaboration with other country. And the collaboration would improve the study, company, literature, art, etc. We can enjoy the better quility of many things.

 Finally, we can go traveling more comfortablely. There are lots of uncomfortable things because of the difference of the language. If we can't speak foreign language, we need the translation machine or guide. However, if the languages that used in other country and my country are same, we wouldn't need them.

 As these reason, I would change the language if I could change one important thing about my country."	3.5	4.0	3.5	11.0

483	University: Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Free Education
          Many students want to enter better college to take better education. Many students in good universities are satisfied because their college have high-quality education, but students in low universities are dissatisfied because the quality of their classes is not good. Although some people think that higher education should be given only to good students, making education available to all students is better.
          First of all, education inequality will decrease. Some students have a hard time to study because of their family or money. If the change of education is given only good students, these poor students will not get knowledge and education inequality will increase. However, if higher education become available for every students, student can learn regardless of their situation.
          In addition to knowledge, better education make world better. Since the quality of lecture is depend on professor, academic performance can be effected by the quality of lecture. If students can study with well-made lecture, their performance will increase; as a result, a society will be improved.
          Some argue that education should be available only to good students because they study hard to enter the university. However, the essence of university is to explore the truth. Therefore, if someone want to explore the truth, university should welcome them. 
          To sum up, the change of education should be given to all students. Since the knowledge is not belong to someone, every students should be guaranteed the right to learn. Also, if education is given to every students, inequality will decrease and the world become better. Therefore, university should provide education for all students."	4.0	4.0	3.5	11.5

A famous society said that humanity is so society animal so we can't live alone. All of people want to make great friends. I'm also belonging here. Then, What is the qualities of a good friend. Now, let me introduce my opinion about this topic. 

 I think that there're three things to be a good frind. First, kindness is important quality of a good friend. Let's think about one situation. One day, you're in school at rainy day. However, you don't bring an umbrella. This is so sad and common situation, isn't it? You tries to go home so tell your situation to your friend. If your freind is not kind enough to use his(her) umbrella with you, he ignore you and just go alone. But if your friend is kind enough, you can go home without wet. This is trivial but common example about kind friend. However, if your friend isn't kind enough to use his umbrella, you can't go home without wet. Furthermore, you may have a cold and can't go school the next day. That situation is trivial thing but it may go bad. Thus, kindness is important and why kindness can be a quality of a good friend.

 Second, fun friend is important to play anything. All people may have an experience to play with their friends. If there aren't fun friend, the mood among the friends and you may go to cold. Then, you think that if there're fun friend, we can play more and more fun. and if you have some bad thing, the fun friend can make you happy. Ofcourse, It can't be a good friend who is fun but do not think your mind and behave just he(her) want. This is not healthy relationship and in the future, you and your fun friend's relationship may go bad in high percentage. 

  Finally, sensitive friend is nessesary through your life. If you have bad thing like fighting with you parents, this friend can be a good counseller. With them you can be more mature and can learn their considerable things through their behavior. This is good friend also. 

 These are three qualities of a good friend that I think. Every people want to make good and best friend. However, most of them don't see back theirselves. I want to say some sentence and end of this writing. To make good friends which I said, you should be a good friend first. Thank you for reading my opinion and I'll end this writing here.

Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.             	"I believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. There are several reasons that support my view. First, I think that there is no proper way to select ""good"" students. Some students, who have enough money, are already available with great education while others don't. Therefore, evaluating students to give a higher education itself would be unfair. Students who already can get high-quality education will easily pass the exam for evaluation. Secondly, higher education have to be provided to students who WANT to study more, not to students who are GOOD at studying. Everyone has the right to learn what they want to learn. It makes a much larger possible choices for people to select a right job. That diversity helps to form a creative and happy society. Some people may say that giving an lecture or providing various resources requires too much money to be available to all students. They insist that it is simply not effective. However, I think that the cost can be reduced by recording lecture video and provide it or just encourage students collaborate on studying. I also think that the social benefits that comes after good education are much greater than the cost. Everyone has the right to learn to make their lives better. Society have to support members to study and select a job that they really want. Therefore, it is essential that higher education can be accessible to all people."	4.0	3.5	3.5	11.0

Today, I'm going to talk about hobbies for college students, why am I recommend to have a hobby and what  hobby ia a good for you.
     To have your own hobby has many adventages. I think many high school students of Korean have no hobbies because of study. So I understand you who is freshman in Korean college have no hobbies. but, I think you experience a situation that you study all day. At that time, you may be tired, stressful, and hate study. So you should have some hobbies to relax and reduce stresses. Also, hobbies may make your another dreams or new friends through hobbies activity. For these reasons I think there are no reasons not to have hobbies.
     Then what hobbies is a good choice for college students. The best Choice is having club about you like. Because, if you have club, you can make new friends and enjoy activities steadily with your friends. Among lots of clubs, sports clubs is the best best choice. If you have sports club, there are so many adventsges including before I talked. You can make your hobbies to play sports, exercise makes you more healthy, and you can enjoy and learn sports that you like . So, To enter sports club means that you have hobbies and you can be more healthy. I recommend to have sports club.
     If you have another interseting like music, dancing orsomething , clubs about it is also a good choice.  But although you don't have thought about sports, because of reasons I talked How about apply sports club?"	1.5	2.0	1.0	4.5

It is so variable even some people came from other country. each country has different things in culture and geological. So, many people has different view and has opinion about important one things what they want country to change So, I want to introduce just one thing  what I want country to change in following reasons. It is a bully in Korean students. My country, South korea should not have bully in student society. 

 First, For almost students, school is their biggest society. Students in Korea have to go school in everyday except weekend. For instance, if one student jiho bully other student juno, juno's society will destroy by physical and language violence of jiho. It is not fair to juno and other students.

 Second, Being Bullied cause PTSD to one or more students. If one person got bullied in neiborhood, a chance of that person to grow to mental-healty adult will decrease because he will have negative behavor for everything.

 Thesedays, many witnesses of bully disclose what happend in school about the enterteinment world.It will be goodflow for our society. So, If i could change one important thing about my coutry Korea, what I want is  disappearing of bully."	3.0	2.5	2.5	8.0
189	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are two types of students about their study : students who study alone and who study with a group of students. It depends on each one's preference, but i think studying alone is better in terms of concentration, efficiency, and internalization.

           First of all, you can concentrate better in studying alone than group studying. While studying alone, you can care only contents and your comprehensions.

But in a group studying, interacting with other students is not avoidable, so you are supposed to care about things that are not related your learning : chatting with others, checking other's comprehension about contents. This disturbs you to concentrate and leads to low learning efficiency than studying alone.

          Secondly, you have to notice an importance of studying alone, not together. To master the contents or subjects, you firstly have to hear a basic explanation about them, secondly, have a time to understand and practice on your own.  The first step can be carried in many ways : asking a teacher, googling. But the second step is an internalizing step for you, so it can be carried only by studying alone that contains your own thoughts, comprehension. The group studying can not do this. 

It is just a repeat of the first step with other students.

         So far, I have talked about the reasons I insist studying alone is a better way compared to the group studying. Studying alone can bring you a better grade and deeper comprehension with better concentration and internalization that the group studying does not have."	3.0	3.0	3.5	9.5
1702	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" Many people have smartphone these day. Because of that, we can talk to each other whenever and wherever we are. Before, we didn't talk to each other because there wasn't a way to do. I think that smartphones are helping communication for three reasons.
 First, we can communicate wherever and whenever it is. Smartphone made it able to communicate even though it is far apart. If we can access to the internet the location doesn't matter. Also, we can talk to each other even in the early morning and in the midnight.
 Second, it is easier to make some new friends. Before, we needed to meet each other to get closer. Now, we can talk online and make new friends. For example, I made new friends few weeks before going to high school by online.
 Lastly, it is able to see the conversation that had before. Because it is hard to remember everything we talked about, sometimes I forget about what we talked before.
  In conclusion, smartphones are making communication easier than before. It is able to communicate wherever and whenever it is. Also, it is easier to make new friends. Because of smartphone, it is able to see the previous conversations. For the three reasons above, I think that smartphone helped communication among friends and family. "	4.0	3.5	3.5	11.0
1085	Lifetstyle: Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"Benefits of Getting Up Early
     Throughout history, work-week has been shortened from 7 days to 5 days. Even in a day, employers have reduced working hours to 8-9 hours. With this shortened schedule, there are two types of workers. Some say getting up early and finish early in the evening is better while others say getting up later and working until late at night is better. In my opinion, getting up early has several benefits. 
     First of all, schedule of society is fixed to day workers. In school, students must attend at 9 a.m, so waking up late is impossible. Likewise, company usually fixed their schedule from 9 to 6, so night workers will substituted with day workers if they try to follow their own schedule. Moreover infrastructures such as transportation and shopping stores stop their operation in late night. Night workers cannot use them after finishing work.
     In addition to main schedule of society, getting up early is good for physical health. Usually, night workers skip dinners or eat foods with low nutrition, while day workers eat healthy foods 3 times a day. It makes them healthier. For example, day workers eat at restaurant in company, and night workers eat foods from delivery stores.
     Some argue that there are night workers who are suitable for getting up late, for it makes them more productive. Although companies like start-ups shift their work hours to match the individual life rhythm, this new phenomenon is not widely adapted yet. Before this culture is settled, day workers will have high productivity than night workers who work in companies which have usual fixed schedule.
     To sum up, day workers have several advantages. They matched with main schedule of society which is 9 to 6, and have healthy foods. Despite of efforts to free the individual schedule, it is not widely spread. Until working hours become elastic, getting up early is better strategy than night working."	4.5	4.5	4.5	
603	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"  As modern young grown-ups are communicating with various people including not only family but also friends, opinions whether the former has the most important influence on young adults or the latter does are divided into two groups. Even though some people state that the family is the most important influence on young adults, friends are the most important influence on young adults.
  Above of all, young people are more likely to interact with their friends than family. Since most of them are university students, they may usually  stand on their own; that is, they live apart from their family. Rather, they are prone to get along with their friends. For example, a large number of KAIST students who dwell in dormitories join clubs, which offer a variety of activities with their friends. I heard that some of them eventually establish a start-up, but there are few companies founded with one's family.
  Next, friends may have similar points of view. According to a research conducted by numerous psychologists, groups of people consisted of members who had spent their young ages in similar era are inclined to share common points of view. Therefore, young grown-ups can easily share their ideas and feel a kind of sympathy with their friends.
  Meanwhile, some people insist that the family have a great impact on young adults, based on the amount of time that young people had spent with family. However, adults make their own way by experiencing various events and conducting several roles in our society with friends. In other words, the time spent with family does not ultimately determine one's points of view.
  For the reasons suggested above, young adults are mainly affected by their friends than their family. Thus, try to interact with a number of good friends as many as possible."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0

648	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"There are many argument that it is good to do easy work or not. Some people think that doing only what they already do well is good because it doesn't require any effort. On the otherhand, Many people believe it is great to do something risky because they can get some worthy experiment. Although there are many benefits when we do easy things,   I think it has more good affect to me to do something unfamiliar.

 First and most important reason for it is that we can not do what we have done everytime. When we go to high school, everything we have to learn is alway newthings. Also at universty, we have to learn more deep theory and have to do some unfamiliar things. We just have to adapt to something new everytime, everywhere. 

 By doing some new things, we can experience many things that we haven't had yet. For example, I was afraid to do some research program because I haven't done it before. But I tried to work hard and I could learn many research skills such as manual of reading cylinders and skills of writing reports. Also, by doing some chemistry research project, I could make a decision to go to science highschool. If I had not done some experiment when I was young, I couldn't have gone to this university, KAIST. 

 As we get more experience of new works, we will have more confidence of trying. This ""trying"" can change someone's life. So, I recommend my friend to do something new. I want to say people who worry about 
 trying ;  ""Don't hesitate to do something unfamiliar. It can change your life."""	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
464	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"During the exam period, KAIST students study according to their own study style. Some students study alone in the dormitory or library, and another students study together in a classroom. Some people say that studying with a group of students can cause you to lose concentration and interfere. However, this should not be seen as a problem.  Rather, group studying helps to improve study efficiency.

Until now, many have argued that people become nosiy when they study together. If you study alone, you just blank out of a while.  However, you can waste all your time for chatting when you study with your friends. Maybe, but when you're with the friends, you could save time to waste. For example, when studying alone, there is no one watching, so you keep looking at your cell phone. On the other hand, if you study with a group, another friend can give you a warning whenever you don't concentrate on studying.

There is an advantage when you study with a group of students.  It is easy to solve your curiosity  if you study together. When you are alone, you can solve the problem through only the internet. Or, you have to ask someone else later, so it's hard to solve the curiosity right away. However, you can have a discussion about the problem when you study with your friends. Also, there might be a student who has the same question as you. Or, you may already have a friend who knows the answer to the question. You can share your knowledge with each other and study more deeply.

To sum up, study efficiency is increasing when you study with a group of students. First, you can concentrate on studying  because your frends can give a caution. Also, you can study more deeply for a discussion with your study members. What about study with your friends? You can get higher score for your test."	4.0	4.0	4.5	12.5
1693	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Many students in our college know what we have to take a course or reach scores to graduate KAIST. And most of us generally choose the most difficult one to achieve graduating condition is physical AU. We need to take at least two of them without club activities since it requires 4 AU and each of class gives us 2 AU score. But the problem is that all of those courses has really low attending limit, so we cannot easily take it. So, some students suggest that if one go dedicate to national defence by being soldier for 18 months, then he can get 2 physical AU. I totally agree with this statement and I would like to explain why I think in this way.
 First reason is that there are increasing students who feel that the period when they work for troop is just wasting time. As alternative way in our school gets even harder to conduct, many students are considering working for national defense. Nevertheless, almost all of us do not want to go there and we even cannot take any course what we want to take in there. Thus, if we can get AU by going there, we can get meaningful result on our requirement of graduation even it is small.
 Second, we can potentially expand the attending limit of those courses. As I have introduced, it is really difficult to take physical activity courses. For me, I could not take even one of them for six semesters, even though I always have handed in that I wanted to take those courses. However, if we were able to get 2 AU from other activity, the demand for those course would be lowered and this might allow us to take them more easily.
 To sum up, I hope our college gives us 2 AU by conducting the national defends for the above reason I have explained. Even though there are some opposite opinions regarding this idea, but I believe KAIST needs to be a college which carefully hears the opinion of their students. Also, I hope our school president would consider this idea and we can get a positive outcome by that."	4.5	4.0	3.5	12.0

But I always try to do my best in doing what I like. So I think I could change something about what I like if I change one important thing about my country. 

 When I was 15 years old, I am fascinated in math. And until now, I like math. I think that I could like math in future. I think that the person who enjoys works would be succeed. Thus I would change something in mathematics. 

 Also, I tried to be good at mathematics. When I was in middle school, I had a complex which I am not good a math. But I tried hard to study math and solve much more problems than other students. In this process, I was going to enjoy it. So I could get the first grade in my highschool!

 In addition, I have good experiences. In my highschool, I studied with my friend about math and discuss each other several times. It was so helpful for me understanding math.

Therefore, the most important thing I would like to change is making my country become a developed country, especially in scientific. In a developed country, there are many of modern machines that help people's life, make them work easier, have a happy life and treat diseases. 

First, in algriculture with up-to-date technic, people can grow more rice, vegetables, fruits, etc. with less physical work. In addition, the product will be fresher, higher quanlity and cheaper, the products can be exported to foreign countries. People in my country still have to grow rice, watering vegetables and trees by their hands. That waste a lot of physical effort. 

Second, morden machine can help doctors diagnose diseases earlier, somes even can treat specific diseases without drugs. Nowaday, there are more and more new diseases. Lack of new technic leads to late of diagnosing and finding treatment. COVID 19 is a dangerous disease that make lots of people die and we need vacine for treatment. Obviously, we can not figure out the right vacine without developed scientific.

Finally, good machines can help protect our border from instruders both on land and sea. Absolutely, war machine is not good if we use it in wrong purpose, making war with other countries. However, they are really neccessary to defense the country from being attacked by the others. The more powerful and modern weapons, the higher security that the country can get. Once people in a country being safe, they can live a happy life and work effectively.

There are much more good things that we can have with a developed scientific. Therefore, I really want to develop my country firstly on this field."	3.5	3.0	2.5	9.0
745	You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"The problem of dormitory is one of the important things to university students. And, most of dormitory problems are caused by other people in dormitory rooms. Thus, it is the big issue to choose between having the university assign a student and choosing their own roommate. Although some people argue that pairing unknown roommate is better to students, my argument is that student should choose their roommate. There are three reasons in terms of stress because of uncertainty and development.
 First,  having university assign a student makes another student feel stress. There are three things that human beings should have, also known as clothes, food, and house. It means house that is place to sleep is important to human beings. So, if student's roommate is uncertain, that fact affects student's mental. All people are different. It takes many time to fit student's life pattern with their roommate for example food, language, and sleeping. Taking this time at every semester is waste of time. 
 Despite the above reason, some people said that new roommates is better because receiving new experiences is important to university students. However, university already give students new experiences through the lectures, activities, laboratories, and even clubs. Students always face with new situations. It makes students better and more creative, but this environment is quite stressful to students. Then, students should have their own place to feel comfortable and calm. That is dormitory. If students feel uncomfortable at the dorm, students' abilities will decrease.
 Because of two reasons, it is better to give the choice right to select their own roommate. University represents the freedom and responsibility. However, making forced roommate is giving students only responsibility except for freedom.  University should be the place of freedom at every areas even the dormitory."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0
2066	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" I think every sports is good hobby for all of college students.
 It’s because activity sports like soccer, basketball, table tennis and so on are effective at enhancing our health and for side effect, we can use our energy so that we can sleep at early night. That is, if I drank a cup of coffee to get my concentration and do a work out with my hobby, I don’t have to worry about the early sleep. When the time’s close to midnight, I get too exhausted to stay awake.
 Second, it’s also really effective at conserving my body’s posture. I felt this is true during my work out-days. Almost 6 months from January to July, I have done the work out 5 hours a week. And I felt my body’s posture is well-positioned. I think this is because the muscles of my body is get bigger and my bones next to muscle are also well-positioned. Because of this chain effect, I can get focused on my posture even in working or studying. So If I have a hobby in sports, I can expect I can get this useful and helpful side effect.
 Lastly, if I have any sports hobby, I am able to attend the sports club. In sports club, of course we can easily get the person who want to play sports games with me. And playing with club members, we can even expect the friendship with members. I think this is really good side effect because I attended here to have fun with sports game, but there’s other entertainment by getting close with club members. 
 For this three reasons, having hobby of sports is very good choice in college. I heard that, in germany, about 70% of adult have there own sports club and it found that doing sports is helpful of enhancing work efficiency and friendship. Then, why don’t you get any sports for your hobby? Thank you for your reading."	2.5	1.5	2.0	6.0
998	Lifestyle: Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer	"I prefer doing only what I already do well to trying new things and taking risks. Because if I did not succeed in doing new things, then my proud would became lower and lower. For people, an proud is very important in order to live their life, since it makes their performance of everything they do better. If they lose it, then they may do not well on their work. For example, let's suppose I took a course and I got A0. Then next semester, I took a challenging course and I got B0. Then I would lose proud, so in the next semester, I would not do well as I did in the first semester.

Nowadays, many people do bitcoin in order to earn money. They always have to take risks. Nevertheless, Most of them lose their money. This shows that challenging is like an casino game, which only depends on their luck. If they study bitcoin a lot, then they may be do well respectively, but it still depends on their luck. If they only depend their luck when they do bitcoin, they may lose a lot of money, or even lose all of their money, or have to get a help of loan. Challenging is very dangerous, in this point of view.

Also, people naturally prefer stablity to challenging, according to many research results. It is their natural property. When we choose our job, we tend to choose what we can do well instead of what we like to do. It's because what we can do well makes stable money to live our life. Passion is also important, but only passion without ability makes people poor in majority of cases. Thus, we can figure out that most people think that stablity is the most important value in their life.

For instance, for who likes science and math, doctor is very excellent job, in comparison to researcher or scientist. Do you think that it is because all of them like doctor's job? The answer is definitely No. They may really like do experiment, and do research. However, doctor earns a lot of money and it makes their life stable. This shows most people prefer stablity very much. Similarly, public work employee is one of the very popular jobs in Korea past 25 years.

For the reasons I stated above, we can realize that doing only what we already do well is way better than trying new things and taking risks."	3.0	2.5	3.0	
180	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Did you knew that KAIST(Korea Advanced Institution of Science and Technology) requires all kinds of science and math such as biology, chemistry, and linear algebra as a primary courses for freshmen? Not only KAIST, but also many university in Korea used to demand their student to study many subjects as many as they can. According to these examples, I think university that requires their students to take various courses is better than others. Then, why universities that courage students to deal with many subjects are better?
       First of all, world which we are living in has multiple complex problems. Unlike prior world, human kinds are facing difficult issues like global warming or nuclear issues. Theses kind of problems cannot be solved without various perspective and approches. This means that specialist who is only specialized in one subject cannot solve complex problems or misled easily. Thus, it should be better to require students to face various subjects and experience enormous kinds of problem within.
       Moreover, dealing with many subjects can be helpful for improving student's insight. Even if two different subjects are dealing with same problem, each subject's goals and approches has lots of difference. For example, thermodynamics in physics is used to predict how universe will change in the future. But, thermodynamics in chemistry is used to estimate whether this reaction is spontaneous. Eventually, when we study various subjects which taught us many kinds of techniques to solve problems, it will improve our insight toward world.
      In short, studying various courses and subjects can make us live well in world with complex problems and give us brilliant insights. Therefore, university which gives students a oppertunnity to deal with various subjects is better than university which requires students to be specialized."	3.5	4.0	4.0	11.5
2128	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Adavantages of Watich Online Video lectures
        Since the first semester of 2020, people started online lectures because of the global infectious disease COVID-19.  Therefore, students watched lecture videos instead of going live lectures. People say online lecutres have some disadvantages for studying. Of course, it is true, but many students said there are more advantages than disadvantges when we watch online video lectures. There are two big advantages of watching online video lectures vesus viewing live lectures in a traditional class room.
        First, student can watch the lecture anywhere and anytime they want. When students go to the classroom and view live lectures in there, they feel its boring and tired. If the lecture is scheduled in 9 am, then student should wake up before 8 am to prepare. On the other hand, students don’t have to wake up early and go to the classroom in online lectures. They can watch the lecture in dormitorty, home, or anywhere they want. Also if the lecture is recorded video and given to students, then they can watch the same lecture at 9 pm, not 9 am. It means that students can watch the lecture when they want. It is a very big advantage.
        Second, students can watch the lecture again. When students go to the classroom and view live lectures, they cannot watch it again. Therefore, if you don’t pay attention for a moment, you can’t hear what professor said again. On the other hand, since the many online lecture are given as a video, students can watch it again. If they missed something in lecture. It is very big advantage because if we can watch it again and find some missing things, it helps students to study hard and helps not to miss the assignments.
        To sum up, Online video lectures have two big advantages versus viewing live lecture in classroom. Since, the lectures are given as the video and students don’t have to go to the classroom, they can watch the lectures anywhere and anytime they want. Also, because lectures are given as video, students can watch the lecture again. It helps students to find some missing things and study hard. As this essay shows, watching online video lectures have many advantages versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom. "	4.0	4.0	3.5	11.5
1324	In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Did you see any movie that tell you what is friend? I saw many, and especially one movie that shows real friendship of three friends made me surprised. After I saw that movie, I believe the qualities of a real good friend are 'honest', 'belief', and 'to believe each other'.

First quality is honest, but actually honest don't contain the meaning of 'do not lie'. Let's suppose that One man in hard situation tell ""Everything goes well!"" to his friend, then think about it. He would say that for some reasons such like ""I don't want him to know my situation, because he would worry it"". Honest that I want to tell you means 'to tell his friend for friend'. The relation between friends who truely think for each other is strong.

Secone quality is belief. To become real friend, he(or she) should have belief, because person who doesn't have belief easily change his(or her) own thinking. I call that kind of people 'one drop of water in the ocean.'. When wind blows, water goes and back with the direction of wind without its own thinking. This relation that 'A goes and B traces' will easily be broken.

Last one is 'to believe each other'. Everyone may think it when writing this essay. We all know the importance of it, so I would not say much about it. Just I want to tell you is 'this quality tells whether relation between people exist'. I strongly believe 'To believe' is the first step when people meet each other and get relationship.

I choose this three, because I think the qualities of good friend mean the 'long and deep relation'. If we have real good friends, we will meet them for long time. 'To believe' makes the first step to be good friend, 'Belief' makes them fun and think other way, and 'Honest' feel their friends good. T"	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

"  I want to change education system in my country, Korea. Few years ago, I was under in high school in Korea. I felt there are so many unnecessary things in education course. In my opinion, student should choose subjects like university. There are several reasons why I want to change education system.
  First, There are too many subjects.  When student in middle school, student learn fundermental things. however, student learn specific things in high school.  Threre are some disadvantage. For example, some student don't want to learn math. Because, they don't need too specific mathmetical knowleage and mathmetical idea. If student can choose subject, this student may not learn math, and learn more useful subject for them.
  Second, student can learn deeper. For example, math education course 's volume in high school is decreaing  becase of class time issue. If student can choose subject, student who want to learn math may choose many math courses, and they can learn deeper. Korea's math course teach too finite area. It is also in other high school education couse.
 Third,  It can decrease competition. Nowdays, knowleage is not important. For example, In economic class in high school, economic knowleage is not important. That is only memorized text need for test score. Most of student don't have any interest in meaing of text. If student can choose subject, diversity of subject will increase. So, student can focus on their interesting subject. In my opnion, student may feel less stress becasue that subject is not only for competiton.
  For these reasons, if I could change one important thing about my country, I would change education system. It can make Korea students happy and fun high school."	3.0	3.5	3.0	9.5
1575	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	I think worst thing of my country is too much competing. Furthermore, reason of this phenomenon is that there are many things which universities want. So, I want to change things that universities order. These days, they make high school students write individual introduction paper 3500 letters and participate many museum and, study hard to the top while they are in school. But, this is so busy that many high school students choose dying. As we know, university students are busy but I don't think high school students don't need to be busy. So, I want to remove individual introduction paper because it is not important. If you want to estimate students, see the school life record paper not individual introduction paper. For example, KAIST pass three students who copy other people's introduction paper. Other example is DGIST. In my high school students write only 2500 letters but university order 3500 letters. However the result is pass so many students who are in my school think individual introduction paper is garbage one. To sum up, individual introduction paper is trash so I want eliminate this, and this will decrease high school students' concern.	2.5	2.5	3.0	8.0
2141	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"At the most serious COVID-19 period, all classes in the world were opened online. According to this, students are using laptop or tablet in class. I think there are  many advantages of using these not only in online class, but also in offline class.
  First, students can search their all of questions in the class immediately. Including me, many students can't understand all of the class, but there are few questions in class. I think the reason is that students think their questions are too easy and they think all students can't give their all of questions during the class time. However, each student can search their own questions on the internet with tablet or labtop. Then, professor can use class time full and all students can solve their lots of questions.
  Second, students can write and save their memo during class safely. Some students make memo for everyday class and use them on individual studying. Suppose that they make it on paper note, then it can be lost, wet, torn easily if the student don't care them everytime. However, if they make it on tablet or labtop, they can get away from managing the papers. They can clear the files with folder system, and freely use it when they individually study.
  Third, Students can move lightly. They have several classes everyday, then they have to carry their thick textbooks. If several classes are continued right away, then students have to run to next classroom with their heavy bags. However, only one tablet or labtop can be instead of the heavy bag. they can save the thick textbooks without additional weight.
  I wrote three advantages of using tablet or labtop in class. It is very helpful for students' comfortable campus life. There will be many advantages for professors too. And I think nobody can't stop this technologically changing life. By developing technology continuously, people will use it to make more efficient and comfortable life."	3.0	3.0	3.0	9.0
299	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are many students in KAIST who think between taking classes in many subjects for fusion and specializing in one subject for getting strength in one field. I think that specializing in one subject is better than taking classes in many subjects. There are three reasons for my opinion.

First of all, if we take classes in many subjects, we cannot have a lower specialty in one field. For example, in the Department of Materials Science & Engineering, all students are taught about the introduction of chemistry, physics, and biology. It may seem good, but many students can't get depth knowledge about any one field of science. So, it eventually can make students lose their force to perform strong studies, and lose at competing among other science major students.

Moreover, specializing in even one subject is very hard for university students. According to my lab professor, there are many students to do double major for achieving fusion between two major. However, he said that there are also many students that miss their core major subject since they are so busy to take other major classes to get a title of double major. So, he advised that concentrating on one subject is much better than taking classes in many subjects. And in his empirical, it is said that students who study one subject in depth usually do better performance in graduate school.

Finally, students who specialize in one subject can get a better opportunity in the field of industry. Compared to the students who take classes in many subjects, they have a bigger possibility to solve an industrial problem because they have a higher understanding of one field. So, they will catch more opportunity to revise an industrial problem.

For these reasons, I think that specializing in one subject has more strength than taking classes in many subjects. Although the students who specialize in one subject may be hard to fusion two subjects, I think that the fusion of the two subjects is possible for students who already specialize in one field. So, as I mentioned before, specializing in one subject is better."	3.5	4.0	3.5	11.0
1630	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	There are some reasons why i prefer online lecture. The biggest benefit is that i can listen to it wherever i want. Instead of moving busy from place to place to attend the class, all we need is just to turn on the laptop and watch the video. Due to that i can save lot of time everyday. And those saved time will be helpful in many ways. Second. We can watch lecture video again and again until i got to understand it. In offline lecture, the only way to remember the content of it was to write a note. But now I can just watch the lecture again. That is really precious. Still there are few disadvantages, but online lecture have great benefits too. I like it.	2.5	2.0	2.0	6.5
421	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" I believe that university students should attend classes. There are 3 reasons for my opinion. 

First, when you attend classes, you can interact with professors. I think what we can learn from class is not just knowledges but also interaction with professors and wisdom from professors. I am happy to listen to professor's experience and many lessons. 

Second, we can focus more deeply. In my case, when I study alone, I can't focus on for long time. I often use my smartphone. However, when I took classes, I just listened to professors and I could learn fast and efficiently.

Last, communication with friends is very important. Nowadays, COVID-19 is becoming more and more serious issues. Before that event, we can go to school, join a club and meet many friends. In college, we can highly develop our communcation skills through many clubs or festivals etc,,,,,,,,. However, now we could not meet our friends offline. Attending class is one of a way to communicate with many people. 

Therefore I think it is really important to force students attend classes. Although some people don't agree with me, I think there are so many advantages when students take classes."	3.0	3.5	3.5	10.0
529	Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"I prefer to spend time with one or two close friends for several reasons.
 One is that it is hard  for me to communicate with person that doesn't have same interests. People often talk about where they did go on weekend, or delicious liquors, or games that are popular, such like that. But I'm mainly interested in quite strange things, such as school study, or games that isn't popular, etc. So, it is hard to find  people has same interests with me, so when I spend time with friends, I find a few of friends that have same interests with me; therefore, I spend time with a few friends.
 The second reason is that I feel uncomfortable when many people focus on me. This is my character from when I was a child. In lunch time at school, I spent time in classroom or libraries, when others play soccer in playground. I merely experienced to spend time with many friends, so It is hard to stay with many people for me.
 At last, I don't have many friends. As mentioned before, I like to stay alone and focus on what I'm really interested, so I don't have enough time to make friends. So I have a small number of friends; therefore I hang out with small number of friends.
 In summary, I like to spend time with a small number of friends that have same interests with me."	1.5	2.0	2.5	6.0
101	Government: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.    	"Governments Should Spend More on Public Transportations

Recently, cities are being more and more bigger and complicated. People tend to like the cities because the cities have more infra than the countryside. This phenomena is noticeable for the big cities; for example, Seoul, New York, and Beijing are complicated. Therefore, the traffic problems are appearing in those countries which have big cities, and there is two big different views. Although some say governments should spend more money on the roads and highways, I would say public transportation is more important in terms of three points.
First of all, the population is growing in world-wide. Human beings have improved agriculture methods and medical knowledges, and this makes the population pop-up from the 100 million to the 700 million. Increasing so fast, human beings are gathering up together and make the big city. The city with a huge population have also a big area, so people needs transportation to move on. Therefore, the government should build more public transportation to solve this.
The following reason for the population problem is traffic problem. In these days, almost every families have their own cars. Without the public transportations, they definitely ride their vehicles when they are going shopping or going to work. This induces a terrible traffic jam during every morning and evening. However, If there are enough public transports, less cars go out to the roads and less traffic jam will be happened.
The opponents will insist that building more roads can solve those problems, but it is not. To increase the amount of the roads and highways, some space will be needed. However, the big cities have already too much roads and buildings to make more roads and highways. Building more roads in these cities should contain destruction of buildings or expanding the city, and this makes just more complicated city and traffic jam. On the other hand, improving public transportation does not need any expansion. Thus, more effective and economical.
To summarize, governments should spend money on improving public transport. Three reasons are given for this, even if some says roads and highways are more important. Improving public transport is necessary in terms of population, traffic, and spacing, and this will improve the city life, too."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
760	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I prefer to study together for two reasons. First, classmates would encourage me when I want to give up and rest. Last year, I did a group study for general physics course. However, because I made my appointments, I could stick to my homework and make it.
The other reason is that one can be more creative. When I face a difficult problem, I can get a hint from others. By sharing various opinions and perspectives, one can get an wide angle of thinking. I studied more effectively when I did together.
I respect students who study alone as well. But from my experience, It is better to study with other students."	1.0	1.0	1.5	3.5
1858	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Cultures have a great power and we can see this power in online. I thinks that BTS, the most famous K-pop artist, is great example in tinfluence people's behatviorhat case. I think videos 


First of all, Movies and TV Program are combined the society. 
Producer who make movies and his or her co-worker should analyse about what is popular and funny in people's mind. So people get fun from that movies,
Second, video can give more stimulation than other material.
More than 60 years ago, the only device that can get informations in korea is radio. radio sends sound and people hear that. In this case, people only use thier ears. However, In this time, videos are main tools that spread informations. During COVID-19 pandemic, video flatform such as youtube, Netflix and wavve etc can fastest grow and we see a movie in that flatform. This fact give some idea that Movies and TV program can create cultural power for people, too.
Last reason, popular makes wave in culture.
Anyone can make culture wave for thier own's benefit. If people don't like specific culture, culture is destroy in that time. We already know great example in China. China goverment still tried to chinese culture spread in many country like K-pop, but they get failure.

2078	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Students in college could have multiple good hobbies. For hobbies to be considered good they should either aid in self development or help the society in some way. For college students good hobbies could mainly be classified into three groups hobbies in research, hobbies in clubs and hobbies in academics. 
           In hobbies for research, students could participate in a lab.s under the guidance of a professor. The students can either be part of the experiment or be part of the researchers. Being part of the experiment is simple students will be asked to follow certain procedures depending on the guidlines of the lab. they are participating in. For example, If the expeiment is taking place in biology lab. where the researchers are measuring EEG, students will be asked to remove their jewlery and take a sit on a chair and relax while the reseachers measure stundents brain wave activities. On the other hand if students are a part of the resarch, they will work hand in hand with the professor conducting experiments. For example, If the research is taking place in computer science lab. students will be asked to develop software that gives a desired output. The students will then look into the ""open source"" and find codes that might be usefull in their reseach, they will then modify the code and subject it to test cases until they get the desired output.
          In hobbies in clubs, students usually apply for the clubs that they are passionate about.  After the application process is over the club leaders hand pick students that they think showed the most passion among the people who applied. After this process is over the students usually work on group activites with the club members. For example if a student has applied and is accepeted in the music club, he/she will have the chance to sing with the club members and have a good time. In addition he/she could have the chance to perform to the whole campus.
          In hobbies in academics, students usually spend their time mainly in libraries. their dorms or with professors, either studying for or asking questions about the courses. For example, a student who is currently taking the physics course could watch a youtube video in his dorm about how to caluclate the speed of light.
          In conclusion, good hobbies are hobbies that help in either self development or help the society in some way. In college good hobbies can be mainly classified into three main groups hobbies in research which help students understand how to work hand in hand with professors and undestand how to conduct experiments, hobbies in clubs which help students explore their passion and have the chance to show thier passion to the world,and hobbies in academics which help the students understand more about the courses."	4.0	4.0	3.5	11.5
