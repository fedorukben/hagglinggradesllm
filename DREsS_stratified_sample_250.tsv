2189	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  My university has many advantages, but I want to change one important thing. These days, students take online classes by zoom, which is people use to have online classes. After COVID 19, students will have to take face-to-face classes in buidings. I want to change this system. I am in favor of taking classes by zoom after COVID 19 for these three reasons.
 FIrst of all, students can reduce time. In my opinion, today I got up early and walked 20 minutes to take a class in the morning. If it is not face-to-face class, I can sleep more time or do something. And after class, I walked 20 minutes to back to my dormitory. I have to spend time to take face-to-face classess, whereas I can study more things such as reading lecture notes or doing my homework.  Spending time to go is not efficient. 
   Second, students can reduce expenses. Some students buy bikes or lend something to ride, but they do not need if they can take classes by zoom. Buying bikes and automobiles are expensive for students. In addition, if they lend bikes or something to ride, they have to spend much expense.  
  Third, students feel free to spend time when they do not have class. Although there is just one class in a week, students tend to stay in dormitories because of transportation expenses. On the other hand,  if students can take classes by zoom, they can go home or trip when they don't have class. 
   In my opinion, students do not have to take face-to-face classes. It is true that there are some advantages when students take face-to-face classes, but it should be noted that students can save their time and reduce expenses by using zoom. So I think taking classes on the internet is better than offline classes.   "	5.0	4.5	4.5	14.0

915	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Benefits of Learning Variously

             Recently many kinds of fields have appeared, and the relationship between the fields has become more complex. In order to understand a field seriously, he or she needs to know some concepts from other fields like mathematics or chemistry.  Nowadays, many students are wondering multiple disciplines are helpful or not. I believe that students have to take classes in many subjects for some reasons.
             Firstly, students can learn various ideas from many kinds of subjects. Each subject like mathematics or economics requires different kinds of ideas or abilities. For example, mathematics requires rigorous proofs; however, economics requires explanations based on real life. Each idea can be useful for each situation. Therefore, students who know various ideas from different kinds of subjects have the potential to deal with various situations.
             Secondly, students can meet many other students in various fields. Since working together is pretty frequent nowadays, building communication skills and the relationships between many other people in various fields is important. Attending many classes of various majors gives opportunities of communicating with other students from different majors to students. Consequently, students who take classes in many subjects will be able to work with other coworkers more smoothly.
             Although some argue that specializing in one subject is the best for researching subjects, learning many subjects is helpful for improving the level of research. Many difficult problems like human disease can be solved with help of several fields. Moreover, people who know well in several fields can know a wider range of problems in this world. That is the reason why professors with various bases can find the topics of research easily.
             In conclusion, students who take classes in various subjects have the potential for becoming better workers and researchers. Taking many classes in many subjects not only can make students build wider relationships and good communication skills but also help them find research topics easily. Hence, students should take classes in many subjects."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
1737	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I agree that KAIST is perfect school but there is some things to improve with the system. To graduate in KAIST, there are lots of things to satisfy. One thing  is P.E. AU. It means every students have to  take 2 or more P.E. class  to graduate. I don't think this rule is a problem, I think P.E. is very important class for students so this is essential. The problem is that there are  so little classes opens in a semester. So I want to change this thing.
First of all, It makes students to graduate harder. This is fundamental reason of it. This year, there was so much students to listen this class so some students who are graduating semester, even didn't take the course. It made students to graduate 6 months later. It is a vert big thing that the lifecycle delays about 6 months in 20+ year old  students.
Another thing is that we can't take other courses that we want. In KAIST, we randomly get the courses for we have applied. Because of the mentioned problem, many students apply P.E. class for every semester. But, these courses are 3 hours class  not 1.5, 1.5 hours class than can occupy a lot of space in timetable. So this problem resulted students to make their timetable difficult.
These are reasons of why this problem is a thing to improve. Now I'll talk about the solutions. I suggests 2 solution. 
First solution is most intuitive solution, just making lots of classes and lots of student to take in a 1 course. I think this can help students. Even more, it can make a variation of classes. I think we don't have various subjects in KAIST. This can be another benefit/
Other solution is military AU. If we make it, students who went military can be  satistfy graduate rules. Then there will be less students to take course and it will solve the problem. Furthermore, it will be very big benefit to students who go to military. 18 months not studying and working at army is very big  loss to students plus the country.
In conclusion, I sensed the thing  that P.E. classes are too less in KAIST is a big problem  because it makes graduate difficult and it can effect other courses. So I suggested 2 solutions,  simply making more classes and military AU. I think there are more problems in KAIST even KAIST is very good university. Finding problems and thinking about its solution will be very beneficial to KAIST and others."	5.0	4.0	4.0	13.0
1447	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"KAIST is one of the best university in Korea. It has good science instruments, good professors and good students. In my opinion, everything in KAIST is perfect. However, I think it would be better to change the location from Daejeon to Seoul. Some Kaistians will not agree to my thought because they are now comfortable with the KAIST in Daejeon. I will explain several reasons of changing location from Daejeon to Seoul.

  First, we can have more opportunities to get a job. Many cooperations and companies are located in Seoul. This means that students will likely to interact often with companies. For example, student can experience job fairs, company tour with ease. Also when we do job interview in the company's building which is located in Seoul, students who are not familiar with the region will not feel comfortable. 

  Second reason is that we can cooperate with other universities easily. Most major universities such as Seoul National University and Korea University are located in Seoul. We can cooperate with them through the online. But, it is more powerful to meet face to face. I heard that labs in KAIST are doing co-research with many universities. If the location is changed, process of research will be much more effective.

  Finally, more students will eager to enter the KAIST. Every students knows that KAIST is best university. However, some high school students do not prefer to enter the KAIST. I think the biggest reason is that KAIST located in Daejeon. High school students would prefer Seoul. When I was high school students, most of students wanted to go universities in Seoul. One reason is that good universities are  located in Seoul. The other reason is that there are many facilites they can enjoy ,and they can meet many other university students easily. If many students want to enter KAIST, it is good for KAIST. This is because many smart students will enter the KAIST.

  In conclusion, I would like to change the location of KAIST from Daejeon to Seoul. We can have more chance to get a job. We can coopoerate with other universities easily. More students will want to enter KAIST."	5.0	4.5	4.0	13.5
486	University: Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Advantages of Choosing Roommates Instead of Using Assigned Roommate
Many students live in the dormitory for several reasons. Some live there because of the distance, while some of them live dorm because of the cost. Although some students want to have a chance to make friends with roommates which university make for, dormitory is, in my opinion, some kind of house for students, so students should choose their own roommates. First, there could be a trouble if a student who school assign for the student. Next, students could their own hobby or interest with roommate who chosen by them.
To begin with, students spend their own time on the dormitory, and it is important to feel comfortable on that time. People have all different own character, it is same for the students. Thus, the roommate that is not own roommate would make a significant difference between them; then, the room could not be the best place to rest and they would always fight. In my own case, I was used the random roommate 2 years ago. At the first meeting, he seems to be a good person; however, few weeks later, he was not a clean man. He took a shower once per three days and left food for a one week on the desk. The smell of the room was terrible and the room was not feeling good for me. 
On top of that, as mentioned earlier, students spend a lot of time on their dorm. Students are not a machine for studying, so they should play for a several hours then they enjoy their own time as well. At that time, roommate could be a best partner to play with. Although random roommate could have the same hobby, the possibility is too low and if they choose their roommate, then it is one hundred percent coincidence with the roommate. Also, if the roommate has different interest, he or she have to find out friends outside of the dorm; it might be a time wasting.
On the other hand, some might say that random roommates could be a opportunity to make a new friend. Because there are not that much time for playing, they can easily contact a new person without effort. However, there are so many clubs in universities and it could be the better chance than the random roommate. They have the same interest, and it could help them more familiar easily.
To sum up, it could be a hard time for students when they are not matched on lifestyle which make problem between them. Assigning is not an efficient way for students rest as well. In addition, they have lots of other manner to make a new friend. Therefore, the university are not responsible for assigning the roommate because it could make the better result if students choose."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

1766	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are many problems in S.Korea. The rich get richer, The poor get poorer.  And, not only the market system, there are many minor problem include military system.  If  I could change one important thing about S.Korea, I want to change the military service system.
First, girls also should go to military service. S.Korea's male should go to military service at when they are 20 years-old for about 2 years. They spend their important times of 20s in the military. Through girls' military service, we can reduce this period.  Also, more  than 90% of S.Korea's male should go to military service. It means you can walk and you are a male of S.Korea, you should go to military service  nevertheless you have a minor lack. This percentage is more than the Nazzi, Germany. If girls go to military service there can be more soldier and we can protect some males who are not fit in the military service and could get higher quality of  army  by reducing the percentage of males' military sercvice.
Second, S.Korea government should give more sevice to the soldier.  In the law, employeer should give more than 8720 won per a hour. According to this law, the soldier of S.Korea should get at least 2 milions won per a month. However,  the government gives them less than 500 thousands won per a month. Also,  the government should improve the quality of the food.  The price of the meal to the soldier is less than 5000 won per a meal. Nevertheless they go to military sevice to protect the country, why they should eat low-quality food?
In conclusion I want change the military service system of  the S.Korea. I want to change two things, girls' military service and the service to the soldier. Those two things should be done because we should improve the quality of the military. The problem of military is not just the problem of 20 years-old boys. The boys could be boyfriends, brothers and the problem also could be lead to protecting ability of S.Korea. So, I argued we should focus on the military's problem more and more."	4.5	4.0	3.5	12.0

437	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Why I choose to study alone
 There are many ways to focus on study. Someone uses timer, someone uses blocker app which blocks distracting application and Internet sites, and someone move place to study cafe. There are some people who try to help focusing each other by making study group. I don't think this is solely bad idea, however, I prefer studying alone rather than studying with a group of students because of several reason.
 First, it takes too much time to get familiar with whom study with me. It looks easy, however, I have timid personality which makes me frozen when I try to talk to others. For example, when I started group study about English speaking, I couldn't say English sentences fully because I was too frustrated. It didn't get better until I leave the study group.  Even though it is non-verbal studying group, I am nervous because of thought that other students will see me. It keeps me not to do other things rather than studyng, but it also hinders me to focus on studying. 
 Second, studying group with friendly people is inefficient. It would be better if group members promised not to do any private acts, however, it is not easy. This gets worse if group members are friends, in order to get rid of the effect of my introvert personality. For example, I usually found myself who spent two and half hours just to eat dinner with other members. If I studied alone, I would spend only a half hour for simple meal. Also, we usually said jokes and tricked each other while studing. It is definitely waste of time. 
 Third, studying alone enhances my ability to focus on. Basically, we have a lot of things to focus on in society. Researching, working at company, or designing products are all example that requires focusing. In those cases, you cannot expect any help. You should solve your problem while other people do not care about how you are doing but only care about what you have done.  To prepare all of those works, the ability to focus on with only one's power is required. Studying alone is the best way to enhance your focusing ability since you should do all of the works by your own. 
 To sum up, there are not much advantages to study with other students. I have hard time when group members are not familiar and I waste so much time when group members are friends. Also, studying alone has its own benefit that enhances my focusing ability a lot. Other people might have different idea because they have different personalities and experiences compared to me. Anyway, I would choose studying alone by myself, rather than making studying group. "	4.0	4.5	4.0	12.5
1540	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" KAIST is great university. It has lots of great professors and students, researching atmosphere with passion, and massive information for study. But I think there is the only one thing  that KAIST should change. KAIST should make a tunnel through Hill Eoeun. It probably sounds weird, so now I'll explain why the tunnel should be constructed now.
  First reason is that student in western KAIST dormitory can't excess their lecture rooms well. Many of KAIST lectures are provided in eastern or northern buildings, especially E11. The western dormitory is in the opposite site from them through the hill. According to the interview of a student living in Heemang dormitory, ""We should go around the hill everyday."" He added, ""If I want to go to N1, I should start walking advanced to 30 minutes.""
  Second, there is no people in the dormitory this semester. Constructing tunnel could make a lot of noise to students who live in a dormitory. However, now there are only few students because COVID-19 limited students not to get into the dormitory. So, it seems to be a great chance to make a tunnel in this semester. According to the statistics, even if we get vaccine of the virus this March, the mass immune would be created since this November 2021.
  The final reson is that we can get a cool passage during the summer season. Tunnel is quite chill because it is in underground. This could provide cool passage without making any air conditioning structure. Students have to take a long way to reach dormitory with hot condition. By this tunnel, students could get into the dormitory in less tired condition. So, it could make a less electiricity usage.
  It is the timing to make a giant tunnel throught Hill Eoeun. Western dormitory students claim for their imcomfortableness accessing the dormitory. Also, this is the best timing to build it with less pain of constructing noise. Also, we could get a cool place without using extra electricity.There aren't many students in a dormitory because of the COVID-19 situation, so probably we don't need it this year. However, we can feel the imconfortableness when we restart a face-to-face lecture after the situation. So, we need to start to make a tunnel through Hill Eoeun."	4.0	4.5	4.0	12.5
595	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"Almost every students in university are young adults. They spend their time with friends, family, professors to gain something good. 'Something good' can be happiness, joy, money or knowledge. While spending hours with other people, they are being similar with each other. In this situation, who are the most important influence on young adults? I think the answer is 'friends'. Friends influence on young adults each other a lot. This essay will show readers why they are most important.

The first reason is amount of time with each other. Almost every young adults spend there leisure time only with friends. In fact, university students in Korea spend almost 50% of their time on leisure time. The quantitative time of spending hour with friends is very big, so friends are the most important influence on each other. In KAIST, students are living in there own dormitory, not in there house. So they use almost 100% of their time with friends, so they are being similar with each other. This can be a nice example.

Second, amount of talk with friend is the most. We are living in the 'age of smart phone', so huge wave of information flows all around the world. As people catch that wave from SNS when the information is born, it is hard to make talk subject between SNS lovers and someone who don't interests in SNS. SNS lovers only talk about trend, and the others only talk about the past. That situation can be held in family. However, young adult friends have same talk source because almost every students uses SNS. This makes young adults to talk with only each other, so they influence each other a lot. That makes friends are the most important influence.

The third reason is no generation gap is existing between friends. Many 50 years old people loves mountain walking, many 30 years old people likes baseball and almost every 10 years old people loves smart phone games. This generation gap makes them being similar with only each other who have same hobby. As there is no hobby between friends, they are the most important influence with each other.

There are no generation gap between friends, and quantitative amount of spending time with friend is very big. As they talk with friends more than their family, young adults are being similar with each other, so they are the most important influence for themselves. However, only talk with same generation is not good point. Older people can gives us how to live, and young children can gives us hope and new technology. It is important to talk with other generation so that we can grow up as a good adult."	3.5	4.5	4.0	12.0
1412	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"   KAIST, our university, has many differences from other universities. First of all, KAIST is the Institute of Science and Technology, with only departments with natural science and engineering. There are many departments in KAIST such as mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, physics, and more. Freshmen in KAIST go to School of Freshmen which they can study basic subjects of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and programming. Students in KAIST choose their major subject as they go to second grade. The purpose of the School of Freshmen is to give opportunity to explore many subjects. I think this is the biggest difference compared to other universities. In spite of School of Freshmen provides opportunity of exploring many subjects to students, I think there are more disadvantages of School of Freshmen. If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I would like to change the system of School of Freshmen.

   First, there are many students who have already decided their major subject. In my case, I am interested in computer science, so I have decided to go to School of Computing even before the admission. I think some basic subjects such as mathematics and English are essential for all majors, but some subjects such as physics, chemistry, and biology might not be helpful unless the student choose the related major. It might be a waste of time to students who have already decided the major. Furthermore, these students would like to study more about subjects they are interested in. Basic subjects which are mandatory might make students harder to study their interested subjects.

   Second, taking all classes of basic subjects might cause bad effects on student's grade. Every student has their own subject of confidence. Some student might have talent in mathematics, but the student might be poor in other subjects such as chemistry. In my case, I am confident with subjects of programming, but I am not good at chemistry. The system about learning all basic subjects might make student's grade lower.

   Finally, systems in School of Freshmen is not the only way to explore many majors. The main purpose of School of Freshmen is to explore many majors and to help students choose their major. However, studying all basic subject might make the students lose their interest. There are department briefing session which students can get information about the major. I think the department briefing session is more beneficial for students to choose their major.

   In conclusion, for these reasons, I think there are more disadvantages of system in School of Freshmen. So I would like to change the system about School of Freshmen. Having many department briefing sessions earlier might solve this problem."	5.0	4.5	4.0	13.5
1851	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" My parent didn't bought me smartphone because they thought it is not helpful for studying. And because of this I was able to commuicate for much time with my family and friends. Like my case, smartphone usually destroy communication among people. I will show three reasons and details about it.
 First of all, using smartphone takes too much time. When we want to be closer with someone, we need to spend much time with them. It will be same with family and friends. However, smartphone takes that time because it has many interesting contents. This will lead to lack of time to spend together and chance to make good memories.  So, communication will be reduced by lack of reletionship. 
 Second, it is too easy to communicate by using smartphone. Messingers or SNS are one of the most important part of smartphone. Most of people think there are only advantages like easy to use or doesn't need much time. However this advantages can give some bad effects to us. Have you ever seen phonecall phobia in news? I was very surprised when I saw that word. Many young people are having that phobia because they always use messingers to communicate with someone. Like this, too much using smartphone for communicate is bad for good communication. 
 Lastly, using smartphone can distribute our emotional ability. It is easy to meet very bad contents in smartphone. Their mind can be hurt when people watch then too much. It means their real lifes get effects by contents they watched. In addition, their social skills will be come worse because of using smartphone. Because using smartphone is one-side-communication. They don't need to see other people's face or behavier. Like these, smartphone make people hard to think about other people's emotion well in real world.  
 I have talked about three main idea that why the smartphone is bad for communication. To sum up, communicate with people face to face is the most important one. I hope that people commincate well and spend good time with their friends and family,"	4.0	4.0	3.0	11.0
1193	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of the COVID-19, distancing in society started since last winter, and it led to online spring and summer semester. From elementary schools to colleges, all schools delayed starting spring semester, and some colleges including KAIST still restricting face to face lectures in school. Instead of typical face to face lectures, online lectures became issue. Some of experts analyzed that colleges will keep online courses in post-COVID19. Why? The reason is clear advantages of taking online courses.
	First at all, online courses are more comfortable to do non-active lectures. Except some lectures which require a lot of activities, online lectures are easy to meet each other. Because students can join classes at home or dormitories, they donât have to prepare a backpack and hurry up to arrive before the class starts. That means online courses save studentsâ time. In addition, online lectures may increase communications between professors and students. Professors can see each studentâs name and face clearly in Zoom, so students feel more comfortable when professors call their name. Professors are also able to see all the students, there will be no student who doesnât get a chance to present or answer a question.
	Also, recorded videos of online courses are more efficient to study. Many students often sleep late because of lots of homework, so they are always tired. For these students, it is hard to concentrate for hours. They sometimes lose concentration and miss some important parts of a class. Then, in face to face lectures, students have to interrupt the flow of the lecture to ask a question, and professor should repeat the same part which other students already understood. This process usually repeats more than once in a class, and it is time waste. In the contrast, students can repeat the parts that they didnât understand in video lectures, and ask only useful questions in online meeting. That means students can solve light questions themselves, and professor should answer for only few hard questions. Saving time is a great advantage to both students and professors.
	In conclusion, with taking online courses, it is more comfortable to do lectures, and recorded videos are more efficient to study. Online lectures save studentsâ time, increase communications between professors and students, and make lectures more efficient."	5.0	4.5	4.5	14.0

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"People grow up from diverse environments, and consequently they have different thoughts and ideas about arguments. There have been massive and fierce controversies about whether computers are helpful for our lives or not. Certainly, various opinions may exist. One side argues that computers have made life more complex and stressful. This is contradicted by the claim that disadvantages of computers much less than the advantages of those. In addition, when the development cause easily and the society more complex, people should adapt and changed their movements and reactons. If they should not change their situation, they will dissapear in the progressive world. However, in my opinion, there is no little doubt that computers have made life easier and more convenient for the following reasons.
 To begin with, computers led a development of technolgy. This is because computer can make people deliver the infromation for other people much more easily. It is evedient that it is comfortable to get and give informations compared with the the past without computers. In the past, if people want to search data, they ask and direct experience. Nowdays, it is easy to get search and read paper in the internet. In addition, the developments of technology make our lives more easily and improve the various academic terms like science, math and art. 
 On the top of that, computers give a chance for education. In fact, Africa and asia childern are hard and dangerous to go school, and  they can not achive to study. However, the social company like world vision, and Unichef give them to study. The imbalance of education is not problems for developing country. It can also occur in Korea. In the spring, COVID-19 virus happen and many peole restrict to movements. Furthurmore, the children must stay in home and study using online school classes. 
 Finally, Youtube and Google have tremendous media and vedio to give indrect experience. For instance, People who want to go outside and go abroad experience activity in home. If people want to get informations, they just search on goole and learn how to do. Moreover if you want to watch past drama, it is easy to wach you tube.
 To sum up, Some people claim that compuer makes our more complex. It is evident that society more complex beccause of increasing entropy in the view of nature science. The developments of tecchonogy, broad chance to education and indirect experiences is possible due to computers. In this regard, I belive that the computers have made life easier and more convienient."	3.5	4.0	4.0	11.5
1902	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are many countries which I want to visit. But these days, visiting foreign countries is prohibited because of covid-19, so I couldn't visit a foreign country. If I have the opportunity to visit a foreign contry, I really want to visit U.S.A. There are several reason I want to visit there.
First, I have visited some foreign countries such as France, England, Italy, Germany, China, Taiwan, but I have never visited U.S.A. I want to go and see some famous landmarks in U.S.A. Two weeks are long time to travel a foreign country. There are many states in U.S.A and it is large to travel, so it is appropriate to visit for two weeks. And Temperature is one of the important condition to visit a foreign country. U.S.A's weather is similar with Korea, that is, U.S.A is not very hot or very cold so U.S.A is good to travel.
Second, I want to communicate with foreign people in English. I am not good at English speaking rather than reading or writing, listening. So I think visiting U.S.A can be great opportunity to develop my English speaking skills. Not only practicing English myself, but also talking with foreign people who use English would be very helpful to me. After I graduate the university, I want to study in a foreign country to get master or doctor degree. So increasing English speaking skills is necessary to me. 
Finally, I want to visit my friend's house. I have a friend who has lived in Los Angeles. He always said He will invite to his house when I visit U.S.A to me. So I promised that I will visit U.S.A later. If I visit U.S.A, I can meet my friend and I can sleep at my friend's house, then I can save some money. Also he can guide me to travel U.S.A because he knows U.S.A well.
In conclusion, I would like to visit U.S.A because I have never been to U.S.A and I want to communicate in English and I want to visit my friend's house. If the covid-19 disappears and I have the opportunity to visit other countries, I really want to go U.S.A. I hope I can visit U.S.A until next year."	4.0	4.0	3.0	11.0
328	Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Â 	"Despite a wide variety of interpretations and discussions, opinions about how computer changed our lives have not been narrowed down to one. Although some people think the computers have made our life more complex and stressful, I claim that computers have made life easier and more convenient.

Thanks to computers, we can use various data more easily. Computers has the large space to storage information, and it doesn't take to much space compare to the information in paper. if the computer had not been developed, people might have to work with the large amount of papers on the desk. Also, because the computer has better computation ability than people, we can assemble data fast and correctly to make the result that we want. 

Even in the case that computers are not used for the data work, computer made our lives more convenient. One example is the bank work. Through the past, until the computer has developed, people had to go to the bank themselves to save money, or send money, and etc. Because banks are the places that only run before the 6 p.m., going to the bank had made the schedule more complex. However, people can use the bank services by their own computer now. Therefore, people can modify their schedule more flexible.

These days, computer has been one of the must-have item and almost everyone has a personal computer now.  Although some people would feel stress due to the complex stages of the work made by the computers, it is obvious that computer has helped us working with data, and using time more efficiently."	3.5	4.0	4.0	11.5
103	Government: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.    	"Why Should Governments Spend More Money on Public Transportation

Until now, in Korea, many citizens use advanced public transportation anytime. Although many think that using public transportation is quite uncomfortable to transfer and physically hard, it has many individual and public advantages. In my opinion, governments should spend more money on improving public transportation for three reasons in different aspects: convenience, environment, and cost.
Nowadays, public transportation is widely used for a long distance like Seoul to Pusan. In this case, using public transportation is more convenient than cars, because people donât need to concentrate on their driving and ride comfort is not bad. For example, some college students like KAIST students use trains a lot to go dormitory. If parents drive Seoul to Daejeon with their car, parents will get tired after their driving. Rather than using a car, if students use express bus or train, they can save a time and feel more comfortable. 
Second, public transportation is more eco-friendly than cars. If all citizens use their individual cars every day, a lot of carbon dioxide occurs in the air. This carbon dioxide would cause green gases which increase the temperature globally. However, if all of them use subways at once, it could save the clean air from air pollution. Furthermore, some transportations work by electric energy, so they donât release any polluted gas. 
On the other hand, some argue that the public transportation is quite expensive. However, there are lots of events to discount the transportation expenses; for example, traveling with four friends in KTX can halve the KTX fee. Not only the transportations with a long distance, but also subways have some great discount system in Korea. If the user transfers to another subway track, it just cost a little additional pay to travel a long distance. Plus, car also pays a lot of money on oil charging, so using car is not much economically beneficial than public transportation.
In conclusion, spend more money on public transportation is much more beneficial than roads and highways. Some argue that it is financial damage, but its convenience, environmentally positive effect, and discount of cost cover all disadvantages with additional benefits. There will be more advanced public transportations created that many enjoy them to get in workplace or travel."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
1208	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of the covid19, lots of people who contains me can't go on a trip now. We can find the people who want to go travel easily. Then why lots of people want to go on a travel? There are several reasons of that.
The first reason is travel can make people refresh. From now on, people are too tired because of living in fast-changing city. Lots of people are working in the high building and sitting down in front of their computer to do their work for all day long. However, when they go on a trip, they can feel the nature. For example, I went travel to Seolak mountain. While walking in the mountain, I could feel the smell of forest. It makes me feel better.
The second reason is travel is the best way to study about culture of other countries. There are several ways to study culture of other countries. Reading books, watching movies.... But I think the best way is travel. Because when we travel, we can meet lots of people of that country. While talking with them, we can know about them exactly. For instance, what they eating, watching.... Also, we can visit the museum. In the museum, there are lots of things about that country. The museum shows me the history of that country. And most of pieces in the museum can make the foreign people feel wonderful. I heard that lots of foreign people who visited Korea say ""Gyeongbokgung is really beautiful castle!"". It can make good image of that country to foreign people.
The last reason is traveling can make people who went on a trip together more friendly. Most of people go on a trip with their close friend, family. However, even though they were really closed before start the trip, lots of people are fighting in travel place. It means that during traveling with other people has lots of hard things. But by the trip, they can understand each other more and know that they thought only themselves' convenience. I went on a trip in vacation with my friends. During the travel, there are lots of accidents so we were too tired, so we made a small fight with each other. But thinking about that fight later, all of us feel sorry to other people. So that travel made us more clever for understanding other people and getting really close friends.
Traveling can make people refresh, know other countries' culture, close friends. Even though traveling is tired, the happiness that traveling gives to the travelers is much bigger than tired. I hope to go on a trip soon, too."	5.0	4.5	4.0	13.5

2202	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"What I want to change most in my university, the chance of meeting many people
   After graduating the high school, most of students in Korea go to university to improve their abilities. Therefore, the mean of the university for them is as important as the high school, so there are lots of important things in university. I think it also takes me too. There are many important things in my university, but I also think some are weak compare to other universities. Among them, I strongly think the chance to meeting many people is poor than others. I want to change this, so I explain this for several reasons.
   First of all, the width of experience can be increasing. The experience of meeting many people means we can experience a lot of events. For example, when we enjoy the university festivals, not only our university's students come, but also many different kinds of people would join in. In addition to this example, there are lots of events that enable us to experience, but I think these are poor in our university.
  Secondly, we can meet the important people for our life by this. When students meet many different kinds of people, they can also meet some people who are perfectly suitable for them. For instance, when they are preparing a project with other university students, they can be good friends by working together. I also think this oppertunity is not enough than other universities.
  Lastly, students can enjoy their life of being university students. By meeting many other people, they can solve their stress, talk about their problems and playing games. There are lots of tired things to univerisity students, but they can relieve it by playing lots of things with others. Therefore, it is also a good point of when the chance of meeting many people is enough.
  Like this, there are lots of positive points when univerisity students meet many other people , but I think it is not enough to my university. Therefore, I want my university change it sequently."	4.5	4.5	4.0	13.0
1847	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"We have heard many issues about violent from kids. For example, a student in china stand up and rush to woman teacher. And shot a punch to her without any reasons. And some students shot a real gun in school. The bad environment they have lived in affect them to bad direction. And violent video game can be one of them, but many good people have been playing, too.  So, I'll tell you that  it's wrong with violent games to affect kids in a negative way.

First ,  Most of kids already know violent games are different with real world. If a kid is baby, it can be dangerous. But if we think about most of kids who can play the game themselves, they can accept it's just a game which can't be real in our world. Usually, most of parents say them that it's not good to play violent games for you. And there are many prevent educations about violent from games in school. When I was elementary school and middle school student, I had heard many educations about that with some real crime news from kids who attack by some violent games. So, if there was a kid who did crime, it would be concerned with the environment which the kid have lived in, and violent games are so little factor of them.


Second, they play violent games to delete thier stress.  In these days, kids are too hard to  live the current world. They have so much assignments and academy schedules. And they can't play freely in playground because of COVID-19. So, it's not good honestly, but it's true that game is the best way to delete their stress. As I mentioned in intro, many good people play violent games like GTA, TAKKEN. And many  people watch video which BJ streamers play GTA. It means that violent game already became famous game in the world, and many kids play that games, too. 


In conclusion, it's hard to say that violent video games affect kids in a negative way. Many kids already know violent games are different with real world and they play violent games for their stress. Of course, there can be some crimes from kids which is about violent game. But it'll be concermed with the environment which they have lived in.

397	University:Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Many people think that university students have to attend every lecture.  However, I disagree with the statement and there are several reasons for this. So now I explain the reasons why I think like this.

First, attendance can show conscientiousness. The purposes of universities are not only helping the students learn new knowledge but also giving the right direction and conscientiousness is one of the most important elements for success. So universities need to enhance conscientiousness of students and attendance is the good way to do it. Although some people might think that successful people just have  good intelligence, it is not true. Most successful people who I know are hard-workers. For example, Elon Musk who is CEO of Tesla has worked over 100 hours per week.

Second, attending lectures is also good for the growth of the study. They can meet many professors through participating classes and professors are very good expertise for their study. So they can give not only their knowledge for study but also tips for research. If there are not any rules for attendance, many students will be lazy and lose their chances for the growth of the research.

To sum up, university lectures can advance conscientiousness and students are able to improve their skills for study through the lectures. Therefore,  I strongly argue that students should attend classes. "	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

2045	Recommend a good place to spend the weekend with family/friends. Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Most people have busy time during weekday. Some should go to school, some should go to work. As a result, most people can't spend enough time with their friends or family. However in weekend people have more free time. Weekend is good chance to hang out with friends or family. I recommend to spend time in Jeju Island for two reasons. 
   Fisrt, there are many delicious foods in Jeju Island. In jeju island their are many famous local food. For example, black pork is very famous so most people who visited Jeju eat it.
As Jeju is island,  most sea food are delicious and fresh. Most people feel happiness when they eat delicious food so eating delicious is very good method to heal their tired body and mental. Moreover, if people eat food with friends or family they feel more delicious so people would feel happier when they visit with their friend or family.
   Second, there are many thing to look in Jeju Island. Jeju island is made by  volcano so there are many thing to look that is made by nature. For example, volcanic cave, Jusangjulli and Hanla mountain these are famous place that many people visit. When people see great nature people become calm and it isgood for their mental health. During weekday you might get lots of stress at their job or school. Also your family or friend would get stress. Jeju island is good place to get rid of stress by looking beautiful nature. 
In conclusion, most people would be tired at weekend because they had busy weekday. During weekend people should heal their body and mental. Jeju Island is perfect place for taking rest. If you visit with your friends or family you can feel more happy, So I recommed Jeju Island to spend weekend with family or friends."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

1770	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" There are many advantages to live in Korea. For example, there are good health insurance, broad and fast internet, simple and easy transport and so on. But, there are not only advantages in Korea. The country was grown up rapidly for a short while, so it has many problems, too. The most thing I want to change in this country is the education system. Korea's education system always emphasizes the grades. Especially, for the minors, that's not a good system. I think the grades are not the important criteria to judge the students. Adults should make other ways to judge them.
 The first reason that I want to change education system is the grades and scores just make students' psychological pressure. The educational system that encourages competition doesn't create a desire for students to study. It makes them tired and worried. In order to grow students' thoughts, it is not to put pressure on them, but to help them find what they want to do. There are many other things to do except studying. While they are minors, adults should give chances them to experience various things and help them find their ability.
 Second reason is the scores and grades is not same as the students' ability. When people go out to society, usually the leadership, insights and communication are more important than studying. The grades cannot judge the students' ability in society. They should learn how to live together, but the grades and scores make people to learn how to win.
 Lastly, not only study, but also activities are important for minors. Like other countries, they usually emphasize club activities. There are various clubs such as musical club, baseball club, cheerleading, and so on. But in Korea, realatively few types and activities in club. And Korea's education system doesn't emphasize the club activities and deals with additional activities. But, Korea should make more types of clubs and emphasize them. There are enough worth to do it. Because, not all the students should study and to be a doctor or engineer.
 For these reasons, I want to change the education system of Korea. Make more club activities and emphasize them, or change the judgement not the grades to judge students. I wish students to experience many things."	4.0	4.0	3.5	11.5

112	Government: Some people think that governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. Other people disagree and think that this money should be spent on more basic needs. Which of these opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Korea need money on developing computer technology

In these days, Korea has economical issue, that is, where should government use money. Some people say that money should be spent on basic needs because there are many people in Korea who cannot buy own home, eat food that they want. On the other hand, other people say that money should be spent on developing technology, especially computer technology. In my opinion, government should help developing computer technology instead improving basic needs for several reasons.
First of all, developing computer technology can make future lives more convenient. Nowadays, autonomous electronics are developing in many countries, since they are more convenient in several parts. For example, many companies are developing the autonomous vehicles, and other companies are developing smart television or robot that can help our living. Computer technology is strongly needed on these autonomous electronics; since autonomous electronics are moving by computer codes. As a result, spending money on computer technology have high probability to make future lives more convenient.
Next, South Korea's strength on international trade market is computer technology. Companies like Samsung or LG are in the first group of the electronics, which computer technology is strongly needed. If government does not spend money to computer technology, Samsung or LG can lose their power in the market. That can cause the weakness of the South Korea on international trade market.
Some arguments say that country can be more stable and stronger when its basic needs are enough. On the other hand, developing computer technology can make power in international market. Then country can get more money by selling computer technology; as a result, country can spend money on basic needs. This cycle will make country more stronger and economically better.
To sum up, government should spend money on developing computer technology for several reasons: making future lives more convenient, keeping strength on electronics market, making better cycle on the money in country. Spending money on computer technology cannot affect to people's lives instantly. However, people can live better in the future."	4.5	4.0	4.5	13.0
2166	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"One thing I want to change
     My university KAIST is known as a school which has a brilliant student and an academic system. In fact, most students in KAIST that are including me are satisfied with an overall life of the university. Most people may think that there are nothing for KAIST to change. However, as there are no perfect universities, I think that KAIST has one important thing to change. In my opinion, if I could change one important thing about KAIST, then I want to change things about the school cafeteria. There are three reasons why I hope to change the school cafeteria. First of all, the qualities of food are low. Of course, since the prices are not expensive, we have to consider the qualities in terms of prices. Despite the price, the tastes are not so good. For example, the fried food is too greasy, and for some cases, meals are not cooked well. Second, there are too many restaurants related to snacks, not meals. Most of the KAIST students live in dormitories, so they often eat lunch at a school cafeteria. However, there are a variety of cafeteria about salad, hamburger, or sandwiches. Foods of these stores are just simple snacks, so students who want to eat meal and to feel full should go to a specific cafeteria. Then the places are so crowded, and they have to be waiting for lunch for a long time. Third, the condition of school cafeteria is not clean as much. For example, when I ate lunch at a school cafeteria, the hair and some unsatisfied things are found. These things make students feel worse, and even cause them to have a stomachache. In conclusion, one crucial thing I want to change is about the cafeteria of KAIST because of low qualities, concentration of school cafeteria about meal, and the bad conditions. I think that it would be better if KAIST changes the overall cafeteria system."	5.0	5.0	4.5	14.5
351	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"The impact of the development of computers is one of the most controversial issues facing the world today. Some people claim that computers have made life complex and stressful. On the other hand, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient, because of information accessible through the internet, globalization.
 First of all, Some argue that countless information including private information is opened on the internet even though people want. On the other hand, information and knowledge in the various areas are accessible via the internet. In the past, information was exchanged by letters or face to face meeting. Furthermore, a lot of knowledge was learned from books. However, since the internet has developed in the world, people can easily ask about the recent situation of friends and families. Also, by sharing knowledge in the media, a lot of students can get opportunities for learning. Even though inevitable information can be opened, convenient accessibility of information via the internet give people more interactive relations and educational opportunities. 
 Next, computers have made the world globalized. Through the various interactions with other countries, people can get an interest in other countries' cultures. For example, BTS from South Korea could be famous all over the world since their music videos and performance videos are spread fast through SNS such as Twitter and YouTube. The development of computers made people interact and share their cultures with each other conveniently. As the result, globalization has been proceeding all over the world. 
 In conclusion, the development of computers brings positive effects such as the accessibility of information and globalization. As some say that computers have made life complex, if people struggle to use computers positive, we can solve many problems with computers ."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0

"If I have an opportunity to visit any foregin country for two weeks, then I will choose United States of America. There are several reasons for me to visit U.S.A.
The first reasons would be ths size of the country. It is the 3rd biggest country on Earth, which refers that there are a lot of things to look and many landmarks to visit. For example there are beautiful colledge campus such as Harvard, MIT, UCLA and others. Unlike Korean colledge campus, they have really large campus. Not only  they have large campus, they have buildings built that have been built centry ago. Also I want to visit many places in US such as wallstreet, LA, Hollywood and others. There are famous places in US ans two weeks will give me enough time to look around the country.
The second reason is research. Now I'm studing at Korea but, I want to study in US for the master degree. However living in different country is difficult. So I want to visit and have a look at the culture and the colledge. I will be able to judge if I can live in different country, different culture for years. And I am little worried about gun problem too. I hope I could be fine with this problem too.
The last reason is going to be visit my friend. I have several who is currently living in United States. Sadly I can only meet them on vacation when they come back to Korea. So I would like to visit them at there colledge and have fun with them.

1645	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  School cafeteria is very important part of the university. The reason is that almost all students and employees use the school cafeteria for their lunch and dinner. It should not be too expensive and it should use good ingredients. I think our cafeteria is doing well on this so a lot of KAIST students satisfy with our cafeteria. However, I want to change some part of our cafeteria if I can. 
  First of all, almost all cafeterias except for few cafeterias close on weekend. However, a lot of students stay at school on weekend. Therefore, students are not able to choose the menu at cafeteria. If they don't like the menu of cafeteria, they should go to the outside which is much far from dormitory compare to the cafeteria. It takes long time and it is expensive. For these reasons, I want the cafeteria to open on weekend.
  Second, For some dormitory, it is so far to go to the cafeteria. For instance, I live in Mir hall which is located in the west of the KAIST. Since there is a small mountain between our dormitory and cafeteria in west, I should walk for a long time to go there. If I go there by walk, it will take about 25 minutes to get there. Therefore, I want to make the path that takes shorter time to reach the cafeteria in west.
  In conclusion, If I could change one important thing about my university, I will change some part of our cafeteria. I will change the cafeteria to open in weekend and to make new path for the students who live in the dormitory that is far from cafeteria. If our cafeteria is changed to this way, I will be happy to go to the cafeteria in KAIST."	5.0	5.0	4.5	14.5

317	Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Â 	"In 21th century, a computer is treated as one of the most closest and helpful tools to people. Although it provides significant advantages for people, some people argue that their lives became complex and stressful while others like the benefits from its convenience. There are two different aspects of computers, and I still think that computers have made life easier and more convenient for following reasons.

First, people can save time by using computers because its speed of working is much faster than human. As a simple example, writing something on paper with a pencil is significantly slower than typing it with computers. As the purpose of the computers as a tool is to help people work more efficiently, it is true that using them can result convenience and time-saving. Moreover, computers are used in the area of making and moving robots which help people to do dangerous or repeated tasks such as cutting metals or coloring cars.

Next, using computers takes an advantage that people can work on-line. If people do not use the tool, they should complete some stressful tasks by themselves such as sending a mail through a post office and wait for a person who they want to meet until he or she has time; however, if they use a computer, they can send an e-mail or contact the person on-line. Furthermore, in the period of COVID-19, the computer gives people an on-line lecture. Because of the disease, people have to stay home and can not visit their schools for lectures. Many people considered about a way to give students a lecture, and by using computer, they can teach their school members on-line with some tools such as ZOOM. 

However, there is a controversy that a computer is hard to learn, and the hardness make people stressful. It is true that learning a computer is difficult because people have to memorize the location of alphabets in keyboards, how to send an e-mail with some contents. But, once they learned about basics of the computer, not the complex parts of it such as coding, the benefits from using it come more significant than difficulties in learning it. And, learning basics like typing, web-surfing is not really hard comparing to their worry.

To summarize, because of a function as a tool, a computer benefits people's lives in aspects of time-saving and providing on-line circumstances. Although some people worry about a difficulty in learning the computer, I think that computers have made people's lives easier and more convenient because good things from using it comes bigger than the difficulty."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0
1874	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"  What do you think the best part of going abroad for school/university is? Studying in foreign countries is dream of many students. Why do they want to go abroad? I think students want to study abroad because they can learn the country's language or culture efficiently and find more chances in larger countries. 
  First, students can learn different language, culture well by studying and interacting with natives. For example, to learn english efficiently, many Korean students decide to attend schools in english-using countries. As listening lectures in English and talking with native speakers frequently enhance own's Language skills, many students who want to use English well goes abroad. Additionally, the culture may be different. For some students who like experiencing other cultures, this can be an another huge reason to applying universities/schools in foreign countries. 
  Second, students can find more chances in foreign countries. Sometimes, there are way more chances in foreign countries if the students' home countries are less developed in education than the countries of universities/schools. For example, Imagine that a Korean student wants to study specific nano surface but associated studies are not active in Korea. Then this student may decide to attend university in USA where the study has been practiced actively. As the country is way bigger than Korea and way more people, there are  more things to select. The student may also be able to  have jobs related with the nano surface in USA because there are more demand than in Korea. Like this, there are more chances to get if you go abroad. 
  To sum up, I think students want to go abroad because they can improve 2nd language skills and experience culture, and get various chances. If you want to learn 2nd language well, how about studying abroad? "	4.5	4.0	4.0	12.5
2125	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, more and more schools or university start the online class because of COVID-19. As they do, most classes use online video lectures instead of live liectures in a traditional classroom. Some people think that it's not appropriate for students to study, so they say that original educational way should come back. However, online video lectures have more advantages than they think. I will introduce representative 3 advantages of online video lecture.
    First, video lecture can be used everywhen. As online video lecture is used, Both professors and students can get benefits. Professors don't have to go to classroom in time. They can upload video lectures or lecture note before class, and they can do other things like research in that time. Also, students can study anywhen. They watch the video lectures again and again and study with lecture notes professors uploaded when they want to. Then, they can do other things like part-time jobs. In shorts, professors and students can make their schedules more flexibly.
     Next, video lecture can be used everywhere. Originally, students have to a lot of books and things to write with, and they run from classrooms to other classrooms. However, online video lecture doesn't require them. They just keep their books in their room, and they open the books in the room when class starts. Also, they don't have to make schedule regard of paths because they are always in their room. In addition professors don't have to go to their classroom, but they can teach in their home with their kids.
     Finally, video lecture makes people close. Students who live in where is far from university can take class, and professors who live in other countries can make classes in their countries. Moreover, students can take classes of famous professors without going their classroom if they teaches in online video lectures. Consequently, students can get a better quality of education than before. Like these, through onlie video lectures, all students and professors can get closer and it leads to reduces gap between various universitis.
     To sum up, many university do online class, but some people have disagreement of it. However, video lectures have various advantages. Students and professors don't have the limits of time and place. Moreoever, it makes people closer, so reduces gaps betwenn them. In these reasons, online video lecture is good way to education, and we have to develop it more."	4.5	4.5	4.0	13.0
1703	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.Â 	" I think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends with four reasons. At first, we can talk with other people by smartphones easily, so we don't have to meet face-to-face. By developing the technology about internet communication, we can not only send the message by smartphones, but also send the image and give someone the gift through kakaotalk. Eventually, we can do everything which we can only do by meeting other people in the past in the cyberspace. Secondly, when we spend time with other people, the smartphone disturbs our communication. For example, you are having a time with your friends. Then, how often you check your smartphone? Maybe, most of you check SNS and send the message to another person very often during this time. That is because you enjoy using smartphone as much as talking with people. By doing this, you can't improve the relationship with person who is in front of you. Next, smartphones make some gap among different generation. Generally, young people use smartphone more than older. So, young people know more and more language which is used in the internet. This situation effects the communication among family. For instance, children often use internet language during communication with their parents. But parents can't understand what they say, so they don't want to take with each other. Finally, in the cyberspace, you cannot make the relationship deeply. Many people talk with people who they don't know actually and they can do behaviors like sending comments or pushing the ""like"" button about someone's letter, who are not close with them. This internet culture makes light relationship and people are hard to communicate about deep topic with their internet friends. To sum up, using smartphone give us negative effects about not only our communication, but also our relationship. So, we have to meet person in reality, and reduce the useless uses of smartphone.

499	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Wide Knowledge is Beneficial
Some people believe that universities should require students to specialize in one subject; however, other universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Although these two types of education seem to be helpful to students, I think students should take classes in various fields. There are three reasons for my opinion though there can be a different opinion.
      First of all, students can find their interests through taking many subjects because students actually donât know what they want to study. In KAIST, every freshman should take basic subjects in various areas such as physics, chemistry, and biology. Next year, students should select their major, so many students have one year to consider their interests and choose their future working industry. Furthermore, students can change their major when they are not first or second grades. College students are young, so they can receive chances to investigate many areas and find which area they want to be experts. 
      In addition, wide knowledge is good although that knowledge cannot be deep. One of my friend works at laboratory, and he always say that college students should take classes which are not their major. Because sometimes researcher does research by coming up with ideas which are not primarily related to his area. He is an electrical engineering researcher, but his research also uses biology. Generally, It is necessary to know more than one field if you want to success for your job.
      Though some people insist that to specialize in one subject is a college job, it can be achieved by taking many subjects in college. KAIST students would be experts in many ways, for example, they are researchers, business people, and even startup people. KAIST students can learn various subjects, but it does not mean that they cannot be a specialist in one area. In my case, as I was a freshman, I donât know what I want to be. I just took classes from more than 2 majors, and I changed my major twice. I satisfied my decision, and now I know what I want to be and which major I am engage in.
In conclusion, pros and cons exist between two types of college education. Students can get advantages through taking various subjects; for example, they can find their interests, get wide knowledge, and be a specialist who contains various understanding. Becoming a specialist needs high efforts, so students should take more than one majors and study many subjects."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0
593	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"In modern era, a crucial issue about  the cause of affecting positive/negative effect to young adults is discussed by many people. Some people believe that the family is the most important influence on young adults, while other people claim that friends are the most important influence on young adults. In this essay, I argue that the family is the most important influence on young adults for some reasons.

 First, family is the rest place of mind for many people.  In many times, people try to join the groups like friends(it is not exception), clubs, etc. in social networks. Many people want to make these relationships, and in lots of situation, they may get some stress from these situations. However, family is the only group that people join without some trying. It can make many people comfortable, and it can also decrease the stress from social relationships because of the reaction of blocking relationship from outside. Therefore, family can make the most important influence to many people.

 Second, family is the base of behavior for many people. For many people, the house and family is the base of many social or rest behavior. For example, many young adults sometimes play outside with friends, trip to out of local place, and etc., and they almost  think about the effect of family or house in the first of planning. It can be the clue to the opinion in this essay.

 Despite these specific logical  reasons for my opinion, some people still claim that friends make most important influence to young people because of the group that share most times to play with and the group that share their active or hobby. Although these reasons are also valid opinions, I still argue that the family is the most important influence to young adults because family also share their hobbies like ""family picnic"", and they are the main people to know many people's mind and pain.

 In conclusion, although friends is the important influence to young adults because of the group that share the most times to play with and the group that share their active and hobby, family is the main influence to young people because family is the rest place of mind and the base of behavior for many people. In addition, family also give great positive effect to study to many students in schools or universities. Then, how about to go to your family and explain about their positive effect with ""Thanks""?

497	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Specializing in One Subject
In university, students have chances to choose their classes for what they want to take. However, for their graduation, some universities have policy about additional requirement for taking classes. Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. In my opinion, specializing in one subject has several benefits.
First of all, by studying one subject deeply in several years, students can have expertise. Four years are considerably long period to learn something. The students who take one specific subject for four years would have deep knowledge about the subject; from basic to advanced. However, students who take several classes might have less deep knowledge about their major. 
In addition, students can practice to focus on one specific subject for several years. After graduating the university, students should get their job and most of them might work for more than decade. It means that they should work for one company in one field. People who are not familiar to work in one field can have difficulties maintaining their job and possibly try to find other jobs. However, those who are trained to work in a specific field for a long time can maintain their job for a long period. Students have a chance to train this ability in their universities. By specializing in one subject for more than four years, students can learn the attitude for long-run.
Some argue that, taking several subjects are helpful for students to increase variety of their knowledge. However, this is not what students should get in universities. Little knowledge in several subjects is actually not helpful for any of those fields. Universities are where students build their base in their major and get ready for the next level such as job or graduate school. With little knowledge in several subjects, students cannot go to the next level in any field.
To conclude, for expertise and training long term studying, specializing in one subject is better for students. It will help students to have robust basis for their major which can help them in further studying or job."	4.5	4.0	4.0	12.5
2249	If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"My university, KAIST, is one of the most attractive universities in Korea. KAIST has a lot of advantages; so many famous professors are in KAIST, devices and facilities in KAIST are brandnew, and students in KAIST can attend the course almost for free. Despite of these advantages, there is one important aspect about KAIST that I want to change. It is the forced use of English. there is three reasons why I want to change it.
  First, forcing students to use English when learning other subjects can lower the efficiency of learning. Students in universities begin to learn new subjects that they had not expericenced during high school, so they have to put more energy to understand the new concepts of subjects. However, If KAIST forces students to learn subjects with English, they have to put much more energy to study and it leads to lowered understanding of those subjects.
  Moreover, Forced use of English can undermine the quality of lectures of professors. I've attended lectures of Korean professors using English during this semester, and I had a hard time understanding some of Korean professors' lectures because of their inaccurate English speaking. I thought that it would be better If they used Korean when teaching their subjects. There is no doubt that they are perfect experts of their subjects, but forced use of English bothers their lectures.
  Lastly, English course existing in KAIST is not sufficient. If we want to use English fluently, we have to encounter English sentences and English conversation very frequently. Unfortunately, one English course in KAIST holds twice a week and it is NOT enough for students to get used to English.
  To sum up, forced use of English have three disadvantages; it lowers the efficiency of learning, undermines the quatlity of lectures, and English course is not sufficient. With these disadvantages, students may have a hard time studying in KAIST always."	5.0	4.0	4.0	13.0
2019	How do movies or TV influence peopleâs behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, there are lots of contents including movies or TV shows. From children to adults, people encounter with movie or TV, whether they want or not. Because of this, movies or TV can influence strongly to people's behavior. Now, I will write about how do movies or TV influence people's behavior.
To begin with, teenagers will be the biggest affected group of the society. Teenagers are young, so they don't have their own strong values. When they meet some provocative movies or videos, it can be a big event to their thoughts and change their values. 
Next, not only teenagers but adults can influenced by movies or TV. The thing which people watch can change people's mind and thoughts. Various videos can give new ideas to them, or make their own thoughts stronger. After that, people would talk about that impressive movies or TV. For instance, after someone watched TV, and had big difference of consideration, they would talk to other people, and that story will be conveyed to many people. Then, it can influence more people.
Finally, mass media can influence people most strongly. Journalism can strongly influence people's thinking, and make public opinion. When people watch the news that have biased view, people would think and talk like that biased way. Then, this biased thoughts would spread to various people, and be a public opinion.
In conclusion, movies or TV can influence to many people in society. People are social animal, so new idea or information can be conveyed from people to people. This is the biggest part why movies or TV are important and affect people. The news or idea will spread in to people's mind. "	4.0	3.5	3.5	11.0
1726	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  Today, almost everyone can access to the internet. We can see what other countries doing or how they live whenever we want. There are also a lot of reports or essays about them. These are, of course, good phenomena but they also brought the seed of conflict. As we now know how other countries live, people started to compare our own culture with others. Discussions have been made to rethink about our culture. Someone says we need to change, while others say that is our tradition. Because I am in the younger side, it is likely to support the changer's opinion. Among the things that we felt it needs to change, if I could change one thing, I want to change the strict atmosphere about age. We are going to see why with 3 reasons in this essay.

  First, overly-strict atmosphere about age abandons discussions. There are lots of situations that people need to talk and think a lot with all members of certain groups. But some old people or even some young people treat younger people as their opinions are nothing because they are young. They say this is our tradition. But no. Age doesn't determine the value of arguments. I could understand why those traditions were made, because like 5000 years ago the elder was those who had all knowledge. But it's 21st century. Everyone can access to all kinds of data. We need to change now.

  Second, those who aged without getting wise use this atmosphere to support their reckless opinions. There are so many people nowadays so some people might not have ability to think in a logical way. They should listen to other's opinions and practice to make opinions that make sense. But, this culture makes them to not to practice. It makes them to spit out their poor thoughts, and makes them think they are right because the listeners don't argue due to the age difference. This is one of the most terrible thing made by the culture.

  Lastly, this tradition makes people to obey to the older ones. Due to the culture, we have very strict ì ë°°-íë°° relation. I don't even know what we should call 'ì ë°°-íë°°' in English. Of course if someone's performance is superior, we would look up to him/her by our wills. But, in Korea, the elders, even they are just one year older, forces to look up to them. This is total non-sense. We need to break this culture as fast as we can.

  To sum up, if I could change one thing about my country, I would like to change the strict atmosphere about age. This atmosphere refuses any discussions between young and old. Second, those who are old use this culture to support their opinions. Lastly, this tradition makes people to look up to the older ones without logical reasons. Now, we're in 21st c"	4.5	4.0	3.5	12.0
1849	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"    Today, there is a debate about a topic 'Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way?'. Some people say that violent games are harmful for kids, while others say that it is not harmful. This paper argues that violent video games affect kids in a negative way for 3 reasons.

    First, kids can repeat behavior presented in a video game in reality. Because kids have undeveloped ability to judge, they can do things in the funny video game although they are violence.  So if they got used to violence in a game,  they also get used to violence in a reality. For example, they can beat other childrens' head  and say a name of offensive skill. 

    Second, wild images in the game affects kids mind in a negative way. Blood or deads are new experiences to growing kids and they can give mental shocks. They are far from reality, but childrens who playing violence games can recognize that they are common in the reality. For example, they can think stealing other's car is fine or using knifes to kill people is nice.

    Finally, kids can be addictive on a violence video game. It is not limited to violence video game, and kids can be addictive in any game. That fact is bad enough. But violence video game is more dangerous for reasons above. They can not separate a game and reality, and use violence in reality.

    In conclusion, violence video games affect kids in a negative way for these reasons. Kids can repeat behavior presented in a video game. Wild images in the game affects kids mind negatively. Kids can be addictive on a game. If you are parents, educate childrens who playing violence video games good values and difference between a game and reality. Then childrens are fine though they play it."	4.0	4.0	3.5	11.5
1657	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Do you know about all sites in Korea Academy Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)? Some students do not notice these so they have difficulty about adaptation to KAIST. Therefore, I think our university should make a Kakao KAIST that informs KAIST, such as events and sites.  
 The first function of the Kakao KAIST is explaining KAIST's events. There are many events in KAIST like the KAIST-POSTECH War or the Strawberry Festival. However, some KAIST students do not have a method for knowing its dates because there are no people who report them. Therefore, Kakao KAIST should have a function that informs the events of KAIST before these events begin.
 Kakao KAIST reports also sites of KAIST. KAIST has lots of sites, such as KLMS, mail, and portal sites. For example, some freshmen confuse about applying for their courses because they cannot adapt to many KAIST sites. In fact, some students do not notice portal sites of KAIST so they lose applying for their courses. Therefore, Kakao KAIST has to report KAIST sites for their freshmen.
 To sum up, KAIST has to make Kakao KAIST whose can explain the events and sites of KAIST to their students. Furthermore, they should add Kakao KAIST's URL in students' ID cards to report to students about many things about KAIST."	5.0	4.5	4.0	13.5
1921	In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Three Qualities of A Good Student
    Nowadays all of us know the importance of education. Beyond that, we should know How can we become  good students. Students are people who study. However, Can we say a person as a good student if he only study well? I don't think so. To become a good student, we should care more points. There are three qualities of a good friend.
    First of all, good students should try hard to reach their goal. There are teachers and parents who think student should study science, math, and English hard. However, these are just method to reach their goal. Not every student should study these. For example, if a student want to become soccer player, he should play soccer a lot. 
    Good students not only try hard to reach their goal, but also make good environment. Good students affect other student to try hard and good students communicate well with their teacher well and learn a lot. In Korea, there is a word ""geunmugjageug"". This means if a peoson closes to black thing, the person become black. People are affected by environment around them. So, good student should make good environment to reach their goal easily.
    Although good student make good environment, good student do many other activities. We don't know what will happen in the future. If a person try really hard to become a basketball player, but there is possibility that his height's growing is stop immedietly. Then what can he do? Good students should experience many other things and make 2nd choices. In addition, experiences in many topics can help a student to reach his goal. Nowadays, we cannot achieve great job without communicate people who are in other topic. various experiences will help communicating.
    In conclusion, Good students should try hard to reach their goal, make environment which help them, and do many other activities. It will be great if we use this information and become a good student."	4.0	3.5	3.5	11.0
572	Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details.	"  The question means to choose between using time to earn money or being with family. I would spend more time with family and friends rather than get more money with shorter time to spend with them. I propose that earning money is easier than get a belief to my people. There are some reasons why earn lower money is better.
  First, we can not buy 'time' by anything, even by the money. We can not know what will happen even in next second, which means we should spend time wisely at every moment. Earning money is very meaningful time as well as taking brake with people, however, I think taking a rest with my people would be better. Talking and sharing each others' story make the relationship harder.
   Moreover, just earning money can not express your mind to people. If you give only money to friends or families and do not spend time with them, the relationship would be hard to continue. What they want is 'time' to spend with, not just money. As time goes on, they will give up to spend time with you, which would make you alone. The money can not make the relationship.
  In addition, working long hours without taking enough rest would make you tired. It will make you just earn money without using it because you have no time. I think this is meanless, since the reason why you earn the money is to spend. Even though the money is lower, we can get time to use by doing a less work. Also, working too much can make your mental weaker. Since you are tired with a hard job, some little thing can make you feel upset or sad. It can lead to weaker relationship with your people, and the cycle goes on and on.
  This problem is depend on the thought about relationship and the money. People who think the money is better than the relationship with people will choose high-paying job which takes long time. On the other hand, people who think relationship more important like me will get lower-paying job, and take time with their people."	4.0	4.0	3.5	11.5
1185	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Including KAIST, almost colleges have non-face classes in spring semester. Today, I will tell you some reasons about the advantages of taking online courses. These reasons are related to my experience in KAIST.
	First of all, we can use time freely. The ability of understanding is different for everyone. For me, I usually cannot understand immediately after taking the class once. I repeat the whole class several times or some parts which I did not understand. In addition, we can easily regulate the time for watching lecture. In spring and summer semester, I usually woke up at 11:00 am. Then I watch the lecture after getting brunch. 
	Secondly, we can take class in our home with casual clothes. Letâs think if we have offline classes. We need lots of time for preparing. However, in online classes, we do not need time for preparing. Furthermore, we can choose place for studying not only home but also cafÃ©, library, and study room. I usually watch the lecture in cafÃ© because I concentrate well in there. Like this, we can take lecture wherever.
	To sum up, I give you some reasons of taking online class. Because of covid-19, we have to take online class whatever we like it or hate it. There are lots of advantages of online classes but I hope covid-19 getting decreased as soon as possible."	4.5	4.0	4.0	12.5
1579	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" If I can change the importatnt thing about my country it will be definitely the military duty. I think the military duty should be disappear for 3 reasons.
 First, nowadays, the tendency of war has changed. We just use the long-distance weapons, which are very powerfull and don't needed lots of soldiers to utilize it. This means we can fight with enemy with less number of soldiers. For example, when I was in the artillery only 5 to 6 soldiers needed to manage the one self-propelled gun. Compared with infantry company, number of people in one company are about 1/6. It shows us that we need less soldiers while our military technologies are developing.
 Also, it is too harsh to young man to spend about 18 month in military. Time is very precious to everyone. Although, we can do lots of things such as study, use self-phone ect. compared with the past. But, it is still very difficult to have their own time while they are in military. In my cases, I have to enter the office anytime when my bosses call me and ask to do something. Even though I was sleeping.
 Finally, the problem is because soldiers were not volunteered,  the efficiency of the soldiers working are not as good as their best performance. It is true someone have to protect our country. But it is not fair that soldiers work for the country only with the small money, under the 1million won. It is increasing, but still not enough to cheer up soldiers morale.
  So if I have chance to change something in my country, I will change military duty into volunteer, and give more money as much as public officials. It will approve the national defense power. "	4.5	4.0	3.5	12.0
1240	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" In this year, because of corona virus, we should take online courses without going to college. Many people think that there are few disadvantages when we take online class. However, we can also find advantages when we take online courses because of three reasons. we do not have to worry about missing something. In addition, we do not have to move to classroom, so we can save our time. We can also use time flexibly.
 Firstly, we do not have to think about missing something. If we should take class in the college, we should prepare books that need in the class. If we forget something, we cannot truly participate on the class. In my case, when I was eighteen, I forgot files that need in the class and this fault made my class' quality bad to me because I do not have files to understand teacher's lecture. Otherwise, when we take lectures in our home, we do not have to think about missing something that need in the class. If we do not have books beside us, we can find our shelves. 
 Secondly, we can save our time. When we take courses in the college, we have to go to the classroom. Even though there are rooms for students in the college, It takes times to go to classroom. And there are distance between classroom to other classroom. We can even miss the beginning part of lecture if the distance of classrooms is long. However, when we use online lecture, we do not have to think about times about moving to classrooms. We just click zoom address and take the class.
 Furthermore, students and professors can use time more flexible.  For example, there are classes using both video in KLMS and zoom. Professors can record videos when they want, and students can watch videos when they want. And if we have questions, we can ask them in zoom class. As we can know about this example, we can use time flexibly. 
 When we take online courses, we can have to worry about time and missing. For those reasons, there are advantages of taking online courses in college. "	4.5	4.0	4.5	13.0
452	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"As exam period comes, every place in KAIST such as cafes, librarys are full of students who study hard for exam. I am also the one of them, too. There are numerous types to study. Some students just read and memorize all stuffs, whereas some student write down the contents and share with their friends. There is also different preference  of the number of person study with. Some students prefer to study alone, whereas others prefers to study with a group of students. Personally, I prefer  group study than the study-alone. There are several reasons of the preference: Share the difficulty, be less tired, can concentrated more.


When we study for the exam, there are a lot of problems or concepts that we cannot understand for our own. If you study alone, maybe you will send E-mail to professor or teaching assistent. However, it tooks a lot of time for replying and hard to read because the answer is on text. If you have friends who study near you, you can just ask them and solve the problem. And when your friends asks you the concepts you already knows, you can also help them. Sometimes you will realize you don't know the concept exactly well. This will be helpful to you to know what you don't know yet and understand the concept perfect.  

The study for exam is inevitably the fighting against sleep. Most student sleep less than usual for study. If you study alone, there is no person to wake you up. And the circumstance around you might be very quiet, so maybe you feel more sleepy nad tired. When you are with your friends, they can wake you up when you are sleepy. And If you are not really able to concentrate on study, maybe take  a time of 10-15 minutes for fun with your friends and you can study with healthier mind.

 Some says study with lot of people make you cannot concentrate on study, because the place is too noisy and you will want to talk with your friends. Well, these are partially true, but mostly not. Study with your friends doesn't mean 'noisy'. You can go cafe or study room with your friends. At there, group of student can study as usual. If you have questions or if you cannot really concentrate on study then you can rest just quarter hour. You can study quiet enough with your friend. There is also research result that white noise sometimes more profitable for study. And when you are alone, there is no person when you are wasting your time. Your friends might catch you up just hanging around and make you study agiain. Sharing  study result or study hours also might help for your will for study.

These are three reasons of my preference to study with group of students . I can share the difficulty of studying to ask questions around me, I am less tired when I'm not alone, and I can concentrate more with my friends. There are no correct answers for studying, but it is true that your friends give you happiness and help during the exam period. When you are really depressed, friends might be like a vitamin. With your friends, you can study less harder, simultaneously can make unforgettable memories with them."	4.5	4.0	4.0	12.5
1647	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"    People say the freshman term in university is the most beutiful period in whole life. It is a time to meet new friends and study new things in new place. However, my freshman life was not so different with high school life. Of course, one of the reason is COVID-19 situation, but it is also critical reason that I did not participate in university life well. If I can change one thing during my university life, I want to go back to last year and participate almost every events and programs that I can do.
    First at all, I did not make many new friends while freshman period. Because of online lecture, I have no chance to meet other freshman on year. In addition, I try to join in two circle, in Korean 'Dong-a-ri', but both tries failed. Moreover, I did not participate in online festival well. During a freshman period, I communicated only with my friends who I already knew from highschool. Therefore, I felt that freshman in university is simmilar to high school life.
    Furthermore, I not used services that make study efficiently. I got low GPA in both semasters in freshman. I understand that its the most biggest reason is a lack of study time. However, not only the study time, but also my study style also wrong. There are many services and programs in KAIST to support study. For example, KASIT students can ask question about study to seniar and juniar by tutering system, or to proffeser by email directly. Sadly, I did not use those ways efficiently. I try to solve all problem and question by myself, without person who can check I was right or not. This study style makes me misunderstand the lecture, and make lecture more harder.
    To summerize, I missed and passed many chances that make me and my freshman life better. I realize it at winter vacation of freshman, and deeply regret it. Now, I finally join some dong-a-ri, and study with friends. The period that I was freshman never come back. However, it does not mean that I have no chance anymore. I trust that I can make more beutiful life than my freshman period."	4.0	5.0	4.0	13.0
556	You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Â 	"I think ""Having the university assign every freshman's roommate and giving students chance to choose their own roommate from second grade""  is the best way. 

 For the first reason, it is about the merit of ""Having the university assign every freshman's roommate"". Many freshman have difficulty on making friends at first time. So it would be better to match the students randomly so that they don't concern if they can't find their roommate. And this randomly matched roommate can be good friends for each other.

 For the second reason, it is about the advantage of ""Giving students chance to choose their own roommate from second grade"". The opportunity to select their own roommate is the reasonable right for the students. And I think sophomore is the proper period that student can use that right wisely because they adapted to the university and overall dormitory life.

 This is the way that KAIST actually assigns the room for the students. And I am really satisfied with this dormitory room assignment policy. However, I also heard about the friends' story that they had some trouble with randomly assigned roommates. But thanks to the dormitory policy and dormitory readers' help, he could solve that problem well.

 So I think ""Having the university assign every freshman's roommate and giving students chance to choose their own roommate from second grade"" is the best way that offsets both way's demerits and makes merits remain."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

1917	In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Many students may wonder if they are good students or not. And many people may had tried to be a good student in the class. Then, what is a good student? There are two main qualities of a good student.
     First of all, good students should have enthusiasm. Students can learn and memorize more knowledges when they study by themselves than when they are forced to study. However, without enthusiasm of learning, they just study because they have to study. This kind of study which have no purpose, is not helpful for students. Therefore, to be a good student, students should have passion for study.
     Not only passion, curiosity is also the quality for a good student. Students can develop themselves by asking questions that are related to the knowledge which they learned in the class. The origin of questions is curiosity. If students don't feel curious about the knowledge, his or her studying will be end just by understanding and memorizing it. However, if students finish studying with old knowledges that already written on the paper and do not create new ideas, the world can't be developed. The final purpose of studying is to make a new theory or technology based on old knowledges. Accordingly, curiosity is the important quality of a good student to think and create a new knowledge by asking a question.
     To summarize, the qualities of a good student are having enthusiasm of learing and having curiosity for what they learned. It is because, these two qualities help students to study by themselves and think creatively. It might be difficult to be a good student in a day, but if you try consistently to have a passion and feel curious in the class, then you can be a good student."	4.5	4.0	4.5	13.0
338	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"The debate over whether or not computers have made life easier and more convenient has become a great issue. Although some people might say that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I strongly believe that our life has become more convenient thanks to computer.
   First of all, computers can do so many things that humans can not even try. For example, computers are able to calculate about 10^12 times faster than human. Therefore, there are no need for people to spend countless times on our daily occurring calculations. Also, computers enabled us to storage thousands of documents, videos, recordings, and so on. Before computer was invented, only thing people could do to save their works was writing down on a piece of paper. But now, thanks to the enormous amount of computer's storage, people are able to maintain their results.
   Secondly, computers are the key factor of using internet. Nowadays, it is almost impossible to live without an internet. People use internet everywhere at anytime; order products from website, email each other, or use internet banking. Because of the development of computers, people could easily access to internet, which made our life much more convenient and easier.
   In conclusion, thanks to the computer's ability and access to internet, people's life become way better and easier than before. There could be some complexion or stress due to using computer  , but the benefits are beyond its negative effects."	3.5	4.0	4.0	11.5
2254	If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" My university, KAIST has various pros. Since it is one of the best universities in Korea, it has numerous excellent professors and convenient facilities. Also, the system that every freshman students have free-major is one of the best advantages of my university.   Some people believe that KAIST could be a leading school of technology because it has only engineering and science departments, and can focus on science and engineering. However, KAIST would become a better university if it has various departments other than science and engineering, because of following reasons.
 First, students can take various classes when there are many departments. There are various classes about engineering in KAIST, but there are not many classes about economy, languages, or social science. As a result, most of students fail to take the classes that they want.  Some people take season-semester because they failed to take the classes that are not related to their major. Also, students can get brilliant ideas while studying various fields. For example, students who are interested in industrial design could be inspired while taking class about art. Students in KAIST are missing the opportunities to have these ideas, because there are not various departments in the university. 
 Moreover, students are not able to meet different kinds of people in KAIST. Since most of students in KAIST are interested in science, it is difficult for them to meet people who are interested in other fields like social science, music or art. Meeting various people is important because it could be a nice experience to share ideas about their fields. This experience would be helpful while conducting research about their field. Also, we need various kinds of people to perform a big project. For instance, to make a smart phone, companies need electrical engineers, designers, and even marketer.  Students could learn how to communicate with different people if they can meet different kinds of people in university.
  Lastly,   careers of students can become broad. Some students who are not very interested in engineering or science might want to have other jobs rather than researchers. This students may want to become a musicians, or lawyers. However, KAIST cannot support these students because there are no departments about these jobs. Therefore, students can have more chances if there are more departments. Also, more academic clubs about various fields would be held, and students could have nice experiences about career that are not related to science or engineering.
 KAIST  is one of the best universities in engineering in Korea, but it would become a greater university if it has more different kinds of departments. These could make students that are not only good at science research, but also  researchers that can communicate with others well and lead the project.  "	4.0	3.5	3.5	11.0
2142	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"Nowdays, many students use their tablet or laptop computer in class. Of course, someone thinks using laptop in class makes students not concentrate to class. However, I think using laptop has more advantages than disadvanates.
 First, tablet and laptop are very convenient. Students do not have only one class for a day, so they need to carry many books, dictionary, notes, and so on. But tablet or laptop can contain these materials at once. Moreover, it is much easy to take and edit a note than real note. Because students don't have to carry such heavy things, they can more concentrate to class. Also, professors have a convenient tools to check the absence or assignment, and give a notice.
 Second, using tablet or laptop is more useful in society. After students in colleges graduate, most of them get a job. In their company, they mostly use computer to make documents or communicate. In addition, some jobs like programmers always use computer to work. Therefore, students have to know how to make documents file clearly or make a code in order to adapt their jobs easily.
Finally, tablet and laptop can use online class. In 2021, most of universes take online classes because of COVID-19. Even if some students can't resist near colleges, they can take a class because class and exam are taken in online. Taking exam or class without going classroom have many advantages. Students can take class everywhere and everywhen, so they can control their schedule more smoothly. 
 By these reasons, I agree with using tablet or laptop in class. tablet and laptop are very convenient to use, have to used in society, and are suitable for online class. I want more laptop-using class to be held."	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5
1777	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"During your life time, you might have some chance to change system or something else of your surrounding. It can be at your work, family, etc. Making some idea about it will be a nice work for your inhance.
Since I am spending amount of time in this university, KAIST, I will write about one important-changing-thing about this university. If I have chance to do, I would change the location of university. Some people might say that current location, Daejeon is proper. But my idea is about the specific one.

I think current location, ì´ìë, is too far from the main area of the city. For dinner or shopping outside, we have no choice but calling taxi to move to main area. It costs too much money for university students who cannot earn enough money for those things. if KAIST is nearby the center, students could walk around for those things.
Few disagreement may be caused by the reason of current location. Few decades ago, KAIST positioned here to make Daejeon as the center of science and technology. Following that idea, lots of Labs from government and companies locate near KAIST. It means if we just move only KAIST, communicating with those labs might be hard with the vision of pasts. However, advancement of communication technology could break those worry, so the problem might be nothing.
There is one more thing that my friend and I usually talk about. Every system and professors, even environments of KAIST is better than any other university in Korea except only one problem. As you can know, this is the problem about location, which is not in Seoul. Huge amount of infra are concentrated in Seoul, so it is prefered to go university in Seoul. But some problems related to money and laws stop to make new, or move university to Seoul. So moving KAIST near center of Daejeon such as near the train station can be the alternative answer.

Since problem of capital-concentration of Korea, not all problem of location can be solved with my idea. But with reasons above, I think moving near main area can be alternative answer to clear some issues. "	4.0	3.0	4.0	11.0
310	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"The objective of university education has changed centuries by centuries. It was an organization for research, the only source of breakthrough. Then companies with mass capital setup their own research facilities, leading new breakthroughs. Time by time, universities became concentrated at education more than research. Also the educational requirements of workplaces generally increased, several small universities were even considered as a place for job training. Nowadays, numbers of universities are facing new problems caused by upcoming changes in this rapid developing technology civilization. If they could not handle new requirements, they will not be able to evade termination. Universities must give students diversity in their subjects to flexibly deal with those problems.
 The first reason why universities should offer diverse subject's educations to the students is the rapid changing workplace. For example, product designers have to know what digital circuitry is needed to make sure the design with LEDs or digital interfaces can possibly operate. Even if they doesn't know deeply about electronics, at least they should know it's possible or not. Programmers working for web sites are required to have knowledge in art and design. Those requirements did not exist in last centuries, but it is becoming essential. 
 Even though, there are several opinions that diversity in educations lower the quality of itself. However, this is restricted on a specific portions of diverse jobs, such as researcher. In a situation that adapting to new job requirements is required, spending time on one subject causes the students to lose their possible chances for practical job educations. Also, most of the students enter universities without knowing what they really want to do. University is now treated as a place for finding job preferences.
 In conclusion, the change of workplaces require new workers armed with diverse knowledge. Universities should follow this trend to offer students new diverse educations that they need. Being specialized on a few subjects causes risk of loosing time for this era's students."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
1430	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"   The freshmen of KAIST expect the best campus life. Obiously, professors and classmates are among the best in the world. However, there is a flaw in KAIST's cmapus life. That is the dormitory communal toilets and shower booths. The problem has two negative aspect, so I choose this what i want to change.

   First, it has privacy problem. Though there are screens in the shower rooms, but there is no screen in changing room. So, freshmen are forced to show thier naked bodies to other people. Most people might feel ashamed of this situation. Especially, someone withe physical complex will be reluctatnt to take a shower.

   Second. the common toilets and shower booths have quarantine problems. Since Corona 19, quarantine has become very important. However, many people share a few toilet in common toilet, which can lead to hygiene problems. If one of the dormitory members gets infected withe Corona 19, it will be easy to become a mass infection through the bathroom.

   In conclussion, the toilet and shower booth have problems with collective hygiene as well as individual rights. To solve these, each room have to have a toilet. If that happens, satifaction of students with school life will increase."	4.5	4.0	4.0	12.5
723	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"Going on vacation and buying a car are both very good choice. But we can choose only one of them, so I would suggest to buy a car. There are three reasons why. 
 First, to buy a car will help saving money. Car can save lots of money. Imagine that we go for swim this vacation. We have to go all the way to the swimming pool or ocean world. If we ride a bus, it will cost about 10,000 won and if we ride a train, it will cost even more. And when we are living in dormitory, there are many chance for us to go out side of the school. And usually we use taxi. It cost some money too. Some people might say that car need money for keep it work, but using taxi and train that are used to move will obviously cost more money. 
 Secondly, to buy a car can make our life more comfortable. At midnight or at noon, there are no enough taxi to ride. I`ve waited for taxi about 30 minutes last Sunday. I was wasting my time. But if you have car, you can save all that times. That time can be small but if it combines, it will be big enough to do something. And also it is easier to go somewhere I want. Bus is cheaper than taxi but there are many places that there are no bus station near by or the bus comes once in an hour. But if you have your own car, it is not even a problem. Some people could say that go on vacation will give you wonderful memory and it is more worth it than just saving some time or money. But I think we can make memories in the future my using the money and time we saved by using car. And also you can go driving with your friends to make good memory and it can be made only if you have your own car. So I think buying car is better choice. 
 My third reason why is that car can help go on vacation. If you choose to buy a car, you can choose anywhere in Korea to go on a vacation. You can drive all the way there so you do not have to think about the bus time or train time and it will make your vacation plan to be more flexible. At last summer vacation, I went Jeju island with my friends. After we arrived at airport, there are only 5 minutes left to catch a bus. This fact made us to be hurry up and some of my friends lost the bus. They had to wait for about an hour for bus to come. We had a plan to go see ocean near airport but because of bus schedule, we could not go for it. There were several similar problems during the vacation. But if we had a car, our plans would go at least better, and we would enjoy the vacation better. However, some people will say if you use money to buy a car, you can enjoy better quality of vacation. That opinion is right in some part. But what will you do in the next vacation? It will cost more money than the vacation using car. It is hard to save money that much every vacation. So if you see longer, buying car is better choice. 
 To sum up, because of three reasons in the essay I will suggest to buy a car. Buying car can save money by not using taxi, bus and train. And also it will be more useful because it can help me to go somewhere that I want even though there are no bus station near by. And lastly it can help me to make good vacation. Cars will help our plans to be more flexible. We do not have to waste time by catching taxi or changing bus so the trip could be more like the plan we make before the trip. So I suggest buying car than going on vacation."	3.5	4.0	3.5	11.0
509	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"A Small Number of Students
Recently, the debate on the form of giving college education is rising. Some claim that every student should have the opportunity, on the other side, others declare that it should focus on the outstanding students. Despite the claims that a college or university education should be available to all students, it should be available only to good students. 
First of all, it is economically efficient to manage a small number of students. Financial support for college life is the surest way which helps students. Given that the expenditure on laptops and food is very high, it is natural that additional college financial support for students is made so that students can focus solely on learning. By considering the limited financing of school is distributed samely among the students, supporting a small number of students can provide sufficient or more support. 
In addition to economic efficiency, focusing on small numbers can cultivate elite leaders. The momentous person in the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution is a great leader, who leads the society. Usually, one of the factors related to the quality of learning is the number of students per professor. For example, in the case of general liberal arts lectures, as many as 300 students are taught by one professor; thus, the quality is naturally lower than that of one professor teaching to five students. Hence, teaching a small number of students, these situations will overlap, and in the end, individual students will have outstanding competencies.
Some argue that everyone has freedom of education, so they insist college or university education should be available to all students. It may be true that if no other form of education was considered. University is a place to create good talent, but it is not the only place to gain expert knowledge. Anyone can listen to public lectures such as K-mook, for example, and anyone with the will can obtain specialized knowledge of the university through educational services. 
To sum up, college education should be supported to a small number of talented students. This approach is more economically efficient than the way of educating everyone, and it can create strong talent. In addition to the university, there is also a window for the general public to listen to education, which prevents worry about when this method is implemented. Therefore, all university facilities will have to seriously consider the policy of raising a small number of elite students."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
1169	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Due to the world-wide COVID-19, many colleagues including KAIST teached their lectures online in this spring semester and it seems that a fall semester will probably be a online semester. Some people argue that such online course are worse than face-to-face course, but I think it has some advantages in terms of a study routine, time, and responsibility.
First of all, the online lecture system provides the students a chance to organize their own study routine. Unlike a normal semester, in which the schedules of each course are held, the students can make their study plan freely. They don't have to be disrupted by taking a lecture in a held time when they want to keep other studying. For example, when a student is planning to do a chemistry assingment throught a whole morning, the online lecture does not let calculus lecture in 10 AM ruin one's study routine for chemistry. A schedule which perfectly fits us can be real.
Secondly, the students can have more time compared with a normal semester. In the normal semester, every students has to go to campus and come backe home after taking face-to-face lectures. If one's house is far from the campus, one can not waste his/her time. In contrast, since the students can do everything which they noramlly do in a campus in home, they take advantages in terms of more abundant time. This time can be used for studying hard or lesuire time.
Lastly, the students can grow their own resonsibilty. As I mentioned above, in the online lecture system, we are totally free about our routine, study. It means that if we fail to control ourself, we can have the worst semester : just playing with no learing and bad grade. The students who realized this point can have a mind that their choice determine a result of semester, so it grows their own responsibility.
So far, I have talked about the advantages of taking online courses. I think a perfect study plan, more time, and growing one's responsibility are the advantages. All of university students in this year must use this freer semester effectively."	4.0	4.5	3.5	12.0
2086	Recommend a good place to spend the weekend with family/friends. Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Many people want to spend the time with family or friends to release the stress. There are a lot of place to go picnic such as mountains, valleys, rivers, and occeans. Especially the occean is one of the most popular places in summer.  Although some people say that occean is dnagerous and there is nothing to enjoy, I believe that occean is the most proper place to spend the weekend becauseof three reasons.
     First of all, the occeans are popular in summer. As I said in the above paragraph, many people go to occean in summer. Because of temperature, we can get stress a lot in summer, and we have to release the stress by get something cold. The occean is proper place to provide cold thing such as water. In my opinion, water of occeans is usually felt cool in summer because it is too hot outside a occean. In other words, the occean is most proper place to spend the time in summer.
     In addition to temperature, people can enjoy a lot of sports in the occean. People who go to occean used to play beach volleyball. To play beach volleyball, only the ball and net are needed, and the rule is also so simple that everyone can enjoy. There are also extreme sports in the occean such as surfing. People can get the feeling that surf the wave only in the occean. Therefore, the occean is useful place to play several sports.
     The occean can provid not only entertainment but also delicious seafoods. When people all enjoy the picnic in the occean, they may feel hungry, and find to restaurants to eat delicious foods. If there are no restaurants, they should spend many time to eat the foods. However, I remember that there are generally a lot of seafood restaurants near the occens. Because the source of seafoods are occeans, the restaurants near the occean can provide fresher seafood than another places.
     In conclusion, the occean is the best place to spend time with family or friends because of temperature, sports, and foods. If you want to go picnic with your family or friends, How about the occean?"	4.0	4.5	3.5	12.0
1370	In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details toÂ support your opinion.	"You get to meet a variety of types of people in your life. Some may just pass by you, while some may give a huge impact to you. A lot of people may be you friend. However, sometimes you will fight with friends. On the other hand, some might be quite best friend for your entire life. In my opinion, to be a good friend, you and your best friend both have to get good affect and give good influence.

First, mostly significantly, I think a good friend has to be similar in thinking ways and opinions. People get to grow up in tons of environment, and all have different thoughts. It is natural to have different opinions, but at least people having opposite perspectives may not be a good friend. It is so hard to understand a person who lived through a totally different environment. On the other hand, having a similar perspective leads to understanding each others feelings well, and this is very important. Laughing at the same situation makes you feel more happier, and being angry or sad at the same situation helps you to sooth your feelings. When you are in a bad situation, friends with same thinkings help you to get a better condition. For example, when I was in high school, a student did a mistake. My friend and I argued by saying that was a terrible thing, or just a mistake. This led me and my friend as a person and person not knowing each other.

Second, not envying each other is another quality to be a good friend. If one starts to envy, there is no end. It may be in any part, such as appearance, grades, one's environment, etc. Let's say that I envy my best friend. I keep get to ë¹êµ with my friend and when I am not better than her, I get to be low-mooded. Everytime I meet her I will be sad or bit angry at her. In the other hand, if I get to be slightly better than her, I will ë¬´ì my friend and she will also feel it. Once ether me or my friend starts envying, I think it is difficult to talk or see one another as before. We couldn't talk about what we accomplished, and then she or he will no more be a friend, just people in competition. 

Finally, in my opinion, a good friend could help each other when one is in bad situation, and not be friends just for use. A friend means someone who you can corporate. This does not mean only understanding and encouraging each others feelings in happy situations, but to help in bad situations. This can be something related to money, or questions when studying. In this point, a good friend has to give help when the other is in bad situation. In addition, you should not always just ask for help. Asking help in really hard situations(ë¶ê°í¼) and giving help makes a good friend. After getting help, you should be thankful too. 

My opinion of a good friend need three major qualities. A good friend has to have similar perspectives with me, should not envy each other, and help each other when one is in a bad situation. I hope you get a good friend qualified such as those reasons. It will make your life more happier."	3.5	4.0	3.0	10.5
1801	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"    Recently, thanks to the fast transportation and share of information due to the Internet, numerous students have studied abroad. Mainly, many students go to the US, UK, or some Western countries in Europe. Those countires have in common that have good facility and well-educated. I want to suggest that since students can have nice education, relationship with many different kinds of people, and availability of getting a job aborad.
    First, students can receive the best education. This is because thanks to the good facilities and well-educated professors, students can listen to much better lecture and get nice answer to their questions about their major. Moreover, students can get a chance to have native-speaker friend or attend foreign language lecture so that they can learn and increase language skill much faster.
    Second, they can communicate with diverse kinds of people. Since a school or an university can be a field of meeting from different countires, students can meet many people from the different culture. They can learn the other cultures or can teach them their culture. Besides, as there are some people who became successuful like CEO of a company or a professor. Since having connection with them can help them having jobs or doing several social activities, students hope to be one of the students in nice school.
    Last, it is much easier to get a job abroad. Like content I mentioned in the second paragraph, there is a social connection between university and numerous companies. Since friends in a company can give some tips about an interview or introduction, knowing an aquaintance or a friend in company is very helpful. Furthermore, although there are numerous intelligent people from the other countries, it is obvious that the comanies prefer people from the universities in their home country because they commonly much better to communicate and work with them.
    It is apparent that studying aboroad provides several benefits and experiences that help student to design their lives. I also want to study abroad and if you have a chance to attend school in another country, it will be marvelous to go there and experience numerous things."	4.0	4.0	3.5	11.5
98	Government: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.    	"Importance of Public Transportation

Governments can spend money for transportation. They can support infrastructure like roads and highways, or they can support public transportation like buses, trains, and subways. In my opinion, governments should improve public transportation for three main reasons.
First of all, public transportation makes less environmental pollution. Improving infrastructure causes increasing private transportation; therefore, harmful gas is increasing in air. This gas can make critical pollution to environment. On the other hand, increasing public transportation makes less harmful gas. It will be good for environment.
In addition to environment, public transportation is economical. One public transportation can transport lots of people. In this case, less amount of money should be needed to resolve traffic problem. Moreover, even though increasing roads or highways is hard to construct, public transportation can be easily increased. Thus, public transportation saves more money.
Some argue that improving infrastructure is efficient way to resolve traffic problem. They say increasing roads or highways makes much more traffic capacity. However, since territory is limited, improving infrastructure also has limit. Public transportation can be increased continuously without regarding limit of territory. That is, public transportation is efficient way to increase traffic capacity.
To sum up, public transportation has three strengths: environment, economics, and efficiency. Of course, governments should spend money on both infrastructure and public transportation. However, if governments' money is limited, improving public transportation should be a priority."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
1643	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"   KAIST is in Daejeon, not Seoul. Many students say, ""The only one drawback of KAIST is location."" Daejeon is also big city in Korea. But, compare to the university in Seoul, we do not have much opportunity of participation, such as Intern, cultural activity or education. So the one important thing to be changed is the location of my school.
        The first advantage is to increase opportunity of participation. In the perspective of career, most of companies are located in Seoul, and they offer several Intern activity or event for university students. If we were in Seoul, we would get less constraint of time and space. More students can get the more benefits. And there are the more opportunity of cultural activity like concert, exhibition and club activity. We can be more collaborated people.
        Second, there are more interaction with other university, so we can increase our network and meet various people. In KAIST, there are only science and engineering department. Although KAIST is the top university in the world, we might have narrow thought. If we were in Seoul, we can meet many students in other university and interact with them. So we can get more various thought and network. Also we can learn the other culture to increase our adoption in society.
        We can get more participation and interaction, if KAIST were in Seoul. I think KAIST in Seoul is the best university in Korea. Also, the students' talent will be increse than now. So if i get a chance to change one thing of our KAIST, i must change our loaction."	5.0	5.0	4.5	14.5

"If I can change something in our country, I'd like to modify education system. There are several things that I think that sould be changed. most of all, our education system is not made for thinking, but just learning. In my opinion, the reason why we learn is to make our own comprehensive problem solving method. and to do this, it's important to make a proper atmosphere, which the students can think their own way. but I'm not saying that just let them thinking with no regulation is good. definitely we have to set some kind of formulated route to lead students right way. but in our society, the route, which has been composed and modified for several decades, doesn't emphasize the importance of thinking, and push students to memorize imformation as much as possible. and there no way to use these kinds of knowledge properly, because thinking strategy is not yet constructed. so, it's essential to develop thinking strategy while learning things. and one of the good method is make students have continueous curiosity and teachers help to think it with various kinds of way.
In short, current education system, which have to be changed, doesn't promote active thinking, and it could make students lower their problem solving abilities."	3.0	3.5	4.0	10.5
330	Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Â 	"Nowadays, many people contend with each other about whether computers have made life more convenient or just stressful. Some people may assert that computers have made life more complex and streesful; however, I strongly believe that computers have improved the life more easier.
To begin with, computers help people by connecting all people to ubiquitous network. I think that computer is the first device for ubiquitous network, and it means that people not only can get various information such as a weather forecast immediately but also break the boundary between people in different places and time. People are connected with each other by the computer network; therefore, there is huge convenience for people who live in the modern society and the revolution of information because they can work together whenever they are, and wherever they are. For instance, people can do their work or study in the colleges because of the development of computers and ubiquitous network system, even in the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows that the value of information from computers is much higher than the stress caused by computers.
On top of that, people can alter their labor by computers and increase their work efficiency. Of course, some people can claim that computers will alter all humans because people do not have advantages in the workplace, and this is why people feel streesful on computers; nonetheless, I believe that people have to give their simple work to computers. It is well-known that computers are not good at some regions such as analyzing images, creating a new idea or emotional work. Not only these regions but also many parts of human work need people's creative brains, not just mathematical calculations. If people use computers only in hard work that cannot be done by people or takes too long time to finish, computers can help people and people can live more easier with their own jobs. This occurs in various parts such as the design, the research, and even the work at the factory now and almost people in that workplaces tend to recognize the need of computers.
To sum up, computers can provide ubiquitous network so people can work together whenever and wherever they are, and people can give some of their simple work to computers to increase the work efficiency. In this regard, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient. I think that there is no reason not to use computers if there are advantages from computers in appropriate parts."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

755	You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"How can we choose our dormitory roommates?

 In KAIST, the undergraduate students all have to enter their own dormitories during semester. Someone had already lived in dormitory in high school, but for all KAIST students have a chance to live in dormitory. If we would like to apply the dormitory, we first have to choose the building, and ""roommate"". If we're a freshman, we don't have to worry about this, because school assigned our roommates. On the other hand, we must choose our roommates if we are over second grades. And, there are some opinions about this case. In my opinion, I prefer choosing our roommates, and I suggest three reasons to support my thought.

 First, we can avoid an awkward mood with our roommates because we already knew them. Especially, if there is a best friend who graduated a same high school, then he can be a great candidate for our roommate. 
 Secondly, we can prevent the complaint due to a disagreement of life cycle pattern. For example, if we usually do our homework in late night and roommates sleep at midnight, then he would be interrupted on sleeping by us. This would make a small anger, which can be developed a big problem. However, if we choose our partners directly, we can investigate some careful habits of them. As a result, we won't have to the right to complain the dormitory about roommate, comparing to random assign.
 Lastly, we can reduce our time to think of our next roommates. If school always assigns our post-roommates, then we have to worry. We already spent our time solving several matters and adapting our new dormitory lives, but it has been reset and return to the starting point again. So, choosing our roommates can resolve this problem easily.
 Despite of this advantages, someone says that this solution also gives some bad effects, such as the reduction of  life's diversity in dormitory. But, we can solve this problem by policy in our dormitory, KAIST.

 In conclusion, I'd like to insist that it is better for us to choose our roommates directly, because we don't need to experience an awkward situation with our roommates, and we can save our time."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0
668	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"It is hard to think that  all people agree to the same idea about where success comes from. However, my stance is adamant. I belive that success in life comes from taking risks or chances rather than careful planing.

  To start with,  the world is changing continuosly that can not be predicted easily and the speed of change becomes faster and faster.  For example, EECS(electronic engineering and computer science) is one of the most famous fields in nowadyas. However, just before 10 years, no one knew that EECS becomes hot so much. This was possible due to much faster development of AI rather than people's prediction, and sudden pandemic situation lately. Many plans that might be prepared carefully became meaningless. Thus, careful planning is not suitable for rapid-changeble world, while taking risks or changes are more suitlble for the world. 

  Moreover, the human history have been proved taking risks or chances had made significant success. For instance, Light Brothers, pioneers of the invention of airplane, are famous for never-ending challenge to make an airplane fly with risks of dead. They could made a greatful success in human history since they had taken risks rather than planning careful planning. 
This is why many nation's goverment have made policies about venture-enterpises to seek siginificant developments, too.
 
  Ultimately, to prove our ability, we need opportunity to show, not just only careful planning. Thus, we need to seek  taking risks or chances to get enough opportunitues. To be specific, opportunities can be preparing big test such as Law-school, or applying to the school that we want. 

  To sum up with, I claims that success in life comes form taking risks or changes due to above 3 reasons, rapid-changable world, human history, and opportunities to show our ability. We should develop ourselves by taking risks and changes."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
1524	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" As I'm in double major course in Nuclear and Quantum Engineering department, I want to change everyone's mind about nuclear reactor. Although I know some people may have skeptistic opinion of this and I understand what they want to point out, I'll tell the reasons and safety of nuclear reactor.

 Before I start, I need to emphasize that nuclear reactor is not same with atomic bomb. 
Uranium in nuclear reactor cannot make blast itself but just heating the fuel rod. You may heard about Fukushima or Chernobyl accidents. Yes there were explosion but blast in Fukushima was due to just safety system which remove rooftop before Hydrogen gas concentration becomes critical and  design/operating failure in Chernobyl case. I'll not discuss too much detail about them since it may become too long, I just claim that it was accident due to human and for normal operating case, It is very hard to make accident especially in Pressurized Water Reactor which our country use. So we are safe now.

 Anyway, Nuclear reactor is economical. This is my first reason. One reactor provides us 1GW of electricity. Since I cannot open the other browser to check exact value of other type of generator, I'll just say this is tremensously powerful. And only small amount of Uranium needed for this. So we can make electricity with lower cost than diesel generator or something. When electricity becomes cheaper, the cost to make something or use something in factory or household becomes cheaper. Then Korea can be rich more. Just simple logic. You may mention that wind power and solar power does not consume fuel but land to place them is also cost. Furthermore, they are not developed enough to make same electricity with nuclear reactor. For 1GW, one third of Seoul is needed for wind power case.

 And again, we have technology that extract dangerous material and uranium in used fuel rod. Only government policy is matter to do this. We can safely dispose the High level waste in underground about 500m from ground, and They cannot escape from engineering barrier before the activity of waste is not considerable anymore. Technology is already there but USA worry about possibility that Korea makes atomic bombs. This is one and only reason that we cannot dispose or recycle our used fuel.

 Finally, because time is not enough, Nuclear reactor is safe and will be more in future. I already said about safety before start, Let me just introduce 4th generation nuclear reactor, which in progress to design. Philosophy about 4th generation nuclear reactor is for safety, economics and resistance to make nuclear weapon. For example, people in research are designing Thorium reactor which is perfectly safe from nuclear accident, or liquid metal coolant reactor which is also very safe. Our technology is developed more and more. Only matter is government policy and people's mind.

So I want to change people's mind about nuclear reactor for good. I want to discuss more but since time is not enough, I'll stop here.

651	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"During our life, we all have some chances such as chance to attend a lecture, and to enter a famous university. By taking the chance, we can change our life. By changing our life to a better way, we can achieve success. In the other hand, some people believe that success comes from careful planning but not from taking risks or chances. However, I strongly believe that we can success by taking risks or chances.
Firstly, we tend to overestimate risks than benefits from our actions, and think doing nothing is best choice. For example, even though risks from COVID 19 is bigger than risks from vaccination, people think doing nothing and being exposed to risks of COVID 19 is better. This is because people overestimate risks from their action than benefits from their action. If there are both risks and benefits come from some action, people just think about risks about the action, and they think doing nothing is better. This stops people from getting benefits by acting and makes people do nothing. By taking small risk, people can taste sweet fruit of challanging.
Secondly, everyone can make careful planning. If we think about normal people, definitely there will be more people that can make plans carefully than people that can take risks or chances. Thinking about successed people tells us that extraordinary people tend to make great achievement in their life, and live so called successful life. For instance, president Roh lived a very special life. He graduated comercial highschool, and he became president of Korea eventually. Regardless of his achievements as president of Korea, we all think he lived successful life. If we become extraordinary people by taking risks or chances, we can achieve great success in our life.
Lastly, every good things have bad things inside, and we call them risks.  For example, jogging is definitely good for our health, but is has risk of falling or car accident. There is nothing with only positive aspects. Everything in our life has both positive and negative aspects at the same time. So, if we try not to take any risks, there is nothing that we can do in our life. Taking risks is essential in our life, and we should know how to take risks.
To sum up, we should take chances or risks to success, and there are three reasons. We tend to overestimate risks from our action, we can become extraordinary people by taking risk, and everything in our life has risks and we have to take it. If we want to live successful life, we should know how to take risks with courage, which is the greatest aspect of human essense."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0
105	Government: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.    	"Various kinds of transporting facilities are helping our live: including facilities for a car, such as roads and highways, and a public transportation. Both transportations help our live in different way. However, if the government budget is limited, in my opinion, an investment in public transportation should be preceded. There are three reasons why government should spend money on improving the public transportation; reduce of transport congestion, less destruction of environment, and reduce of environmental pollution.
First of all, developing a public transportation reduces transport congestion. According to Kim, who researches about Korean transportation and transport congestion, using bus and underground reduces transport congestion more than 25%. We should consider the fact that the population density is exponentially increasing(Anderson), and capacitance of people in public transportation is much better than a car(Kim). Indeed, Following the researches about transportation and population, we can easily think that public transportation is better way in reducing transport congestion in high population density.
Second, developing public transportation makes less destruction of environment. Korea has a lot of mountains and the land is usually not flat enough to make highway(Lee). Therefore, environment such as mountains are easily destroyed to construct highways and road. In contrast, developing public transportation usually happens inside or near the city, so it derives to less destruction of environment. Accordingly, the animals live in that environment could be safer, too.
Apart from the advantages related with transportation, improving public transportation is better in protecting environment. Public transportation uses less energy than a car, and also emits less pollution maters than a car. If we consider the future transportation with less pollution, we should invest in public transportation than other ones.
To sum up, despite the convenience of a road and highways, we should develop a public transportation. It will be the way to reduce pollution, environment destruction, and also the congestion. At the end, the government should invest in public transpotation.

672	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"  As society develops and people's desire for success increases, many issues have become controversial, one of which is whether success comes from taking risks or not. A majority of the population insists that success comes from countless challenges and courage. Nevertheless, some others strongly deride the above position. Because they have different backgrounds, each person has such a variety of views. With the two sides expounded, I believe that success in life comes through numerous adventures. There are several bases for why I agree with this perception and I want to delve into some of the most significant ones here.

 One of the most attractive points is that there are many cases in which the product which was released with creative thoughts becomes very popular. The person who first made the product and introduced it to the market have had great wealth and honor. To illustrate this, there are some very persuasive examples. Microsoft founder Bill Gates developed innovative software that has never existed before and was able to earn great number of money. In addition, Tesla founder Elon Musk, who tried to invest in new businesses such as Space X is also gaining more wealth and honor.

 Another crucial element why I believe the contention is that we can get accomplishment whenever the task succeeds and grow further based on this accomplishment. It can be given a concrete example. Challenging and succeeding in a new task evokes a tremendous accomplishment. In particular, we can get more self-confidence when we accomplish the task that has higher risk. 

 Some people examine this issue from another angle. They claim that following a well-organized plan is more likely to succeed. The arguments may sound appealing, but subsequent deliberation makes it clear that is not what it seems. If we just follow the plan, we can't learn the experiences of failure. Many people find a way to succeed in failure. For example, if you have failed an experiment, you can find a better way of research and learn about the right research principles in the process of analyzing why you have failed the experiment. When these experiences are accumulated, you will eventually become a great researcher. 

 In support of the abovementioned substantiations, I firmly hold the stand point that success come from carrying out numerous risky tasks. By trying something new, we can make innovative inventions and we can learn experience of failure which are nourished and create a path to success. There is a saying that success is the mother of failure. I hope that many people will do risky things and experience failure, and continue to challenge themselves for a better life."	3.5	4.0	3.5	11.0
795	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	" There are many people who live a success life and a lot of people want to live like them.  So many people study and work hard to achieve success.  Then how can people achieve it? Some people say success in life comes from taking risks or chances, and others say that success results from careful planning. Both are not wrong, but the opinion that success comes from taking risks or chances is more appropriate.
  First, people can't do all plans in life. In life, there are many situations that people can't expect. Some people say that careful planning can make future life more clear and it allows people to know what to do. But it's wrong since life is always full of situations that we can't expect. Those situations can be their chances, or they can be risks. The people who overcome those risks and use chances well become successful people. Successful people  such as many enterprenuers, nation's presidents had many risks such as being fired in company or being arrested by police when they were younger. And they all tried to overcome those well. 
 Second, if people only focus on their plans, they do not react for important changes or innovation in society. People who like to make plans might not see important changes or innovation. Successful people always react those situations faster than other and make alternative ways. For example, LG didn't focus on smart phone and only make former type phones, but Samsung tried making smart phone. As a result, Samsung caught the chances and now Samsung is global smart phone company, but LG quit making smart phone. 
 In conclusion, taking risks or chances is more important than careful planning because no one can expect future and people can see world's innovation and changes more quickly. This does not mean that people should not plan. In fact, there should be some plans.  But instead of focusing on plans entirely, knowing that plans can always change and acting appropriately when risks and chances come are far more important. "	4.5	4.0	4.0	12.5
1753	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Is the Korean education really the best?

        Education is one of the things that Koreans are proud of. Itâs not surprising to hear that someone from South Korea won the gold medal from an international competition. And weâve taught that South Korea is one of the smartest countries on earth. But in reality, South Korea is not the best country when it comes to education, if you really think about what education is eventually for. For example, there is no Nobel laureate who won the Nobel prize for their academic achievement. This may imply that the education system of South Korea is not the best to grow researchers.
        First of all, the Korean education system focuses too much on problem solving. Rather than trying to understand fundamental concepts, Korean students spend most of their time solving problems. But this is not the best way for them to learn something. It might help them get good grades for exams in the future, but what they really have to do as a researcher is something creative. There would be nothing they can do if they were to asked to do something creative as a researcher. 
        In addition, a lot of students lose interest in studying after graduation from high school. A lot of people think that colleges are not a place to study but to enjoy their 20âs life. And since the students at colleges had studied very hard until they graduated from high school, the chances are that they face burnout right after they enter a college. There is no exam like Korean-SAT at college, for which they studied for the past 3 years in high school, so theyâre very likely to lose their motivations to study at college. The majority students study very hard in high school to get into a good uni, but thatâs not really what education is for.
        Moreover, all the students who get the best grades in high school end up becoming a doctor or a public officer who works for the government. This might help improve the medical system or the govenment of South Korea, but itâs too unbalanced in this country. In other countries, straight-A students in high school are very encouraged to do something they really want to do. But in South Korea, every straight-A student ends up going to a med school or becoming a public officer no matter what they are interested in. If those talented students did something in which they were really interested, South Korea would have become a lot more competitive country.
        To sum up, the education system is South Korea is not very efficient for students to become a researcher. This system is too much focused on problem solving, so they canât really do something creative in the future. Also, a lot of students stop studying hard after graduating from high school, becuase going to a good uni was their only reason for studying. Moreover, all the talented students in South Korea end up going to a med school or becoming a public officer. If they chose to do what they were interested in, South Korea would have become a lot more developed country. Education is the most important for the future of this country, and itâs our duty to make it better."	5.0	5.0	4.5	14.5
1330	In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details toÂ support your opinion.	"I have a lot of good friend. they are from same middle school, high school or Kaist. So, I think I know about the qualities of a good friend. They are three point to be good friend.

First, good friend have to be kind. This include a lot of meaning. Good friend has to be considerate of other people or me. It impresses me. And other people tell me that he is so good friend. he can be recognized from other people. For example, I have a friend that treat other people so rudely. he stole other people's things like money or valuable thing. Other people lose a lot of thing. they hate him. I think that is so bad attitude. I think good friend will be loved every people. But, my rude friend can't be love any people. So, good friend will be kind. I think this is one quality of a good friend.

Second,  good friend like me. I think good friends like each other. This is so important point. If attitude toward each other is to be different, they are not friend. It can't talk about 'good friend'. They are not friend. For example, I thought one people is so good friend. He is so kind and his hobby was so similar with me. I was so enjoy playing with him. So, I thought he is so good friend. But he didn't think I'm so good friend of him. I was not his friend. He talked a lot of my gossip to others. When I know that, He cut our relationship. I knew he don't think that I was friend. So, I think good friend like each other.

Last, good friend must help each other develop. This is so good friendship. If one friend only assist other friend, this is not good relation. Good friend help each other and develop together. For example, when I was middle school student. I want to go science high school. But, I didn't study science well and my friend didn't study math well. So, we help each other. I teach math to him and he teach science to me. Finally, my friend and I can go science high school. I think this is a good sample of good friends. 

This three reason is so important that I think. So, this is the qualities of a good friend. If, you memory this three qualities when you think you have a good friend. This will be help to you. "	4.0	4.0	3.0	11.0

" There are so many essential things that build the country. Government, Economy, Military and more things like that are such things. All of them seem to be working well, but if I have to choose just one flawed things, then I will pick the problem of military for two reasons.

 First, Only Men have duty for guarding country, and they do not get any reward for it. Age from 20 to 30, the gold period, is important and joyful for every men and women. However, all korean men have to spend one-to-five of their 20s time for the whole country. It is honor to save our family and citizens, but they cannot get any meaningful rewards for them. If I can chage the military system of my country, I will change it for men to get more meaningful rewards like extra points on the public exam.

 Second, some part of the life in the army are not follow human rights, and they are strictly prohibited to be spoken in society. There were so many cases including crime due to irregularities in the army. It can be so dangerous for irregularities like bullying in army, because one can handle really dangerous weapons in there. However, It still continues even nowadays, and I can hear some voices that complain about the irregularities from my friends who already get in to army. If I can re-rule the military of my country, I will clearly open it to society so one can watch what is going on the army right now.

 To summarize, I will change the military system of my country for reward system and irregularities. Solving these two problems will makes army happier and stronger."	3.5	4.0	3.0	10.5
567	You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Â 	"If there is no COVID 19 situation, almost all of the students may be in dormitory rooms in campus. When we have to go there, the most important thing that student concerns about is his or her roommate. Some of the students say that we need to choose our own roommate. However, in my opinion, It is better that the university assign a student to share a room.
           First, we can make a new friend. In many universities, especially in KAIST, around a thousand students newly come to the campus from different high schools. Some of them might do not have high school friends and do not know anyone before the class begins. In this situation, if the university makes them choose their roommate, they will become very hard to choose someone. If the university assign new person to them, however, they might be awkward at the first few days, but they do not need to worry about it. Furthermore, it is a good chance to make a new friend. 
           On top of that, we can avoid some problems which are caused by choosing roommate. In my experience, it is rare that someone has only one friend. Generally, the students play together with group, which is more than three people. For example, imagine that 3 people come to the same university and they are friend each other. When they have to choose their roommate, It is natural that they want to choose their group members. However, the dormitory rooms must be shared only by two. They get some problem here, but ultimately, this could not be happend if the university has assigned new student to each of them.
           To summarize, I think choosing our own dormitory roommate is a bad choice because we can miss a great chance to make new freinds and there might be a problem if we do so. I said about the problem when the number of friend group is odd, but still there can be many other problems. Since there are many advantages and disadvantages for each opinion, so we need to think about this topic in various aspects."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
660	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances and thereby earn great fortune or fame. Others may believe that success results from careful planning. I think that there is no right or wrong answer for this debate, but  it depends on one's own value. Let's find out what value I put more weigh on and why this type of strategy on life can achieve or protect my value. 
 I agree with the idea that success in life comes from careful planning. The reason I agree with that is because I put much more value on my family and people around me, not great fortune or fame. For two years after graduating high school, I have thought deeply about 'what my life strategy should be?'. By comparing two sides of strategy mentioned above and looking back my nature, I concluded that I'm a risk averse person and I want to live a life that can protect or help my family and people around me. In order to live like that, I thought I should reduce risks by planning carefully for two reasons. 
 First, by planning carefully and reducing risks, I can protect my family or people around me. Since taking risks or chances implies that I might earn great fortune or fame, but it also implies that I might be loose everything. If I want to live alone, I might have taken risks and done adventures. But I want to marry my girlfriend and have children. In that circumstances, if I loose everything, it doesn't only hurt or damage me, but also my family.  I don't think I can bear it. 
 Second, taking risks or chances may be better strategy to succeed in short run, but in the long run, it may not always hold true. Life already has lots of risks around us waiting for chances to hurt us. Even though we try really hard to avoid those risks, we may not avoid every risks. So I think that taking the fact that human life is full of dangers and very fragile, it is more wiser strategy to avoid risks than looking for risks.  
 In conclusion, I retrospected on me and life then concluded that I'm risk averse person and it may not be always better strategy to success to take risks. Since I put more value on people around me and I believe that life is already full of risks. 
Thus, to live a life that I want to pursue, I would choose to plan carefully and avoid risks.  "	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

I delighted in take this university in freshmen year and until now. However, I think there are rooms to improve for the better school. That is interconnection within students! In addition, there are few opportunities for meeting our friends because of COVID-19, so many students take difficulty in hanging on people in schools.  I think our university should provide opportunities or events for students to meet and close each other via online or offline. There are many benefits by increasing connections of our students.
             First of all, connection of students can create synergy. KAIST has many talented student, and just connecting them open other infinite possibilities. For example, we assume there are student in major computer science and another students in major business technology management. They can share acknowledge that they learned in their course, plan to start-up, or reinforcing understanding about certain subject through different access method. Such case can be occur in many diverse regions.
            In addition, students can take their rights by connecting each other. There are many student councils and organizations for students in KAIST. However, many students don't have interest in them. Actually, student council in 2021 have not constituted by students' vote, because we have any candidates. If student councils and organization work hard for students welfare and comfort, students can enjoy better campus.
            Finally, interconnection with foreign students can provide growth of each other. Korean and foreign students take advantage by communicating. They not only learn another language naturally but also expand aspect of seeing world. Now there are some programs for communicating such as buddy, language exchange programs, but I think programs should be larger and available for much. This must be very excellent opportunity for both Korean and foreign students.
         In conclusion, I think our university should increase opportunities, programs, or events for students' communication. That can create synergy, increase students' welfare and right, and expand aspect of seeing the whole global world. "	5.0	5.0	4.0	14.0
329	Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Â 	"Since computers were invented, there have been arguments about whether computers make life easier and more convenient, and even now, they make controversy. There are two main perspectives. One is that computers make life easier and more convenient, and the other is that computers have made life more complex and stressful because they made people work outside the workspaces and cause various of diseases especially for eyes. Though, second perspective is lso persuasive, I think computers have made easier and more convinient because they offer a lot of softwares that can entertain people, improve the productivity of people, and connect people to people.
 First, computers have improved our productivity in workspaces. Before the computers have invented, when people want to get statistical informations, they needed to calculate and compare all the values they got from their investigation. In contrast, after the invention of the computers and development of spreadsheet office program, all the statistical analysis have been able to do with just some mouse clicks and draggings. Therefore, people have advanced the ability to use bigger size of datasets which are more meaningful than small datasets an improved work efficiency. 
 Second, computers have connected people more closely. After the invention of computers and distrbution of internet services, various types of online communications have been created. These new communication tools have different characteristics to other communication methods like phone call and SMS(small size message of mobile phone), for example, Facebook, one of the most popular SNS nowadays, have a simple-blog like form of communication. When people want to share somthing, then people write and upload a short post with pictures. And then other people who have access permission to that post can read it and write comments. That's how people communicate through Facebook and it is unpresented way of communication before. Through various form of communication that computer offer, people have been able to share more about themselves to other people, people have got closed each other.
 In other perspective, computers make people stressful by let people work outside the workspace. However, the stress from work is not from the computers, it's from the work. Before the invention of the computers, people didn't work outside workspaces, however, they worked for more than 20 hours, in 19C. Because of the improved productivity by computer, people can go back to their home, not always work in workspaces, so working outside workspaces cannot be the bad effect of computers, reversely, it's an evidence of more comfortable life than past by computer.
 The computers offer people productivity-improving tools and connect people. Although the computers also make people work outside the workspaces more frequently, the inconvinience and time-wasting caused when the computers are not present are much bigger than that bad effect. In conclusion, the computers have made life more convinient and easier than before through improving productivity and connecting people more closely."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
956	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"All-rounder students


     There is an interesting proverb; âYou should dig a single hole.â It means that students should be specialized in only one subject because they can fail to accomplish anything if they try to study various subjects.  In my opinion, however, it is too old proverb to apply for contemporary society and students should learn wide range subjects.
     The first reason is that most of projects in nowadays requires fusion of different subjects. For example, scientist makes new material by imitating a tissue of organisms. It requires both biology and chemical engineering. For this project, scientists should know about small parts of both subjects at least even though they are not an expert of the other subjects. If students study only one subject, they cannot process these projects.
     The second reason is that it is hard to be specialized in one subject well if students do not know about others. Many high-end technologies are developed by cooperation of scientists specialized in various parts. Therefore, it is hard to understand anything in a frontier of every subjects unless they know about wide range subjects.
     Some people say that taking classes in many subjects is not effective because it requires too much time and money. However, it is not a serious problem to stop to teach various subjects. Students can learn a lot of knowledges and techniques, so they can be more experienced and used in various tasks. The time and money to teach them are not a waste, but an investment to get a greater result.
     In conclusion, it is a best way to makes students take classes in many subjects. Even though it was better to teach only one subject because it was not effective due to the high cost and time consume, in nowadays, it is much better to teach various subjects due to the change of the society and effectivity of this typeof education."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0
402	University:Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"An attendance is the topic that always is talked among university students. Some students say the attendance should be checked in class, and other some say the attendance is unnecessary for university classes. Both of them have rational reason for their claims, and I also agree and understand with both of them. However, I'm agreeing with the attendance is not mandatory a little bit more.

 First of all, an attendance check doesn't consider any environment of all students. Unlike high schools and prior schools, there is a possibility that students live where is a far from the university. This means, some students have to spend more time to come school. For specific example, I'm living in Daejeon, but not in dormitory in KAIST. Before COVID-19 pandemic, going to the class took about 30 minutes, and it was hard to attend a class in a time. In addition, COVID-19's untact situation also made a new problem. Students who couldn't enter Korea and live in their country in different time zone, the attendance check is huge problem. Actually I met a student who have to wake up in 5AM to attend a class.

 Next, the attendance check requires few minutes during the class. During 4 years in KAIST, I experienced some classes' attendance check consume a lot of times, and it leads poor quality of lecture or late in next class. Though this Advanced English Writing class only have about 20 students, but some major classes have more than 200 people in class. In this situation, being optional of attendance must be helpful for both lecturers and students.

 Finally, attending class can be substituted with other methods something like assignments. One of objectives of checking attendance is to encourage students to participate to class and make them study without miss, but these can be checked by other methods. Debating is good option to make students participate, and homework can be also great choice to encourage students study. Thus, there is no reason to check attendance because its objectives can be achieved in other methods.

 With 3 reasons I wrote, I think optional attendance have some advantages than mandatory attendance. The most important reason I think is that all of student must be considered, and schools have to do their best to accomplish equality of students."	3.5	4.0	4.0	11.5
2039	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowdays, lots of colleges are providing online courses to students because of COVID-19. Everything is going uncommon in pandemic, and online lectures are new phenomenon. Then what can be the advantages of taking online courses? 
To begin with, the biggest thing is that students can be safe from pandemic. Everything is going uncommon in pandemic, and also education. Maybe online classes can make students depressed and unwilling, but the important thing is that students can be safe from pandemic. If colleges provided same courses with before pandemic, virus would go around between students.
Next, students can save moving time between lectures. There are lots of colleges that have large campus. For instance, KAIST campus is large enough to spend time moving from class to class. In online classes, students can save moving time, and they can use it to study more, going work out, etc. Many students would feel that they are using time much successfully.
To sum, online courses came out because of pandemic, but there are advantages of it. Students can be safe from virus, and they can save moving times. However, there exists also disadvantages like quality issues, and hard to make friends etc. Maybe we can find some middle point that can take advantages from both online and offline courses."	3.0	3.5	4.0	10.5
110	Government: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.    	"Most of family has one car at least. Also, most of people use public transportation everyday. Some people feel that the roads and highways should be improved; however, others feel that there should be more public transportation. In my opinion, governments have to spend more money on improving roads and highways. There are several reasons why road development is a priority.
First of all, there are many roads which have to be improved. For example, at the country, some roads are too narrow that two cars can barely pass by. In addition, some roads are too bumpy; therefore, they can damage to cars. Also, some highways are old and damaged. They need to be check and repaired to prevent accidents.
In addition to some old roads, some other roads are difficult to pass due to heavy traffic. The main streets of the big city are heavily congested with traffic for an hour at the rush hour. If the roads are expanded or new roads are built, this problem will be solved. Moreover, the situation on the highway is more serious during the national holidays. Since many people drive to their hometowns, highways should be more developed.
Some argue that more public transportation is needed. That is true, but the roads should be ready before that. If there are more buses on the current roads, it will be more inefficient and slower than the original. Also, some people do not use public transportation, but there is no one who does not use the roads; therefore, the development of roads should be prioritized. The development of public transportation is possible only when roads are wide and more.
To sum up, the government should pay more attention to the development of roads and highways. For this reason, the first is that many roads are now old and require maintenance, and secondly, some roads are complicated. The development of roads is very necessary for people to pass more comfortably and smoothly."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
1595	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I want to change is education system. There had been many changes in education these days. But I donât think they are  good change. Because they do not change fundamental education. In many Asian countries, especially Korea, educations focus on going to university. Students study Korean, English, math, science to go to university, not for their knowledge or personal interest. Unless students are not interested in these parts, they are useless. Graduating middle school is duty in law. But high school and university is not. If someone donât study in highschool, it is not illegal. Thatâs OK. But In our society, it is treated as illegal. People who dontâ go to highschool or university get penalties in many part of society. How wierd it is? Not illegal things are treated as illegal things. It is big problem. We should solve this problem. How? Changing fundamental education system! What I want to says is not a small change in some part of math, English, etc. What we need is fundamental change. 
First, in highschool, we should not push students to university. But, for many people, studying in university is not necessary. If someone wants to be a writer, reading many books,  watching movies or just think a lot can be better. For photographers, traveling around the world would be better. There are many ways to study about their job or life. University is just one way of studying, not only way of studying. So we should find many ways for students to achieve their goals.
Second, we should teach many useful knowledges for students. The world is changing faster and fater. But education is stopped. If you looke some picture of school in 1980s, you would know that school didnât change a lot. Itâs almost same! These education is too old. We should teach students how fast our society is changing. What is AI, how to use programing language, how to predict future are good examples. There are so many things to know, but these education system donât teach them. We should change this.
Third, we should make them happy. You know that Korean suicide raking is 1st in OECD cointry. Many highschool students are not happy. They wake up early and go to school. They study and study until 10pm at school. Itâs not the end. They go to study cafe to study more until midnight. They are always tested. If their grade is poor,  they blamed. They study 3 years like this way. How they could happy? But some countries, students are happy. They study what they want to learn. They do not concern with grades. They just study to upgrade themselves! It is real education. Studying a lot and go to good university is not real edution. It makes students just like studying robot. We should find a way to make students study happily. 
As we know, changing fundamental education need many efforts. I think changing education system has many conflicts. But we should do that. Students who got good education will grow up and will make better society. For future, education changing is what we really need."	3.5	4.5	2.5	10.5

472	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"At examination period, students study hard to get good grade.  Some students prefer to study with club members and some use study group to get infromation about test. In my case, I prefer to study alone. Thus, I will talk you why I prefer to study alone.  
     First of all, I want to study at silent space. If I study at a noisy situation, I can't focus on studying. For example, there are a lot of people that do something such as drinking coffee or talking with their friends. All the noise in the cafe will be bothering me. Therefore, It cause very low efficiency of studying. Thus, I won't be able to finish my all works.    
     Next, It is better to read a book than to  share opinions. Opinions of friends may not be accurate. For example, If I study alone, I try to check my book to find concept that I was confused or  I can't be memorable. This method is clear, so  there is no need to worry about certainty.
     Last, It helps to save time. When time is running out, we don't have time such as moving other place. If I do study group, I have to ready my part and explain it to others. Therefore, study alone helps to save time. 
     To sum up, I explain why study alone is better. Because of slient and queit situation, we can focus on something well. And It also help to get accurate information by using book directly. As the exam period approaches, the effect will increase. "	3.5	4.0	4.0	11.5
2206	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  Bus is good traffic method. But there are little bus station in my university. I think we need more bus station and being short between each bus time in university.   
  The first reason is that subway station is too far from university. Subway is another great traffic method that people usually use. But, the nearest subway station, Weolpyeong station is too far from my university. It takes more than 40 minutes by walking. It's very long time to office people and university student. To use subway more easier, we need more bus to go subway station. If there are more bus than now and being short between each bus time, then we can use less time that we use for moving. 
  The second reason is that there are no restaurant near from school. Of course, there are some restaurant in school, but students did't go to school restaurant sometimes. So, I will talk except school restaurant. Especially, when lunch time or dinner time become nearly, there are no taxi in school. There are no restaurant that are near from university. It takes more than 20 minutes by walking. More bus and short between bus time can make that students eat lunch and dinner outside from university in short time.  
  Bus is cheaper than other traffic method is the last reason. Bus is useful for university students who are not easy to earn money. Another traffic method such as taxi is too expensive to move far. For example, if I have only two thousands won and I should go to other position that is far from my university. Then, I can't use any other traffic method except bus. So, bus is best traffic method for university students. So, students need more bus station and being short between each bus time for easier to use bus. 
  In conclusion, there are three reasons why students need more bus station and being short between each bus time in university. Those were distance to substation from university, no restaurant near from school and cheaper than other traffic method. For busy university student, university try to make more bus station in university and become short between each bus time"	5.0	4.5	4.0	13.5
532	Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Â 	"During free time, somebody loves to spend his time with a large group of friends because it is more enjoyable when he stay with a large number of people. However, I prefer spending my time with only few friends. There are three reasons why I prefer spending time with only one or two friends.

First of all, I am an introvert. People with this personality prefer to stay alone rather than staying with a large group of people. I feel more comfortable to spend my time alone or with only one or two close friends because we are close enough to understand each other without explaining too much. I also found it more relax and peaceful to stay with as small number of people as possible.

Furthermore, I feel exhausted when I have to be among a large number of people because I lose my energy to this environment. I have to pretend to be kind and nice to each person which is very uncomfortable to me. Sometimes, I also have to pretend to enjoy some group activities even if I did not enjoy those situations.

Finally, the activities I would like to do in my free time are more suitable for small groups of people. For example, I like reading books in coffee shop, and this hobby does not need a large number of people. On the other hand, I don't like activities that require a large group of people such as team sports and party.

To summarize, I prefer spending my time with one or two close friends rather than staying with a large group of people because of my personality type and my hobby preference. For these reasons, I feel more comfortable and less exhausted when I stay with a small number of people."	3.0	4.0	4.0	11.0
2269	If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" My country, 'Korea', is small, but very strong country. We have developed lots of skills like making a boat or cellphone or e.t.c. However, this is all in our country. We do not have large lands or lots of oils. This made me to wish to have a bigger country. Bigger country can give us more population, more natural resources, and cheaper houses. So, if I could change one important aspect about my country, then I will change the size of my country. 
 First, bigger size allow us to have more population. As we have larger land, we can make more crops and meats to eat. This make us to make more babies. The more babies we make, the more citizens we get. As this situation repeats, then we will have more workers to work and lots of elites to make our country better. For example, China has larger lands and they also have lots of workers and elites, and this made them to develop easily.
 Second, we can have more natural resources. Resources like coals, oils are essential in our lifes. But, we do not have enough resources in our country, so we should trade it from other countries. This costs  a lot. So, if we have bigger size, then we can have more resources and it we have plenty of them, we can even sell to other countries. This will give us lots of profits. For example, countries like Iran, Irac and e.t.c. earn lots of money buy selling oils. 
 Third, house and land prices will be cheaper. In Korea, there are lots of issues about price of houses. It is too expensive to buy. It is because we do not have plenty of lands. As we can see in United States, they have much cheaper lands. So, if we have bigger size, we can easily buy houses. Because of cheaper lands, there will be lesser apartments and we could have a nicer house.
 Because, we can have more population which can be our power, profits from more natural resources and easier chances to buy our own houses, I think I will change the size of our country."	4.0	3.5	3.5	11.0
1187	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"   Recently, because of the COVID-19, most of the universities continue the lectures by using online meeting programs. Offline courses are difficult to proceed that there are many problems. Students who live in abroad are not easily come to Korea, and government want students not to gather in one area. Some people think that take the offline courses is the better, but I support the online courses for three main reasons of them.
     First, online courses allow students to increase the academic achievements. Most of the lectures are proceeding in online, so they can utilize the information more easily. Although lectures are started, students can press the stop button and find the information about the lecture. Another reason why students can achieve their academic achievements is save the money. Students donât have to find a room near the college. Also, there are no transportation costs or cost for restaurants by living at home. Therefore, students can focus on their studies more easily.
     Second, students can participate in online courses at any conditions. In offline class, students should take the lectures at the same time and place every week. However, online class allow them to take the lecture in anytime. For example, students can take the recorded lecture at the late of night or evening. Therefore, student who wants to wake up late in the morning have no problem to study. Also, they can change the life patterns which is fit for themselves. Similarly, students can take the lectures anywhere. For instance, they see the recorded lecture in cafÃ© or their home, so they can utilize the time more fluently.
     Third, professors can prepare the lectures more efficiently. In offline class, professors have several classes with the same contents. In contrast, online courses allow them to teach only one time. By recording the lecture and uploading at every classes which have the same contents, professors donât need to prepare the lecture twice. Therefore, they utilize the time which is saved by online courses with prepare the more information about lectures or research about their major interests. Then popularity of universities will increase soon.
     In conclusion, I support the online classes for three main reasons. Even though some people think offline lectures are better to communicate or take the lecture, I think online courses also have no problem to proceed the studies. I recommend you check the advantages of online courses and participate actively in online courses."	5.0	5.0	4.0	14.0
862	University:Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. Others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.	"University Education For Everyone

     Today, most students study hard and prepare SAT to enter the better university. High-level university guarantees students get preferred jobs such as doctors or judges. For these reasons, some say a college education should be available to all students for equity; however, others did not think like that. Due to the purpose and efficiency of university education, higher education should be available only to good students for several reasons.
     First of all, the major purpose of university education is training students to become good researchers. To achieve this goal, students should learn more knowledge during their class time; however, if there are not-well-educated students, professors should spend much time to explain background knowledge to understand them. For example, teaching plus and minus operators to students in an advanced calculus class is very inefficient. The class requires high background knowledge level.
     In addition to the purpose of training researchers, a university education is efficient in the small-size class. For example, in Advanced English Writing class, the English class in KAIST, professors can give feedbacks to each student for their writing because the size of the class is small. If there are 200 students in each sections, it will be hard to give individual feedbacks. Because the number of professors is limited, forming university to public education system like high school is impossible. Therefore, only the good students should study in the university.
     Some argue that high tution fees of university makes poor students to enter there. They think university should be available for everyone to teach them. However, there are already scholarship system in many universities; therefore, well-educated students can get university education although they are poor. 
     To sum up, admission limitation of the university education has many positive effect. Students can learn complex knowledge with good students and study efficiently with small-size class. That is the reason why the university education is available only to good students."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

477	University: Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Education Opportunity

     Education is important because it helps people in changing their behavior and their way of thinking. Since ancient times, education was an essential base for having or initiating a developed and improved civilization. However, nowadays, several people think that the opportunity of higher education should be given to good students, who do well in certain studies, only, and in my opinion, in this life, everyone deserves to have such an opportunity for several reasons.
     First of all, some people argue that letting average-skilled people to take courses in a higher level of education is waste of money and time; in addition, they think that focusing on only good students will allow professors to explain contents fast and well, and that kind of action may lead to a rapid increase in studentsâ performance and participation. Their plan is creating a society where above the average students lead or control average or below the average students in every work field. 
     Giving the opportunity of education to only a certain group of people is indeed a wrong decision because since old times, people aim and pay efforts endlessly to have a stable society where everyone stays on the same level and has the same opportunity of living. Such a decision will only bring harm to this world, and it may increase the number of crimes in several regions of nations. 
     In addition, that kind of decision faces a disagreement from many sides because the only way to improve a certain society is to increase the number of learners. Having more students is sure a good sign for creating new paths in learning and teaching as well; moreover, being good in school doesnât mean doing well in college or university. Some people may do bad in their period of studying in high schools, but they show an increase in their performance once they enter the university. 
     To conclude, every student deserves to have the same opportunity of education as everyone else. Some people think that giving such an opportunity to a certain group of people will save money and time but unfortunately, it goes the opposite way. The more students you have in your country, the more improvements your country will approach to, and encouraging people to study or continue their studies is the base for such improvements.

1711	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.Â 	" These days, almost every person uses smartphone for convenience. With smartphones, we can do almost everything all by ourselves. Since we can do most of things all by ourselves, some people say smartphones have destroyed communication among close people like family and friends. But I  don't think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends. Rather, it increases communication for several reasons.
 First, by allowing communication between people physically distant, smartphone helped us to stay  connected.  In the case of my family, a year before, I was in the high school which is far from home, and my brother was in the military. As COVID-19 was so severe, my family couldn't meet each other often. So, we usually communicated using smartphones' functions. As we can see in this example, smartphone helped my family to communicate.
 Second, informations we earned from smartphone can be sources of  communication. If family members or friends have same hobby/interest on something, if one gets a new information about it, it can be a initiating source. For example, if someone find out news about a singer, he/she would definitely tell another person who also likes that singer. These days, as main media where we look up news is  smartphone, smartphone helps us to communicate more with close people.
 Lastly, smartphones sometime offer a chance to communicate old friends or family members. As we grow up, there were many friends who went through our life. Some of them moved their house, and some of them went to different school. Just a decades ago, it was a tough thing to find old friends. But these days, as there are many social networking services operating, they sometimes offer us our old friends. Similarly, we can easily communicate cousins who can't meet often by using smartphones. With the help of smartphones, we become able to communicate our friends. So, smartphones help us to communicate our friends.
 Obviously, there can be families/friends that smartphones destroyed their communications. But, as smartphones help people to communicate with physically distant people, offer new sources for communication, and help to find and communicate with our old friends, they increase communication among family and friends."	4.5	4.0	4.5	13.0
1424	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"          KAIST is one of the best university in Korea. There are so many wonderful things, clever students and nice professors. Most student in Korea think KAIST is perpect university and they have no problem. But, I think there are several problems(or disadvantages) in KAIST. I think the most problem in KAIST is 'Essential subject' such as 'General Biology', 'General Physics 1' and 'General Chemistry'. So, if I could change only one thing about my university, I would remove 'Essentail subjects' for these two reaseons.

          First, many student don't have to know about some subject which is in 'Essentail subjects'. For example, students whose major is Physics don't have to know general biology because they never use biological knowledge in Physics. Forcing to participate all of the 'Essentail subjects' can make student tired. Even if, they might lose interest about thier major. According to a statistics(survey) which is made by 'Isang', KAIST Freshman student government, most KAIST student hate this system because they think it makes them tired and wastes their time to study thier major subject. Since they never use the knowledge in 'Essential subjects', they think it wastes their time.

          Second, it makes hard to graduate KAIST. Since we must complete all of the essential subjects to graduate KAIST, some student can't graduate even they satisfied all of the graduate condition except 'Essential subjects'. It is a very huge problem. Some student says ""I complete all of the condition to graduate, but I can't graduate in this semester because I can't participate 'Calculus 2' in this semester"". KAIST give more opportunity to particitate 'Essential subject' lectures to freshman students. So, It is hard to participate the lecture class for 4th grade students who want to graduate. Since KAIST have so many essential subjects, this problem is very huge problem.

          To summarize, essential subject system wastes students time to study their major subjects, and makes more hard to graduate, I think this system must be change. To decrease essential subjects or remove this system, we can solve this problem. So, for these reasons, if I can change only one thing in KAIST, I will fix this system. It makes student more easy to study their major and graduate."	4.5	4.0	3.5	12.0
476	University: Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"All Students Should Be able to Learn
A college or university education is important to society and students. Although some people believe that a college or university education should be available only good students, the higher education should be available to all students. Two reasons support this argument: opportunities to learn of students, and potential of students.
     First of all, society should give opportunities to learn to students. Learning is very important to everybody, but the opportunities to learn have been restricted to someone who does not show great grade. However, it should be changed because students still have right to study what they want and avoid discrimination by grade. 
     In addition to opportunities to learn, students have potential. As all people know, people show great power on site what they love. Students will have a big potential in major what they have interest, so they could be a great people on their major part if they can take higher education on their interesting major. Students who learn more about what they want will positively affect to society. 
     Some argue that it is effective to select students and focus on them for society. However, that argue has a big problem; grade don not say everything about students; for example, there are students who show the best performance on the university even though they were not exceptional students in high school. High school grades may say ability of taking a grade, but it can not say everything about students.
     To sum, Students should be able to get higher education. They have right to learn what they want, and that right will give positive effect to society. Society should go to direction where all people are encouraged to learn what they want."	4.0	4.0	3.5	11.5
453	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I really studied a lot until now. When I was young, to achieve my goals, I should study. Therefore someone would want to study with other people or alone. It will different because the habbit of someone to study is differerent. In my case, I love to study alone. I want to explain that reason.
 I am a student who have a mojor in biology department. To get a good score in biology department, I must memorize many things. When I was a second grade students, my final test range was ppt 1500 pages. It was very terrible. Anyway, I should memorize all of that. There are no other ways. Also, when we took the test, we should solve the problem alone. We can not debate with other students and see the other books or ppts. That is to say, I had to memorize all of things which I learned in my self. So, there are no reasons to study with other students. A group of students could not help me. To memorize all of things, I should study alone and fine the best way to memorize alone.
 Second, studying with a group of students interfere me. During the test period. My pattern changed enormously. Every day I slept only four hours a day and the time to sleep was changed. Therefore, sometimes I had a lunch at 3pm and I had a dinner at 4am. I guess the reason that my pattern was changed is that I focused on the study, I didn't have the time to take a dinner or lunch. However, if I studied with a group of students, I would take a lunch with that students and I would lost the chance that I could concentrate well. Also, if I studied with group of students, I would chat with those students. It is not helpful to me.
 I tried many ways to memorize all of things which I learned. Sometimes, I studied with my friends. But it never helped me, it interfered my study and take away my time. In the past, some friends asked me that study with my friends and take questions each other. It could be helpful if I checked the things that I memorized. However, there are too many things I should memorize. Studying alone is the best way and efficient method to me."	4.5	4.5	4.0	13.0
442	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Study is one of the most important things to do for all people. However, it is not fun and interesting for anytime despite it is quite important for our life. Therefore, many people suggest various studying type to make more concentration and efficiency. Among them, there are two main types of people either prefer studying alone or together. I think each of them have several persuasive reasons why we have to study alone/together, but I think studying alone is much better. There are three main reasons why I prefer to study alone.
First of all, studying with other people can easily break concentration. Concentration is one of the most important factor for good study efficiency. Some opponent argue that group study also make students to concentrate for their study, but I think it is not. If group members become more friendly, it can easily interrupt concentration for all members in the group. For example, they can go out for eat or just chtter with each others in study time. However, if we study alone, we can completely elimminate these obstacle for study. Then, student can improve their concentration and it will be directly related their grades.
In addition, studying alone have better time efficiency too. Students in usual group study have to prepare their materials to share with their group members. Moreover, they need to devide each part of study and need to prepare presentation. Group members also need to set a proper meeting time and they have to move for meeting place.  These process need much more time than studying alone. Time is very important thing for student, but it is a waste of time. If student study alone, he/she can utilize that free time for more study or break. Student don't have to consider nice visualization of their study and move.
The last supporting reason is study style. As I mentioned before, there are tons of study styles in the world, so each student have different study type with regard to their characteristic and ability. However, if student study together even they have different proper study style, group study could make bad effect to every students in group. For example, if someone prefer to study with discussion and talk but others just want to share their study materials, they can be a obstacle for each others. On the other hand, if student study alone, student do not need to consider others study style. Also, student can try many other kind of study styles in their own time without other's effects. I think it is more helpful for student to find their study style.
In conclusion, I think students can get so many advantages by studying alone. They can make more concentration and save time. Also, student can freely try other changes for study style. Of course, there are more advantages about studying alone, but most important thing for study is motivation. Motivation is much important for student regardless of study style. I hope many students improve their grade with my suggestions."	5.0	5.0	3.5	13.5
911	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"The More the Better

     In university, students should take many classes. Some universities require them to take courses in many subjects, and other universities require them to specialize in only one subject. Some people may think that students should take classes in one subject. However, in my opinion, there are several benefits for students to take classes in many subjects.
     First of all, students can find what they are interested in. Most students may not know about what they prefer and what they want to do in the future. By taking courses in many subjects, they can identify the subject that they are interested in. It is helpful to university students who cannot decide their future career yet.
     In addition, students can gain a wide range of knowledge. Clearly, students can obtain knowledge about various subjects by taking classes in many subjects. This broad range of knowledge may help students in their major subject; for example, in physics and chemistry, some concepts such as orbital are closely related, but the details are slightly different. Thus, they can better understand each subject.
     As mentioned, some people may feel that it is better for students to focus on one subject. They argue that concentrating on only one subject gives students deep knowledge; however, it narrows the perspective of students. If students have knowledge about only one subject, they can only see everything through it.
     To sum up, taking classes in various subjects has many advantages. It can help students to find their future jobs, and it can broaden their knowledge. Therefore, students should take and attend many courses in various subjects."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0
171	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Â 	" Taking classes in many subject and specializing in single subject are both great options. However, if I really had to make a choice between two options, I would prefer the latter, which is taking classes in specialized single subject. There are three reasons for this idea.
 First of all, classes in specialized one subject is helpful for students' career. In many cases, jobs usually require deep knowledge, not wide knowledge. For instance, even if doctor knows wide range of knowledge, doctor without deep knowledge of biology and medical skills cannot be a good doctor. Maybe someone said that wide range of knowledge can help us sometimes, but we should remember that deep knowledge, not wide knowledge is base for every jobs. Of course, universities' education that based on one specialized subject will help students build base for future career.
 In addition to this, make student to take classes in many subject can be detrimental. If student have to take classes in many subject, he should take not only classes in subject that he likes to learn, but also classes in subject that he dislikes to learn. Forcing student to take classes in subject that he dislike can make student to lose his passion for learning new things. In worst case, losing passion for learning new things can caused to passion for his major too. As we can see from this example, make students to specialize in one subject could be better option.
 Finally, learn deeply in one subject can offer power to challenge other subjects. Personally, in my case, I can learn different computer language such as C and Java well after I learn much about python, which is programming language that easier to learn. As example shows, deep knowledge in one specific area can help to understand other topics in different area too. Also, It can give us passion to challenge new topics in different major. So, I think that specializing in one subject is the first step for student to learn things in many subjects.
 For these reasons, I think that specializing in one subject is much better than take classes in many subjects."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
468	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Everybody has their own way of studying. Some people prefer to study alone while other people prefer to study with a group of students. Students who prefer the group studing say they can be motivated by their group members and can use a large seminar room. Despite these advantages, I prefer to study alone for some reasons.
 First,  students who prefer a group studying think that the group members can motivate them to study hard. It is partially true, but I think it doesn't make sense for all cases. It is because this also means we can be easily unmotivated by other group members. For example, other group member might tell us to go out while we are studying. Moreover, when we study with others, it is easy to be disturbed by their noise. In addition, to study with a group of students, we should meet at specific time. However, the group members are not always available, so  it is hard to meet to study together. Therefore, we cannot use our time fluently. However, in case of studying alone, we can concentrate our own work without disturbance and can use our time more fluently. 
 Second, some people prefer to study with a group of students since they can use the school seminar room which needs 4 people to make reservation. However, this also means that it is hard for group to find a suitable studying place. In fact, it is hard to seat together with a group in library. In many cases, they have to be split. Or, they have to move another place to have a seat. In other words, studying with a group of students have some space limitation. However, when we study alone, we don't need to worry about to get a seat in library. It is more easier to get one seat in library.
 In conclusion, for me, studying alone is better than studying with a group of students. It is because studying alone allow us to study without interrupt with others. In addition, studying alone make us to use our time more efficiently and has less space limitation compare with studying with a group. "	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
823	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Newspapers tends to show challenge backgrounds when they introduce some famous people. Why they do like this? The main result is famous people seem to overcomes those situations and grow dramatically. However, some youth are scared risks and appear to go to only careful plannings. In this situation, I think they should be more strong and try to take risks or chances to succeed in life.
     Fist of all, people who exprience risks can learn methods to overcomes. The process to take planning may supply meaningful experiences; however, the process of overcoming challenges would become imporessive memory. It would help people find their own ways to fight against risks, then they can use these methods to succeed in life. Thus, challenging with such risks would show new ways to win in life.
     The second reasons is that letting risks or chanes in life would let people become positive. People may experience that they chose the right answer although they just selected numbers randomly in test. In this situation, if they enjoy their life without careful plaaning, they feel happy and memory that day as successful moment. However, some who think that success only comes from predictable plans would feel uncomfortable and doubt those lucky. As a result, believeing success is unpredictable will make people get energy with even small successful experiences.
     Finally, planning tends to finite various oppoortunies to try. If people always plans their days to make effective and successful days, they may get pressure to complete all of them. This pressure can limit diverse possible success. On the other hand, people doing works without specific plans can gather infinite opportunity to try, then this attitude will make easy to access to success. Therefore, planning complex methods can disturb for success in life, while people take planning to succeed effectively.
    To summarize, letting more free to get successful memories would provide ways to overcomes and make people more active. In addition, planning could limit potential possible to succeed. In conclusion, while specific planning seems to introduce right ways to succeed, risks or chances are more effective to make memorable success in life."	3.5	4.0	3.0	10.5
1680	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"     I think one of the best college in Korea is KAIST. KAIST helps students can study whatever they want. And KAIST gives us good environments. But there is a problem in campus that needs to be changed. If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I will change the location of smoking areas and the form of smoking areas in KAIST.
    First reason that I want to change smoking areas is the form of smoking areas. There are holes on walls that surround smoking areas. Through the holes, smoke move out of the smoking areas. And smoke reach other people . Because of this, in fact, the walls are useless. So, I want to change the form of smoking areas to be surrounded by  walls with no holes.
    Second, I want to change smoking areas in KAIST because of the location of them. There are some exercise equipments in campus. The purpose of them is caring our health. But there are some cases that smoking area is next to the some exercise equipments. When we exercise, we breathe fastly than usual. So, if there is smoking area next to exercise equipments, it will give really bad effects to our health. Therefore, it is ironic that smoking areas are located next to the exercise equipments.
   To summarize, there are some problems with smoking areas because of the location of smoking areas and the form of smoking areas.  Because of these reasons, we need to change the location and the form of smoking areas in KAIST to make better campus."	5.0	4.5	4.0	13.5
484	University: Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Higher Education are Not Necessary
In Korea there are several types of school such as elementary school, middle school, high school and college. Government force everyone to go to some of these schools such as elementary school by law, for help everyone to get educated; however, they donât force everyone to go to college. College teaches more specialized knowledge to help people to be more specialized, so they are called higher education. Some people believe that higher education such as college or university education should be available to all students; however, I think that it should be available only to good students. 
To begin with, government use a lot of money to support colleges. All students in college must pay tuition fee which is very expensive. Now days, government help most of students to pay for only half of their tuition fee by using their budget. According to one interview, almost 90 percent of college students answered that they have experienced help from governmentâs half tuition fee project. When college education be available to all students, huge amount of money will be wasted because of the students who are not good at studying. 
In addition, society does not need to have too much specialized people. Contents people learn in college are very specialized. In schools such as middle school, people learn about things that are necessary for living in our society. College teaches people about very specialized contents which will help them to get better jobs, however. Since there is no need for every people to be specialized, college are not necessity for all people.  
Some people argue that higher education should be available to all students because people should get chance to get higher education. However, every people get equal chance to get higher education, so this argument does not hold. Every people get equal chance to do better work and to be better students before entering higher education. When they become good students, they will get chance to enter for higher education. 
To sum up, government use a lot of money to support colleges and society does not need to have too much specialized people. All students do not have to feel like they must have to get higher education.

671	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"In every important chances in people's life, generally there are two choices: to take a risk, or not. Usually, many people doesn't take unplanned risk and just live their ordinary life. Almost of students in Korea wants to be an public worker, so that they don't have to take risks during their lives. However I believe that success comes from unexpected situations, and I will state my thesis with two concepts, experience and meeting new people.
New challenges leads to abundant experiences, which leads to improve our work ability and insight, so that we can live successful life. If we repeat our daily routine and try nothing new, we get no new experiences. Nevertheless taking risks such as starting a new project or climbing high mountains, even though we fail to succeed, we learn why we have failed. Then we are able to restart a new challenge with a better condition. Repeating risky challenges until we achieve the goal, we feel proud of what we have done, which was very hard quest throughout our life, and also we can learn a lot of things through vast experiences during numbers of failure. For my example, there was a chance to enter badminton club at my high school. Although I was very bad at sports, I decided to take a risk and learn a new sports. While learning badminton, I hurt my knee, joints and arms. But, practicing again, my ability for badminton got and my health also got better. Also I became confident to join other sports club.
In addition to that, we can meet new people while we do new kind of tasks. After we decided to try risky challenges, we have to get into a totally different environment; different place and different people. While meeting and having conversations with them, we can indirectly experience new culture, new knowledge and new style of thinking. For example, I entered a robot championship at Dubai few years ago. In the contest place, I met friends from various countries. Making global friends, I was able to know culture of Italy, new technologies of India, and new lifestyles of Greece. After that experience, my perspective got broader, and with new knowledges, fresh insights merged from my mind. From that experiences, I could improve many parts of myself.
Some might say 'safe is the best', but as I stated, it is clear that many challenges and tries will change our life dramatically. I suggest for others to try new things they didn't done before, even if it is very small thing such as having a new hobby."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

"What is a most important duty of students? Obiously, that is a study. Every student do their study by own ways. There are so many strategies to achieve a knowledge and learn something such as studying alone or studying with a group of students. However, I prefer to study with a group of students. There are some advantages than alone.
First of all, students with other students can study efficiently. They can divide a textbook with several chapters, take each parts for explanation to others.Using this strategy, each student can study only small parts of the textbook. So, they have a less stress from amounts of exam range. In fact, I often used this way with my friend. Then, I got a good grade of some biological classes. Because students who study together can save the time to prepare exam, studying together is a efficient study style.
Next, some students who prefer to study alone say that students prevent each other from concentration to study. However, I do not think so. In my case, students who study with others can check each others whether they think of only study or not. Then, it is able to make good mood for study. Therefore, making the group is good way to concentrate with study.
To sum up, there are some advantages of studying together such as efficient learning, help concentrate. Of course, that is not perfect strategy for every students. However, I have recieved some benefits by using a group-studying. Therefore, I strongly command this study style and hope many students will get good grade."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0
751	You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"In KAIST, most of students have lived in dormitories once, and dormitories act like home for those students. And most of rooms of dormitories are for two students, so it is important to meet a good roommate at first of semester. Then how can we get a nice roommate who is fit to us? There are two ways to get a roommate; one is be assigned by the university, and the other is choose the own roommate. Both of them works well, but there are some advantages with the option which is select the own roommate.
 First, students can know roommate's life pattern, characteristics, and other information. If a roommate is assigned by the university, the only information can be get is his/her name and phone number, and there is no information about life cycle, hobby, etc. If two roommates have different life patterns, they will be stressed during the whole semester because they have different wake-up time and sleeping time. In order to reduce the stress during the semester, information about roommate is necessary, so choosing roommate is a good way than the university's roommate assignment.
 Second, choosing roommate can improve both students' ability. If we choose roommate with same major, by saying each other's weakness and improvements, and teaching how they understood their major, they can improve their understand and can grasp subjects of their major. Not only in case of same major, but also in case of same hobby can expect this improvement.
 Last, live the roommate with same hobby, you can reduce stress during the semester. Students may get enormous stress due to assignments, exams, projects, etc. You can release these stress by playing games, exercise, eating, and many ways. But if they have their time with their friends, they can release their stress more efficiently by talking with
 In conclusion, choosing roommate is better than assigned roommate with three reasons; life patterns, ability improvement, and reduce stress. Some people might say with the university assign a student, students can improve their communication power and can be adjusted in social community easily. Of course, roommate assigned by the university can be good alternative way to get own roommate, but there are many chances to communicate with many unknown people, and releasing stress is more important than communication. By select own roommate, students can have happy campus life."	4.0	4.5	4.0	12.5
1170	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of the COVID-19, all colleges in Korea have done online lectures in spring and summer semesters. KAIST was not an exception. Furthermore, there are some colleges which already noticed their students that they will extend the period of online lecturing. Many students may have complaints about this decision. However, I think the online lectures are needed in this unusual situation and have advantages, and Iâll explain two of them.
	First, online lecturing makes it possible for students to manage their time schedule flexibly. Since students donât need to go to the lecturing room, so it devotes them more extra time. In addition, if some courses use the non-real-time classes as their lecture way, students can choose the time when they will listen the lectures. Therefore, students can make fluid time schedule for attending lecture. This advantage of online lecture increases the efficiency of their studies. 
	Second, colleges can prevent contagion between students since students donât gather to attend the lectures. In usual situation, students gather in the lecture room to participate in, but if we run the online classes, students do not need to move. This lessen the possibility to contact with others, so it can reduce the danger of getting COVID-19. This benefit is so important in this COVID-19 situation. As it will help the problem disappear, colleges should try to obtain this benefit. 
	To sum up, I explained the two merits of online classes, time flexibility for students, contagion prevention. Yet, real-time classes are so dangerous because of the contagious disease. Though many students want real-classroom lecture, colleges should keep this online teaching way. "	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5

"The way of people study is all different. Some people like to study alone, while others like to study together. I prefer to study with a group of students in three reasons, and I will explain why.

First, if I study with friends who are taking the same class, I can ask questions to my friend and can see what I don't know. while I'm studying alone, I can't solve my curiousity right away. I should memorize what I don't know and ask questions to my friends or professor later. Also I should go without knowing to the next step. However, while I'm studying with a group, I can solve questions emmidiately and go to the next step smoothly.

Next reason that I prefer to study with a group of students is concentration. I can concentrate on my study whlie I'm studying alone. However, if I study with a group, concentraion on my study becomes higher. There are so many  distractions such as cellphone, game, SNS, etc. Studying alone is hard to shake off obstacles, but it is possible if I study together. Once, I made a rule to play at a certaion time with the people I studied with, therefore I was able to concentrate on studying.

Lastly, if I study together, I can cheer up when studying is hard. Sometimes I want to give up because the subject I study is so difficult. Or there are times when I feel anxious because I don't have enough time to study. If I have a friends who studies with me, I am able to study with strength without give up.

To sum up, I prefer to study with a group of students because of three reasons. I hope you find a way to study well and study hard."	3.5	4.5	4.0	12.0
198	Some prefer to study alone.Â Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Â 	"I prefer to study with a group of students. There are three reasons.
   First, I can be inspired by others. When I study alone, I usually can't concentrate on studying. But when I study with a group of students, I can see other people who study and think that I should study hard too. So, It can make good result to each other. For example I didn't study much because I always be alone. However I could study well when I participate study group with ZOOM. It's very helpful for me.
   Second, I can ask what I can't understand and explain what others don't know. Most people can't understand every thing, but they can't ask or discuss when they study alone. Then they should search internet, send e-mail to professors and so on. It takes more time. I can save my time by asking to study group members. Also explaining to others makes me understand the knowledge better and get skills of explaining. I explained a lots when I was highschool students, it was more helpful than when I studied alone at that time. Someone says it is unhelpful, but it's not true. And opinion of many people helps me to think diverse ways about knowledge.
   Finally, I can make new friends and they may help me at future. Knowing a lot of people is important in society because people can't live alone. Studying group members study same subjects, so most of them would have same dream. It's likely to work together not only now. Then experience of doing a group studying should make us feel friendly. Not only this case, working with diverse kinds of people helps me when I participate other group working, work at company and so on. I think it is good experience if they don't give much advantages to studying. For instance, a frined who study chemistry with me at highschool takes this class together and gives many help each other.
To sum up, studying with a group of students helps me get concentrate on studying well, understand the knowledges more, and make new helpful friends. For these reasons, I think studying with a group of students is better than studying alone."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

"School dormitary is the place where university students that don't know much about each other meet. They share their time and space for long time, at least one semester.  Since this is quite a long time, we can see that rooms are assigned in various ways in the dormitory. For example, some people live with the friends that they already know, and other people live with unknown, random people. There can be both advantages and disadvantages on each way, but I think it's better for university to assign students to share a room with.

First of all, Students can get more opportunities to meet people and to build their relationship. There are various people in college, but the people students meet in their daily lives will be limited to students from the same department and club. However, if the school allocates dormitories, students in more diverse fields and situations will be able to meet. These factors can be seen as providing college students with a wider range of choices. For example, two students from different departments who first met can share common interests and build relationships. Due to the nature of KAIST, even if they belong to other departments, they can participate in researches or competitions together in the future. If they use a room with an existing friend, it will not be easy to get this new opportunity.

The second reason for dormitary allocation of university is that students can improve their own social skills. Since humans are social animals, interaction with others is inevitable in life. While human meets various people, they develop social skills and establish self-esteem. From this point of view, random arrangement of dormitories in schools can be considered as a means to provide more diverse opportunities to students. Learning how to get along with other people in an essential space in daily life will be of great help in improving students' communication skills. For instance, If we meet older or younger people in the dormitory, the communication skills we should have at this time will be different from those we have when living with friends. In this case, we can fully learn and understand the required skills during the semester.

Also, there is reason for universities, the efficiency. In the case of random arrangement, the school will collectively implement and notify, and then students can exchange rooms if necessary. For this case, communication between the school and the students can be done in both directions, and communication between students is also made only when necessary, so the method is simple. However, if they choose arbitrarily among themselves, communication will be complicated and it will take more time because an agreement must be reached between all students in advance. In addition, the opportunities for communication between the school and the students are reduced, so additional efforts are required for communication.

In conclusion, there are three main reasons for dormitary assignment for students by universtiy. Eventhough there can be some reasons that students' choice are prefered, I think university have to assign students to share a room with for both students and university. Maybe you can try it for a semester to meet special people that can fullfill your weaknesses"	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0
1878	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"Positive Effect for Studying Abroad

 Earth we are living is getting smaller as time flows. Of course the size of Earth is same since it was made.

 First positive effect for studying abroad is different culture they have. When you travel other countries, you will easly notice the different culture between different countries.

It may help you when you immgrate or choose to have job in that country. Studying abroad is not just ateending to school, you will get chance to learn second language and culture.

 Socond reason students choose to study abroad is name of school or university. Their are famous universities in the world. Students who want to study in one of these famous school could choose studying in other countries. There are many benefits when you study in famous university. University that you graduate is important in your life. It matters when you get a job or when you choose to study farther more. Also, these famous university is famous for reason.

" Anything I will change from my county, will become something problematic, personal or non personal. I love my country, but also I can see various flaws like economy, birth rates.. etc from here too. So it will be not so easy picking a single changement.

I am watching some serious situations going around all over the world, and the most important thing I have in mind is the warfare. Several countries continuing war in the 21 century, the age who never passed through war gave a huge impact for everyone, including me. From the news from Russia and Ukraine, reminds me that South Korea has not yet escaped entirly from the terror of the war. And this is the one I wish I could change from my country. To end the war permenantly, and freeing the painful history for our new future.
Starting a war and winning always gave some countries wealth and development in history. But in 21th century, the meaning and potential cost of war became unmeasurable. The destructive weapons made massive, or possibly, global destruction possible, and quick inform connection around the world created the blaming and horror to reach everywhere, anytime. the meaning of warfare has evolutionized through time.  War is not just a problem solver like past anymore. This is the reason I would change the state that we, South Korea is still going through the war.  I am pretty sure lots of people will agree with me anyone who encounters this question. War is the most confusing problem in this state, because we are watching a war from other countries. Not like before, the war zone is now visible through the internet, we can emphathize it better. Anyone who watches the terror of the war will never want to think about it, just like I did.
Ending the war in Korea will solve lots of problems in our country at once. It will solve a part of economic issues, nearby country relationship problems, and so on. This is another reason I wish of ending war, expecting various things intead of only one"	2.5	2.5	2.0	7.0
1232	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" First, when we join lecture by online we can have more choices. if we not, we have consider the place of the lecture. for example i want to listen two lecture A,B. and lecture B starts right after lecture A. at school we have to run from class A to B where lecture starts. 
 Second, we have many chance to be close with each other. we don't have much information about college, lecture, HW so, we have to make friends to ask about it. for example, at first semester professor gave us team projects make presentation about topic what we choose. to do more perfectly our group talk about topic for a long time. at that long run we can get more closer. 
 Third, the transfer of information is fast. many students have question and information. we can transfer it at apps such like 'everytime' 'facebook'. by using these apps we can get information that we can trust. also professors and TA can spread information quickly by using 'KLMS' 'Kaist portal'"	3.0	3.0	2.5	8.5
874	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I strongly believe that university students should be required to attend classes in time. It would be the most effective method to prevent various side-effects. What would be the side-effects of being absent during the classes?
  First, It would trigger increase of private education. Some people might argue that the university students don't have to attend class if they already know the content of class. However, that is definitely wrong argument. Let's think of the goal of listening to class for many students. They exactly listen to classes in order to get a good grade(GPA). So, if participation score is not counted for a grade, they have actually no reason to attend classes. Therefore many students would not attend classes regardless of knowledge about the content of the class. And in the case of the students who don't know exactly about the content of the class, they would fall into private education in order to get a good grade. Then the market of private education about university classes would be larger and larger, which would decrease the importance of university lecture by professor.
  Second, It would get rid of the opportunities to keep relationship between professor and students. The goal of lecture by professor is not only to convey useful information about the subject, but also to keep in touch with students. Professors would introduce their research field related to the lecture during class, and some students, who had interest with the research field, would contact the professor. And it provides an opportunity for them to grow up while they communicate with professor more deeply than in the class.
  In conclusion, I strongly think that the university students should attend classes in order to prevent private classes and keep opportunity to make relationship between professor and students. Let's say you're a professor. You would have lots of knowledge about the lecture and want to share the experience to your students. Then I guess you might be very happy if all students participate your class and focus on that as they ask questions about your research. Let's go to Advanced Writing class now!"	3.0	3.0	3.5	9.5
1919	In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Good Students's Qualities

     If you are student, you may find other students easily arrounding you. In addition to find them, you would feel something to each of them in terms of student, and also you can realize what are the qualities of a good student. Although it may not be the best qualities of a good student, I think a good student's qualities are  effort, honest and kindness.
 The first quality of a good student is effort. The word ""student"" means a person who learn something, so it is necessary to doing effort to his learning. Also, students often get a part for a work in their group such as class and shcool. A good students do thier best on their work, so their groups can do more effectively. 
  In addition to the effort, the second important quality of a good student is honest. In many cases, honest is essential for good students, but many students don't be honest for their examination. All students have to take thier examination, and they may get scores of each subjects. For example, if a teacher gave points  more than a student's original score, there are few students to say teacher honestly.  
 To summarize, good students have three qualities those are effort, honest and kindness. I think effort, honest, kind students are good students, so I recommend you to do your best to be those student. After being that student, you can be better student against before."	3.0	3.0	3.0	9.0
1995	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In modern society, most of people are following their life routine. They wake up, go to work, come back home and sleep. This is too boring and make people exhausted. People want to break their life routine. They need more unique experience to refresh and traveling is one of the best way to get some unique experiences. There are three reasons.
First, we can see different sight. In the everyday routine, people see same buildings, same road and same people. But when we travel, there's new buildings and cultures. Watching unfamiliar sight can be special experience to people. They feel interesting to everything and feeling interesting is good at refreshing.
Second, we can eat different foods. Every country has their own special foods. We can eat curry when travel to India. We can eat sushi when travel to Japan. Even in the same country, there are many special foods by region. Eating unfamilar and delicious foods makes people happy.
Finally, we can listen different languages. Most of people use one language during everyday routine. But when we travel, we can listen different languages or accect. Sound this important because it is always effects to people. Listening unfamiliar sound can be a special experience.

Thesedays, because of Covid-19, it is hard to do some hobbies such as exercise. So do I. I am freshman of the college, but I can't do my hobbies that much. So, I usually walk around while listening to music. I think walking is a very good hobby for college students, and these are my reasons.
First of all, it is an activity that I do alone. It sounds like a badside of it, but in Corona pandemic, it could be an advantage. Nowadays, it is hard to meet friends and play each other. However, when we walk, we do not have to worry about it. Also, while walking, you can think about yourself. I usually walk and think about today. Sometimes I feel good, and sometimes I regret with my mistake. I think It could be a new experience for you.
Also, walking can make us healthy. Walking is very easy activity and we do this all day, but did you know walking is very efficient exercise? When we walk, we can get lid of bad things in our body by sweating. And we lose fat in our body, too. Also, we can get fresher air than inside of your room. For more, we can feel fresh after walking. 
Finally, by walking, we can go and see new side of our college. Usually, we use car to go some where. It is very fast, but because of that point we can not see the things of our town and college. While walking around the college, we can see trees, flowers, sky. Sometimes we could go to landmark near the college. Maybe, it will be your best place ever you been. Who knows?
Because of Covid-19, I know all of us feel low and exhausted. From today, how about walking around of your college? It will be fun than you are thinking!"	3.0	2.5	2.5	8.0
1360	In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details toÂ support your opinion.	" When we live, we need many people for us. Friends are very important for many reasons like we can talk each other, play with friends, or do other things. So it is important to have a good friends. I think there are some qualities of good friends. Now, I will write about some qualities that good friends should need.

 First of all, friend and me should understand each other about difference. Everyone is different in some ways like opinion or other things, so there can be trouble between friends and me. But if me and my friend understand each other, there would be no problem. And we can develop our weakness from talking about each other. Then, we would be a good person. So I think it is important to undestand each other.

 Second, there should be some similar hobby between us. If we have same hobby, we can enjoy that hobby together and we can be more close. Also we can talk about that hobby more deeply so we can have more fun about it. For example, if me and my friend play same computer game, it will be more fun when play that game together. So I think it is good to have simmilar hobby with friends.

 Last qualities that I think of a good friend is kindness. If someone is not kind, other people may not want to have close relationship with him. And if we become a friend who is not kind, we can be like him because we spend a lot of time with friend. If we become a friend who are very kind, we can be more kind like him. So I think kindness is important qualitiy of good friend. 

  In this paragraph, I wrote about three qualities of a good frineds. Of course there are more other qualities that good friend should need, but I think these qualities are the most important thing to be good friends."	3.5	3.5	3.0	10.0

2273	If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" I have lived in Korea for 17 years. Also I have traveled many Asian countries like China, Vietnam. Therefore I often compare the Korean culture, history or other aspect with those in other countries. Usually, I like Korean culture and history. However, I always thought that location of the Korea is very bad thing. I thougt that because our country is very small, close to strong countries, and far from the Europian countries.
 First, size of Korea is very small. I think that the smaller the land is, the less human who can work for the country, and it lead the weakness of that country. As we live in small land, population in our country must be small. And I think population is one of the most important part to make the country stronger. If we build our country on other land which is much bigger than Korea, population would be increase exponantially, and it will make our country stronger.
 Now, let me talk about the countries close to Korea. Near Korea, there is China and Russia in north, and Japan in South. This three countries have fought for more than 50 years to absorb Korea. Japan attacked our countries a lot of times during the Korean history. Many strong countries in China attacked Korean land for many times. Mongolian attacked us in1200s, and Russia tried to control our country in late 1800s. Moreover China and Japan is still arguing with Korea about historical problems. I think that if our country was built on another site that  is far from those countries, we might not experience those sad histories.
 Finally, Korea is far from Europian countries. Europian countries experienced the industrial revolution and increased the science knownledge and technology. Therefore, acquiring Europian countries' technology quickly might make our countries stronger enough to endure the attack from China and Japan. But Korea's condition was not good to acquire those technologies and we have to get them through China. I think It was the reason that we have to be controled by China.
 For these reasons, I think our countries location is the important aspect to change. Sometimes I think that our ancestors should have made Korea in another location."	3.0	3.0	3.0	9.0

I think there are two qualities of a good student. A good student study well and respect old people.
    First of all, students have to study hard. Study is reason of going to school. We learn huge amount of knowledge and it is very helpful to live a life. For example, if who didn't study about basic laws do illegal thing, it can be punished. Understanding how to live is important for students.
    Not only study, but also respect is quality of a good student. Students should respect old people in school like teachers. When we start social life, there are many old people than us. Old people are wise and we can get a lot of benefits through them. We can practice social life through respect teacher.

"If I could change one, I will going  to change the president , or to say the chief of the one country . The leader of one's country have  its good power to change its nation. Let me example this on  the Korea. TH e President Park,  which  has  geartly  developed the k orea's economy, had made the fundamental  that Korea could thrive and become the wealthy  country. But both , we tried to be the dictator changing the  law. The democracy held its power during that time. Only one person could be very substential of the country's extrinsic part( economy, military, diplomacy, etc.)
Also, can have effect  on intrinsic part (like country's image, society's thoughts). I know one example of this intrinsic change caused by one person on Korea. The daughter of President park that I have said earlier, had become president, like her father. And see  had in very big trouble showing  off  her incapability doing the work of one's nation. THe result brought disappointment and despair to the teenagers and the lad of the Korea. Lots of people had seen dark side of society and showed anger and grief.
Now, she left and new president came to his throne. And, I don't think he is doing good job on many part. However, I was surprised that he had made very unreasonable decision of the energy industry, to say De-Nuclear powerplant project. He said he had felt the danger of the nuclear power after watching 'the movie' which doesn't contain any scientific information.
By his decision, nulcear oriented industries and the studying groups became helpless waiting the goverment's declarement. Korea's nuclear powerplant technologies are losing its futuer and having the dark age. And the cost for used electricity is going up and up. One person brought this result.
The leader of one nation should be well known about lots of things including the diplomcy, military, economy. And one of the most important thing is the energy politics.
If the chief of one nation is having bad decisions about it, the people deserves to change one important thing, the president."	3.5	3.0	2.0	8.5
2278	If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Every country have its own culture and special aspects, and this is more unique when the country has a long history. We could have proud about this, but not everything is good. There are things to be changed. The thing that I want to change is a dismatch between genders.
     One of biggest problem in our country nowadays is gender. There are lots of fight between man and woman groups, even from a tiny little reason. One example is that there was a commercial poster from government and  people said their hands looks similar with handshape which radical feminists are using. People then started to find every commercials that looks similar, even posters that are made decades ago. Fight between two groups are getting worse, while other countries tring to fix descrimination between man and woman.
     I think the biggest reason this happened is because of our past culture. In Choseon dinesty, country believed youguo(I don't know the name). In that culture, womens' rights were much less than mens'. Only man could have a nice job and son got all the money from their parents. However, Korea was the fastest country in developing. We didn't get rid of bad culture yet, but country developed and feminism came to our country. This is neccessary culture, but some of radical people used this to attack man, and some radical men attacked back. I think this is why the thing happened.
    Actually, I don't know the specific answer to solve this problem. But the biggest reasons are internet groups. Some groups that have wrong thinkings spread strange culture to others, and it is fast. I think making real names in internet could make this better. One reason that they can do these things because no one knows who they are. Finding these websites and blocking would be difficult, but would help too."	3.5	3.0	3.5	10.0

So I prefer to study with a group in some cases: group have enough knowledge to study more and they really want to study. If students in group not good enough to study certain topic, studying in group will not help us. In this situation, I can concentrate in studying more when I study alone. On the other hand. we have big problem or project to solve, we can't study about it alone. We must share ideas and discuss with other students in group. For example, I was in urp program and my teammate helped each other. We can learn more with talking with each other. But when I tried to study final exam with friends, we just played when we meet.

Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"One of the biggest issue of the Korean parents thesedays is the early-education. Due to the enforcement of them, Korean students usually start being educated very early from about 5 or 6 years old. I guess the purpose of that kind of education is focused on the enterance to the high level university which is believed to be related to the success of life. In order to be the student of S.K.Y. student, individuals need to get highest grade from their highschool. Since the coverage of the sighschool education is vast, becomming the summa cum laude means the whole comprehensions for every subjects with full of knowledge and informations. This cause the requirment of studying the course in highschool before the highschool. Thus to introduce the knowledge of highschool, the middle school coverages should be already understood by him or her and so on and so on. 
Since now, the early-education strategy seems to work some extent, however there are some severe problems with it. First, students do not have the passion to study. Student who has mechanically done with their learning with the press of their parents might easily have the mide opposing the pressure. All the peaple had eagerness for the freedom. Freedom from the pressure of study would not work positively for the personal improvement via studying. Second, students who learned the concept before become less participating student of actual class. This leads to a bad habbit of not listening to person. For instance, In usual Korean highschool, 90% of the students sleeps during the class. It would weaken the deliver of the educational intention.  And lastly, student assumed to be the highest-level university student lose thier dream and waste thier time instead of the hard working to improve themselves or to contribute to the world or society. I have many friends with same problems. They just studied as what their parents said and believed the dream their parents provided. However, experiences they made in university indicates they does not fit in to the major or researcher society. Some of them regret their past times just following the advices and live with liquor and computer games. It is very bad for themselves  and to society both.
For those reasons, I disagree with the early-education."	2.5	2.5	2.0	7.0

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Every people want to success in their lifes. To do so, some plan for their futures, and others take risks. Although these two strategies have pros and cons, it is better to take risks to be successful.
    First, although planning might bring good results, it might not be the best one. People make plans based on their memories. When something goes good, people remember it and do similar things to get good results. However, most of the cases, it might be local maximum. Therefore, if people want to get successful results, they must take risks and do something they haven't done before to get to the global maximum. For example, when practicing playing basketball, planning guy might practice shooting or dribling. On the other hand, risking guy would play many games and learn while playing.
    Second, learning from failures is effective way to become a master at something. Risking strategy might bring a lot of failures. However, one can learn from those. For example, Thomas Edison failed more than a thousand times to invent a light bulb. If he used planning strategy, he might have used so much time just sitting on a desk and planning to make a perfect light bulb.
    To sum up, to success in life, taking risks is better than planning for future. By taking risks, one can reach global maximum of success and learn from failures to be ready for one's future. Nobody knows what whould going to happen. Since plan can always be ruined, it is better to make a bet."	3.5	3.0	3.5	10.0

The jump of kangaroo, and sleeping koala at the tree... They were so cute that I want to touch them. Also, I feed them some food, and that was amazing experience. You should have to see that kangaroo's muzzle was digging the feeding bag.

And people might be travel for this reason, not only for fun. In Korea, there is a quote like this; You can learn much more if you see something once than listening something hundred times. Traveling can be a great study for many people.
 I lived in the same place for almost 13 years. What I can see over the window is always same. Just an apartment. I think same scenery and same mood make my creativity worse than before. Because I just watched same thing for 13 years, my thought and idea that generates are always similar. I think lots of people are dealing with similar situation like me. We need inspired moment. It not only makes our feeling better, but also different thinking and idea. For example, lots of artists visit Paris to get inspiration. It means they can gain something different compare to their city in Paris. There is a limitation if we try to study everything by book or lecture. By book, we just learn Baekdo mountain is the highest in this Peninsula. But, I think we can feel the height of Baekdo mountain by climbing it. And the memory will last longer if we feel it. So we need to see and feel directly. I think traveling is good way to do this if we aren't planning to study abroad.
 Travel always mentioned as one of the best hobby of humans. They feel healed, inspired. That is because travel is a kind of process which makes people get away from their repitive reality for a moment. I think people like to see and feel new thing. They want to be inspired and their brain want it. And travel can satisfy their hunger. So people travel, again and again."	3.0	2.5	3.0	8.5
1632	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	These days, many schools and colleges are having online classes because of the COVID 19. Here are 3 advantages of taking online courses. First, we don't have to move to take classes or go to school. Students who are in a college which have big campus size, moving around during breaktime makes one-self very tired. Plus, for the case of my friend, since she didn't ë±ë¡ dormitory, she spend more than 2 hours to go to her school every day. On the other hand, if we take online classes, we don't have to move to take class during breaktime, and we don't have to go to school neither. Second, professors can open huge classes which many students can join. For example, the class CoE202(ì¸ê³µì§ë¥ ìë¬¸), the student number who are attending this class is more than 270. If this was not online class, it will be (ííì¬ì§ë¤) on a big hall. However, thanks to the zoom, we can take CoE202 with a good quality. (Good quality means we can see the slide, hear professor's voice clearly) Finally, if there is a online platform, such as google classroom or KLMS, it is very convenient. For example, it is much easy to see some notifications, send homeworks to TAs etc.	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

When I walk to the street, there are too many people that smoking in the not smoking zone. Eventhough there are many smoking zones, people smoke anywhere. More serious, no one talk to them to go to the smoking zone. If people smoke anywhere, the cigaratte's smoke is everywhere in the town and it will hurt us.

775	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	" All students have their own studying methods and skills. Some students  like studying alone better, and other students like studying together with their friends much more. Each method has their own advantages, but In my case, i like studying  by making teams more. There are three reasons for it.
   First reason is that i can learn what i didn't know from  people whom i'm studying with. Although i listened the class carefully and study hard alone, something that i don't know or understand exists. When we study toghether, there is a probability that someone knows this. 
   Second reason is that i can get the mind of improvement.  When i study alone, i do not study hard. Because there is  no other people who are studying around me. So i don't want to study either and play with phone. However, when i study with a grop of students, there are many people who are studying around me. Therfore, i aslo begin to study too.  Aslo i have Desire to get better grades than other people, so seeing other peolple studying is good motivate to me.   
   At last, by teaching other study memebers, i can understand more correctly.  Not only be taught from other study members, but also teaching  other students  is a good way to study.  When i teach other people, i can organize our knowledge that i am going to say .  if i do this, i can remember the knowledge for long period of time than before. furethermore, i can realize my weak part when i teach the whole part i know.  
  To summarize, because i can learn new knowledge, inspire to study hard and reviw my knowledge i prefer study with a grop of studnents more.  "	2.5	2.0	1.0	5.5
612	If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Â 	"Many companies want to bring benefit in markets. So, companies hire great workers to win in competition. But companies also want to minimize money to spend on workers. Of all discussion that surface in society, the debate over whether it is better to hire an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary remains contentious. Although some people claim that hiring an inexperienced worker at a lower salary is better, I believe that hiring an experienced worker at a higher salary help company's growth.
The most essential reason that experienced workers work efficiently. Experienced workers learned properties of working area, and experienced various programs to work in previous companies.
In addition to the notion that experienced workers work efficiently, experienced workers know how hang out with company's people. Communication is an important element to solve problems. Experienced workers already experienced society life. So, experienced workers feel more comfortable when experienced workers talk each other.
As aforementioned paragraphs clearly  delineate, hiring an experienced worker at a higher salary is better to grow company. Hiring an experienced worker is more important than spending higher salary."	2.5	2.5	3.0	8.0
686	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"I think that saving money is better for three reasons.  
 First of all, wasting money without appropriate plans is very dangerous. In the future, we do not know what happens to us. For example, all of us can face unpredictable and serious accidents such as physical accidents or economic difficulties. In these cases, if we do not have emergency money or plans, we will face to bankruptcy. We can never recover these enormous damages. 
 Second, we can make more money by saving or investing instead of just spending money. Today, not only rich guys, but also normal people invest to stocks and real estates. Spending money without plans is just same with wasting money. As a result, we will lose opportunities to duplicate more money. Some people say the best way to become rich is to investments. It is too late after spending all of our money to invest. We do not have enough time to waste money because economic knowledge to manage money is very precious and learning this knowledge will be much more helpful to our lives. 
 For the last reason, it is about human's habits. Human is an animal of adaptation. If we start spending money freely, we will realize the feeling  and happiness of spending. Well, this is not always bad, but we might be afraid to go back frugal life. This phenomenon can be very serious unless we are economically strong or do not have restrained mind. We will sometimes overspend and this is likely to lead to financial difficulties. Self-realization by spending money and consuming is excellent and necessary for most people, but it is also important to have a habit of saving.
 For these three reasons, saving money is better for us, and we need to consider how to save money and manage them effectively.

1268	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Some people think that my country have to ensure social safety. Another people think country have to reduce tax. However,in my opinion, I think that my country have to enhance military power. There military power include any kind of military such as airforce or army.

The first reason is that if Korea want to achieve profit between other country, military force enhence is neccesary. Korea is located between China and America one is most powerful country in the world and other is second. Forthemore, China's policy is very scary since they want to stand on other coundtry. It is not different of America but it little bit over. If Korea don't have self-protecting force, it will be very nervous to control relationship. For example, Korea empire in 1900s collapsed. that didn't have enough power to protect itself, another country outbreak war in Korea. Even when Donghak nongmin army  which is consist with normal farmer against with goverment, goverment was help by japan. Finally empire collapsed.

Second, nowday S.Korea conflit with N.Korea. Korea war outbreaked in 1950s but war is not finish. N.korea have ready to make war. Some people  say N.korea lost any trantional threat. Nevertheless, they have enough ability to make confuse country foundmental economy, because of stragical weapon like uclear. For instance, N.korea shoot missile to seuol or industry area, there damage can't calculate. When one uclear missile among with many stragical weapon form N.korea strike seoul, S.Korea will get astronomical damage. So millitary force is very important to provent form war.

To sum up, Korea have to enhance Military force because achieve profit between strong country and prevent next Korea war. In this regard, I insist strongly about them.

But people who use english, chiness and ë¶ì´, can use their languange in other countries. Because these languages are famous and a lot of people using. If my country's language is changed english or other, It will be more comfortable to live in this world.

Second, It's very rare that korean is used main language. Almost world contests use english or other language as main. So if we want to join contest, we must change our document language. It's hard work. And also if the document is poem or book, we can't show our feel very well. Because some feeling is only showed by korean such as 'í', 'íì´ìê² íë¤'.

2040	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Recently, most of college taking online course because of corona virus.  Online course means, student and professor do not meat each other in real classroom, but they meat at online by using zoom and google class, etc. This  course has two advantages for the student.
 First of all, online course is convenient. For example, student and professor do not have to go college classroom before begin the class. They just sit on chair in home and office, next turn on PC and attendance at online. It is so simple and easy. This advantage makes student focus on study more and makes professor focus on teach more.
 In addition, online course saves money, because college do not have to spend much money at class. Students do not use classroom and college building, also they do not doing real study like experiment and visit museum. Therefore, college can use more money at student's life quality and professor's research. 
 To sum up, when college taking online course, student and professor can use time valuable. Therefore it is convenient. Also college can save money to upgrade student's life and professor's research. "	3.0	4.0	3.0	10.0

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Students have a lot of necessaries to study at university; attendance, term exams, and several quizzes. Some people thinks that university students should have to attend classes, while others do not. I totally believe that university students should be required to attend classes. There are several reasons as follows.

First of all, measuring attendance score will improve student's academic skills. Students who participate frequently in classes can easily understand the information the professor teach. These students are likely to receive a good grade in university. For example, In my case, I was not great students at first grade of KAIST. I always went to play soccer and not to classes because I did not understand what professor talked about. After getting extremely low score at mid-term exam, I decided to attend all classes even though I could not understand lectures. Gradually, I can conceive the lecture because they provide me a number of demonstrations and illustrations. Therefore I took better scores at final exam. I realized that if I did not join in classes, I would fallen behind.

Second, Students can broaden their networks by attending classes. If students attend classes, they could easily share their ideas about lectures. This opportunities tends to create new network they interested in. For instance, Sangwoo, my classmate, was introvert student who feel difficult to mingle with others. He has a few friends to get along with. However, He got a lot of new friends after joined the physics seminar class. I asked him how did he make friends and I got an answer like this, ""There are a lot of people like me. They have many common things."" He usually play computer game and study with that friends. If he did not join the seminar, he would felt lonely.

To sum up, I strongly believe that students in university have to attend classes.  "	3.0	3.0	3.0	9.0
1776	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" A few months ago, the program 'You Quiz' interviewed dean of my university, KAIST. He was very unique and impressing person. Also, the most important thing that I recognized is he always has a passion and vision for KAIST, and try to develop our university. Constrastly, I'm just a freshman after all with much less passion and vision for KAIST. So, I don't want to change vision or lecture of dean and professor. FIrst, I don't know that much, and I agree with their opinion. Finally I would change one important but not important, the location.
Sadly, some of my high school student prefer Seoul University to KAIST. One of the bigest reason was KAIST is in ëì . This fact have profit, of course. Students can concentrate studying. Labs can concentrate research more. Wide campus. Fresh air. Ducks. Reduce moving all infra to Seoul too much. But I want to move KAIST near to Seoul. I can say this opinion because I know it is impossible. I'll tell you the benefits that KAIST will get if it moves to near to Seoul. The only reason is there are too much people, infra, conference. Moving KAIST will make KAIST access easily to Seoul. 1/5 of Korean live in Seoul. KAIST have amount of students in Seoul. And also many conference and university in Seoul. But we have to use train, bus, or car. All of these take more than 3 hours. And we have to spend for oil and ticket. KTX is 50,000won once. We can save time and money of students and professor. Also we can expect that KAIST may contact to other university easier.
Some of you can worry about students don't study and just play. But, I said I'll do not move to Seoul, but near to Seoul. Let's just reduce the distance between Seoul and KAIST. Seoul will be not so far, also not so near. Students have to spend time and money to go to Seoul still.
So, I would move KAIST to somewhere near to Seoul. Because of amount of infra and university in Seoul, It will save our money and time. "	2.5	2.0	3.0	7.5
1831	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"When I was young, I couldn't travel much because I have to study hard. And nowadays, I have lots of time, but because of COVID-19 situation, we can't visit abroad. So I always wanted to take a trip in various countries. If I have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks, I would like to visit Germany. And there are three reason why I want to visit Germany.
        First, motor companies of Germany are very famous. After I took my driver license in summer vacation, I am very interested in cars. Espcially in supercar companies such as BMW, Audi, Porsche. And these brands are all started in Germany. So I want to visit Germany and see these companies' offices and cars in there. And I also want to learn about my interest, autonomous car in there.
        Next, I want to take part in Octoverfest. When I was young, I read about Octoberfest in a book of Germany culture. And the book said Octoberfest is the three most biggest festival in the world. In Octoberfest, people eat famous Germany foods, such as beer, potato and sausage. These are my favorite foods. And I have not joined in any big festival in Korea. So I want to go Germany to join Octoberfest.
        Lastly, Germany soccer league is famous. As you know, Germany soccer league, Bundesliga, always ranks in top 5 leagues in world. And many star players plays big matches in Bundesliga. I always wanted to see these big matches in stadium, but K-league is the only league that I have watched in stadium. So I want to visit stadiums in Germany and see some wonderful soccer games.
      Supercars, Octoberfest and Bundesliga.These are why I wanted to visit Germany. But I know that it is hard to visit Germany because of the COVID-19. I hope this disease end faster and want to take wonderful Germany trip with this three famous things of Germany."	3.0	3.5	2.5	9.0
780	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	" The new president of KAIST is keep amphasizing the importance of taking risks or changces. In fact, new laboratory for studing failure made this year. I believe this new movement will make KAIST better in the future.
 Although some people believe that they can control risks by careful planning, risks are our of our hands. One great example would be Corona pandemic. Even though someone made careful plans, they could not avoid it. So, taking risks at least in regulated circumstances, such as schools, will prepare people more to adjust in this randomized world.
 The next advantage is that taking risk makes you plan better. Taking risks means that you challenges more. By doing so, you can get more information about your ability and capability. Then you can make plans more percisely based on that information. In my case, I took risk of taking 10 courses this semester. Now, at the near end of the semester, I can understand my capability more clearly. So, now I can make more suitable study plans after this semester.
 To summarize, taking risk is more likely to lead to success. Although it can be an efficient way, we have to admmit failuer is usually painful. The president of KAIST should find ways to support the risk takers by developing new policies."	3.0	2.5	3.0	8.5

we live in our country with many people, not alone. So we should obey the rules. For example, we have some law to protect our personal life. But i think that the law cannot protect all of problem which can occur in our public life. So there are implicit rules of conscience. For example, we must do not throw trash without permission. Because that trash can trigger serious environmental pollution. Also, we should be quiet when we are in public place. Because if we are noisy, people can be damaged. Like this, there are some important implicit rule even though  this rule is not specified in the law. But are people following this rule well? I can say no. For example, when we walk the street, there are so many trash anywhere and that makes the viewers frown. In the public park, there are so many trash so we can not play well. Not only this, but it can occur serious air pollution. In actually, pollution problem is issue in all country. And some cafe or sotre use so many disposable thing. Disposable thing is one time using product so it can effect bad to our environment. Actually, more and more animal which live in forest can die becasue of unnecessary trash. we must prevent this problem together. So I want change this mind of people that âwe can trash anywhereâ. Even it is little uncomfortable, we must trash in the trash can. And we should do recycling and less using disposable thing. If our people do this well, we can prevent pollution problem. For do this well, people have to change their ownâs mind first.

They do not try new things and try just maintain their circumstances. But I prefer to try new things even if there are some risks. There are a few reasons to support my opinion.

First, to try new things is very interesting. All people cannot know what happen in the future, even a few seconds later. And all people have limited time to do something. So it is important to try new things in our own life. People can do only what they do well. However, what they do well is not same with what they want to do. As I mentioned, people has limited time but they want to do what they want. It is essential to try new thing. It must be some risks to try new things. But it is more valuable than do only what they already do well. I'd like to try new things with risks.

Seconds, we have to learn new things always. All people have their own talent and what they already do well. However, the environments and society change so people have to learn new skills or try new things to adapt the environments. For example, labors in 20th, they lost their jobs because of the appearance of conveyor belts. So they have to learn and try new things that conveyor belts can't do.
There are many example such as AI, robots, etc. We have to develop and learn new things to make sense and to prevent to lost our jobs. 

In conclusion, to try new things is interesting, people have limited time. And people have to learn new thing to adapt changing society. I prefer to try new things even if there are risks for this reasons. I hope people try to do new things."	3.0	3.0	3.0	9.0

I thinks that BTS, the most famous K-pop artist, is great example in tinfluence people's behatviorhat case. I think videos 


First of all, Movies and TV Program are combined the society. 
Producer who make movies and his or her co-worker should analyse about what is popular and funny in people's mind. So people get fun from that movies,
Second, video can give more stimulation than other material.
More than 60 years ago, the only device that can get informations in korea is radio. radio sends sound and people hear that. In this case, people only use thier ears. However, In this time, videos are main tools that spread informations. During COVID-19 pandemic, video flatform such as youtube, Netflix and wavve etc can fastest grow and we see a movie in that flatform. This fact give some idea that Movies and TV program can create cultural power for people, too.
Last reason, popular makes wave in culture.
Anyone can make culture wave for thier own's benefit. If people don't like specific culture, culture is destroy in that time. We already know great example in China. China goverment still tried to chinese culture spread in many country like K-pop, but they get failure.

    In general, students have winter or summer vacations for taking a break. In the vacation, students go to trip, learning swimming, or do something that they want. Some argues that they want only one long vacations to do more things. However, several short vacations are helpful for several reasons.
          First of all, several short vacations can be one of powers for studying. Almost people wish that weekends come faster; furthermore, there is word to greet weekends, TGIF: Thanks God Its Friday. Thus, holiday is one of the power for standing their work. Vacation also do this role for students. Therefore, several vacation means several powers for studying.
          In addition, several short vacations can reinforce defects. When students take the classes, there can be exist unknown things. Vacations are one of good times for reinforcing their defects in studying or other fields; for example, they can learn powerpoints skills if they want to improve presentations.
          Lastly, several short vacation can maintain study habits. Some argues that long vacation can do more and deeper activities. However, most important duty for students is studying. Long vacation can make students forgetting their studying habits since they are concentrate other things that they want. Therefore, several short vacation is helpful to study.
          To sum up, several short vacations are helpful because this can be a power for studying. Furthermore, several short vacation can not only  reinforce defects, but also maintain study habits.

There are many stores and restaurtant. But, they are not interesting to me. For this reason, When I play my friend nearby my hometown, I'm unsatisfyed because there are no place to play with.

1627	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	Due to the COVID-19, many schools including colleges are having online courses to prevent the disease. Since this was a quite rare experience, many students were able to know some advantages of taking online courses. In my opinion, the advantages of taking online courses are that we have opportunities of better understanding of the courses and also we are able to save time and energy. First advantage I thought was that having online courses provided us the opportunities of better understanding of the courses. This can be in many ways. First, until today, we had to go to the classroom in the right time. However, since the time we take the course became comparatively flexible, we could take the courses whenever our thoughts are clear, rather than listening to the lecture from the early morning with not-awakened brain. Second, since many of the lectures are done through the online video, it became much more easier to take time to have note-taking, or think again about the stuffs that we are struggling with. Last, although it may be similar to the second reason, it became easier to search about things that we don't know quickly through the Internet, since the lectures are online. Second advantage is that we can save time and energy. In school, we have to move the classes frequently to take the different classes. Especially for the college, many classrooms are in different buildings, which takes so much time. This is not only linked to the time problem, but also to the energy problem. There is only small limited time to move between the classes, so after we move, sometimes we get too exhausted to concentrate for the next class. All these problems are not going to happen through the online courses, so isn't it beneficial to have online courses that will save your time and also the energy to study? Sure, having online courses can disturb students from making a lot of new college friends, or it can also make them lazy. However, there are a lot of benefits like these from having the online courses. So, don't be so gloomy that you are not able to enjoy your campus life, but think positively that this is the chance for you to experience a lot of new things by yourself and earn the rich knowledge.	3.5	3.0	3.5	10.0

869	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	I think university students should attend their classes. First, in class, we can learn many things. It is difficult to understand something only by books. If we listen to the professor's explanation in class, we can understand more when we just read books. When trying to understand the same thing, it is easier to understand by listening to explanations in words than by reading them in writing. Second, we can ask questions in class when we have something we don't know. As we learn new content, we have something we don't know. In class, we can immediately ask the professor what we don't know. However, it will not be easy to know what we don't know unless we attend class. Finally, I think it is rude to the professor not to participate in class. Professors give lectures to teach us something. The professor will also take the time to prepare various things to give lectures. I think not attending class ignores this professor's efforts. For these three reasons, I think university students must attend classes.	2.5	2.5	3.5	8.5
1354	In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details toÂ support your opinion.	 I think the qualities of a good friend are friend who I feel convenient and who I can trust and share our thinking, who I want to do something together. First, a good friend is the friend who I feel convenient. If I stay in same place with a not good friend, I will feel nerverous and think to avoid this place. And unconvenient friends are not actually friends. They are just people who my friend know or meet me brief time or I feel afraid. These kind of friends is not real friends. Second, the friend who I can trust and share our thinking is very friendly to me. If the friend cheats me, I can't trust him and share many things like thinking, mind, secret. But the good friend, I can do that. Finally to do something with unconvenient person is suffered me. When I was highschool student, I must be team with person who I hate. 	2.0	2.5	2.5	7.0
627	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"I prefer doing what I am already good at for three reasons.
First, I have tendancy to focus on one sepecific genre or content. For example, I usually play video games of specific genre with my laptop when I have free time. I have played FPS game, which stands for First Pirson Shooting game, since when I wan middle school student and I'm still big fan of FPS. Also, I like listening one specific music over and over. I make playlist contains only one music, and I repeat the playlist for several hours.
Second, I like having feeling that I'm good at doing something. I enjoy concentrating on one specific thing, and it becomes easier when I'm good at the thing. For instance, I like playing FPS game because I can play FPS game well than other games, and it feels so good to be MVP or outstanding player in the game. 
Finally, my interests are related to each other and it makes me focus on specific topic. As I said, I like playing FPS game, but also I'm interested on guns and other military weapons. Even my favorite historical topic is WW1 ,WW2 and the Cold War. When I have free time, I play FPS game, but also watch historical video content about weapons and war history. Beacuse having interest about weapons and war makes me like playing FPS game, FPS is my favorite genre.
So far I explained why I like doing what I am good at. First, I like enjoying one certain content such as FPS game or music I like. Second, I enjoy having feeling that I'm skilled at something. Lastly, my hobbies are related to each other and it makes me be interested in certain topics."	3.0	3.5	3.5	10.0
928	Tech: Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"In nowadays, computer becomes necessary component in our life. We spent most of time with computers and computer-like electronic devices. Let's think about that how our life looks like if all those devices disappear. It will becomes some kind of disaster or like some kind of disaster movie. We cannot attend online class, use on-line shopping and delivery service and cannot use many other services. And from next section, I'll talk about computer-dependency in various regions of our life, in more detail.

  First, computers make us free from doing complex calculation or mathmatical computation task by our hand. We need to handle that kind of tasks from our every-day life (pay for buying products, etc..) to highly-technological tasks (doing research, etc..). And computers can do those tasks very fast and efficiently, so we can save our time and can develop very high-level systems that cannot be operated with only humans, that needs very fast-and large amount of computations. That means that in nowadays, most high-level human technology developed based on the use of computer. One of the feasible example of the AI (artificial intelligence), which requires a huge amount of computations. Before the computer performance is developed as high like nowadays, even if the concept of AI was proposed about 40 years ago,  it cannot be implemented. So, with computational power of computer, we can develop that kinds of new-technology, which changes our life in much more convenience way.

 The more closer example to our everyday-life is that most of our workspace need computers to be used. We need to make various papers and documents, and share those papers through web. However, without computer, it should be written by our hand, and shared by humans. Then, it requires much more manpower to do the same jobs, with slower speed. Also,  tasks that require visual representation of image will show much more quality differences.

 So, if we think that above examples without computers, our life will be much harder."	2.0	2.5	2.5	7.0

For example, my friends prefer to study with friends. He said that we can share our knowledge or opinion during study. It is helpful to study and preparing the exam. But my another friends said different. I prefer study with friends. Let me give you some reasons about it.
 First, if we study together I can concentrate more than studying alone. In my case, I play games or watch youtube and netflix when I study at my room. It is hard to concentrate for a long time. But in study cafe, library, and cafe, there are lots of people who studying. In that concentrating space, I concentrate well. Making uncomfortable environment is important for concentration. 
 Second, we can help each other by sharing our knowledge or opinions. When we study new subject first, it is difficult to understand well. For me, I learned linear mathematics first in march, it was really hard to understand it. So I shared lots of idea with my friends, then I could understanding well in mathematics. 
 I share some opinions about advantages of studying together. I prefer to study with a group of students, but it is most important to make environment which is fit to individual students."	3.0	3.5	3.0	9.5

I want to my friends sometimes correct my faults, and sometimes suggest many ways when I don't make the decision with some problems to make me better person.
 I think good friends should understand each other. I know understanding each other is difficult, but I think this is very important. Sometimes we can make fault because of wrong decision or make trouble between each other, but good friends will think about his thinking. And good friends will understand him why he must have wrong decision, and when he say sorry, good friend will get his sorry and make their friendship stronger. 
 This is selfish too, but I think good friend should make me comfortable or happy. In my case, when I hang out with my best friends, I feel comfortable when we play with anything. From we go to cafe to meet and talk to play game, balling, and billard, I feel just comfortable and happy. I want to make friends who make me feel this feelings. 
 I think this is selfish because I don't have confidence to make my friends go right way, or understand my friends, or make my friends comfortable and happy. But I do my best to be good friend. But the qualities of a good friend is different with individuals. So, I could feel that being good friend is difficult. I thought good friend that correct with qualities above doesn't live.

666	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"  Do you read the book about the people who did success in life such as mother Teresa, Yeona Kim or Jisung Park? I read a lot of stories about them from when I was young. Therefore, I realized that there is common point from their lives. The common point of people who had successful life is that they caught a big chance or overcame risks. Therefore, I agree with that successful life comes from taking risks or chances.
  The first reason of my opinion about successful life is life's uncertainty. Human lives about 80 to 100 years. In our lives, we cannot expect what will happen to us. Thus, careful planning does not make our lives successful. Careful planning is helpful for short term goal, is not helpful for long term goal like life plan. 
  There is story about the most famous soccer player of Korea, Jisung Park. Jisung Park had bad conditions for soccer player. He had flat feet, short height and he had no dribble skills like Lionel Messi. Someday, he faced the big chance. The chance is that he had a opportunity to play against the national soccer team for 2001 Sydney Olympics. Then, he got a chance. He scores in that game, and manager of the national soccer team picked him for 2002 World cup. As we know about him, he showed stunning performance in the world cup, then he went to the Manchester United which is one of the greatest soccer team in the world. The point that I want to emphasize is ability to catching the chance is very important. As Jisung Park did, some chance or some risk change our lives.
  Many founders of international company such as  Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Bill Gates took risks in their lives. In 1980s, computer and Internet is very unknown for everyone. However, they choose the way that anyone goes and made sensation to the world. The ability that taking risks is great for make life unique and successful although it is dangerous. 
  To sum up, I want to emphasize that our life is so long. To plan our whole life is not appropriate. When we live life for a long time, I believe at least one chance comes to us or at least thrilling risks comes to us. Get the chance, make your life successful. Take risks, change the world."	3.5	3.0	3.0	9.5
805	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"The Advantages of Group Studying

     Since the problem of COVID-19 increases, meeting directly has decreased. Thus, it become our life to study alone without any connection. Some students  would think this type of studying is helpful by concentrating on their own assignments deeply. However, others who have opposite idea claim that it disturbs an opportunity to share ideas. In this situation, I think studying with a group of students is more helpful than alone.
First of all, we can easily understand lessons. Let's imagine the environment of a classroom. There are a teacher who teach and introduce a new knowledge and a student who understands it. It means that we need more than two people to study the new topics. Therefore, studying with a group encourages students who get hard to understand lectures to improve knowledge effeciently.
Next, studying with students seems to become an opportunity to share ideas. I think the main purpose of groups studying is talking and debating with various people. During this activity, students can notice new opinion by sharing their own idea. Thus, if you want to be more creative, studying with around you will be helpful.
Finally, it seems to let students find new area. By studying with students who have different majors, they can find a new path to solve problems by adding diverse ideas. They would search and try in more various ways than alone. It is necessary for students to develop their own areas. So, we should increase group projects for our future.
You may think studying alone is more helpful to study, but there are many advantages of group studying. It help students to understand lectures effeciently. Also, students can share thier views so that they search new ideas themselves. For these reasons, I prefer to study and research with a group of people."	2.5	3.0	3.0	8.5

900	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"     I think going to classes should be optional for university students. Because being optional to go to classes for students is better than compelling them to attend classes for 3 reasons. 

  Firstly, any students have their own life style, compelling them to attend the class room will limit their activities. University students need various experiences like travelling, volunteer, participating internships of some companies, and so on. But if students should attend the classes, then they will be at the class during the given lecture time, which makes their outdoor activities more difficult. So, if there is a duty to attend class every time for students, students can't experience various experiences and their sight will become narrower. 


  Secondly, there are still many ways to test students who hasn't attended the classes. The professors can require to do the homework or solve a quiz  periodically. And students can send an email to the lecturers for understanding the class better. And actually, this type of asking is often better than real-time question. Because the students have enough time to write what they are curious about and can search various resources such as Internet and textbooks, which makes the content of the email more precise and readable. So, not requiring to attend class for students doesn't make checking students' understanding and communication worse than letting students attend classes.

  Finally, there can be some lectures that deals with the contents students already knows well. Some competent students often study their own textbooks by themselves. And if they studied specific chapters of the textbooks very well, attending the classes where teaching the chapter the students already understood well is wasting time for them. For such students, just let them study the textbook as they want is better. If the students think they don't understand some topics of the classes, then they will attend the classes. So, studying will be more flexible and efficient for students. 


  As 3 reasons above, I claim that students should have a right to decide whether they will attend the classes or not freely. It makes students be able to experience more things. Also, it doesn't make testing students more difficult at all. And more flexible studying will be possible by that.  So, it is better not to let students attend classes."	3.5	3.5	3.0	10.0
1134	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	I think online video lecture have some advantages versus traditional lecture. First of all, I can take part in class everywhere. I can login Zoom in cafÃ© or at home which I am. I can save some moving time that I waist time by taking bus and waking toward traditional classroom. Then I am able to use time very efficient way. For example, I can memorize some vocabulary and read some books in this short free time. And second reason is we donât have to worried about COVID-19. In online lecture we can avoid face-to-face meeting which is dangerous these days. Not only COVID-19, We can protect ourselves from colds and flus. When we think about these days high school class and high school student who learn in face-to-face traditional classroom. They should wear their mask which hide their face. Even though there are in face-to-face, they canât feel face-to-face because they canât see their friend facial expression. Third reason is we can use technical devices via online lecture such as smart phone, laptop and I pad. People who are in KAIST have leading technology and science. In this perspective, we have to use technical devices very well. So we can learn about technical devices and many online technical systems by online video class. For these reasons saving time, protect ourselves and using technical devices, there are some good point in online lectures.	3.0	2.5	2.5	8.0
1937	In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In my opinion, the most necessary condition for a good friend is helping each other when we are in trouble and never forgetting each other even though I or he/she make a great  accomplishment and is famous in some fields like science or entertainment and become far apart.
First, There are many expamples about people who abanddoned friends helping them when they are in bad situation after success. They betrayed friends and betrayal is known as the baddest thing that human can do. Someone who are betrayed might be hurted and as a result they may not trust others. This process can damage the entire society because trust is important thing  that society functions very well. Without that, remaining is distrust and because of that, the society may eventually decline.
Second, the distance. It divide people far apart but good friends are still in touch and share how they live or what we did in yesterdays. By doing that, we can relieve ourselves from hard time and earn courage to do our best in our life.
Friendship consists of trust and sharing. And these are the society's fuel. Without fuel, it cannot move."	2.0	2.5	3.0	7.5

Quailty of atomosphere, landscape, and facilities are important for determine hometown. However, the most important factor is transportation system. I will make direct subway route from my hometown to Seoul. There are two reasons why direct subway route is important.
 First of all, transportation system dicide price of house. If there is way to go Seoul fastly than other region, that region's real estate are more expensive. Also everyone heared that if the subway station is appear, price of house rise quicly. Transportation system is important because people can go office easily. Time is very import for korean because  everyone want 'fastly'. It is true that we couldn't consider time too much, but Korea will not allow. If price of our hometown is increase, hometown's people will be happy.
 In addition, transportation system bring many other system. This can be side effect of first reason, but it is different because it is also another considerable factor of region. Mosf of people don't like countryside not only for transportation but also for medical, leisure, market system. Nowadayse human always get support of various system. If someone loves food, restaurant system is important. If someone sick, medical system is important. The effect of supporting system dicide quality of life. Good transportation system like subway route reinforce all other system because of money. Management of system knows that traffic is more easier, more people visite that region, so they can get more money. If direct subway route from my hometown to Seoul is appear, everything in my hometown will be better.
 Two reasons of why direct subway route from my hometown to Seoul is best change of my hometown. One is price of house, and another is system. This wish is hard to be real, but it is not that fantasy."	4.0	3.0	2.5	9.5

"If I can change one important thing in my country, I want to change vehicle system near my home. There are three reasons why I want to change vehicle system rather than any other problems. 

First of all, there are too many cars near my home. I live in Gangseogu, Seoul, where road is too narrow. But there are many apartments and houses so too many cars drive narrow roads. So we must change our road size or make more roads.

Second, traffic lights are something wrong. I already said there are too many cars. So if you want to across the road, you need traffic lights. It make loss accidents. But, in my country, there are few traffic lights. It's dangerous to elder people and young children.

Third, people ride bicycles in the human's road. By the law, if you ride bicycle you must ride on car's road. But there are too many cars in narrow roads, so people ride bicycle in the human's road. So we need bicycle's road near our houses.

I want to change vehicle system by these three reasons. If my wish is become true, people live more comfortable."	3.0	3.0	2.5	8.5

In truth, I think people's life is important than country's life. So, I don't want to earn a lot for country. I want to use my money for my happy life. Next two sentence is about my opinion.
First, country can use money to increase people's happiness. Country's money is used in many different kind of policy like military and technology, etc. Their purpose of using are same to make happy country. So, country's money is using to make happy people. 
Second, people don't have to work a lot for country's develop. People have to pay tax to get country's service(?). If country is rich, country can decrease tax without decrease quality of policy. 
As a result, If country has a lot of money, people get money from country and don't have to work a lot for country. Then, people can use their money for their life. They can use their time to enjoy hobby and buy dream car, eat delicious food. There are many tasks to be rich country in Korea.

718	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"I would recommend him(I will refer my friend as a male, because I don't have female friend) to go on vacation. There are several reason for that.

First, he would not need the car so much. There's no need to go far or move fast. Especially during pandemic crisis, actually we don't have to go anywhere. Using public transportation like bus and subway is cheaper, healthier and also faster too.

Second, traveling is beneficial in many ways. It can widen our sights and gives us a energy. It is proved that traveling has some kind of spiritual effect on human. If there's no such inspiration, having fun and making good memories is just find too. There's no regret in vacation, but car has.

Last reason is little personal. My father once told me that I should buy a car after I get old, at least 30 years old. That's because young driver's can easily get emotional and lose concentration while driving. It's true that many people who drivers fast are young. I thought that makes sense. Driving a car can be dangerous even if he is good at it.

To sum up, there's many disadvantage in buying a car. But he won't regret if he goes on vacation. So I would strongly recommend him to go on vacation."	3.0	3.0	2.5	8.5

Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I stands for the view that ""young children should spend most of their time playing"".  I believe this is true because, children can learn variety of things while playing, which cannot be earned by beginning formal education early. He
To begin with, while playing, children can learn some values that cannot be covered by the formal education. Formal education is quite efficient in teaching  children some selected courses. However, it doesn't cover the important things that are far more valuable in the rest of the life. Some examples of such values can be honesty, sociality, confidence,  etc. One might argue that these values can be taught in formal eduaction also, but I strongly disagree on that point. These values are not learnt by the lecture, but are acquired by the natural context of the experience.    
Last and most importantly, children can find what they are interested in while playing.  Once again, formal education is quite efficient in teaching children some regular courses. However, it does not teach children what specific field to get interested in,  or how to  set a goal.  If  children starts their formal eduaction earlier, some of them may go over and over lectures what they believe as meaningless, without having a actual interest  or goal . I believe this is really dangerous. In the early age, it is very important to experience how to set goals based on their own interest, and pursue them. 
To sum up, comparing to the early start of formal education,  playing is much more valuable in the early ages. Children can learn wider range of things, and also find their interest and set goals while playing.  "	2.5	3.0	2.5	8.0

Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"In nowadays, technology has been highly developed. Following this, many companies and nations need highly educated people to innovate their techniques. Because of that, many parents want to make their children study more than others  and it causes many arguments. In this writing, I want to mention my opinion about the argument ""Which case is better between child playing and education?"". To simply say, I think former one is better and have two reasons of it. (Young children should spend most of their time playing) 
 The first reason why I thought like that is that playing is one of the way of studying. Studying doesn't mean only reading, writing, solving something. Before learning those, children need to learn how to hang out with their friends and how to communicate and collaborate each other. These learning is originated from playing.
 Second, young children whose age is about 4~7(Korean age) are not ready to go school because they are not matured. If they learn something before maturity, they will take hard time. It leads decline of interest of learning and finally causes to give up to learn difficult things such as math, foreign languages. 
 In child stage, it is much more important to learn social relationship rather than school studies. Even though I agree with some aspect why they are worried about lagging behind, I can definitely say that children should play for preparation their own future."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
2001	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"People are used to go travel to many other places, or foreigns. In addition, I like traveling too. Then why people like leave from their home?
I think the first reason is that they experience something different. In their home, there are many things people can't do. But when they leave from home, they can do the different things like sleep in the hotel, or watch the beach. 
Second, people can blow out their anxiety. When people see the nature, they will think nothing except what they see. They will not have more worries with travel.
Finally, people can exercise when they travel. For example, people in the bicycle club can go travel with bicycle. They will ride a bike when they move, and their calories will be burned.
There are so many benefits for traveling. When you have never traveled, I hope you to go travel as soon as possible."	2.5	2.0	2.5	7.0

However,  because of the surprisingly rapid growth, there are  a lot of problems that need to be fixed. One of the important thing that I think should be changed is about the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family(MOGEF). It should be abolished.
MOGEF is  the department in charge of improving women's status through women policies and working on youth and family affairs. The purpose seems to be good and therefore doesn't look like it should be abolished. However, they have caused so many controversies and don't know what the problem is. For example, they almost do nothing when the ""#METOO"" incident first happened. They had to make some policies that can protect victims of sexual assault from perpetrators, but they didn't so long time. Also, they violated the rights of teenagers through the shutdown system. This policy prevents the development of the game industry. One youth professional gamer even experienced the termination of the game during the competition. They often distort the statistics to support their opinions. They insist that the women rights of our country is in very low level using incorrect statistics. However, the level of gender equality of our country is very high.

"Recently I watched Netflix Drama which talk about laws for young students. Korea have a special laws for them. Eventhough someone who is younger than 14 years old did illegal things,  they don't get same penalty as adult. It is because,  some people think they are too young to consider and behave right way.  In my opinion, at least middle school students know everything, which is right and wrong. So, if I could change one thing about my country, I would like to reinforce laws for young students. Today, I will give my opinions and two reasons for it.
First,  they have to regret for long time. I think now a days law do not make criminals to regret. They just get volunteer work 40 hours like that. It is not enough to them to think what they did, and how their behave influence to others. Lack of regret time, they would do same things again, or getting worse.  In my opinion they have to get heavier work and time for their sins.
Second, someone who got illegal things to them or their family have to feel less sadness. When they heard students just get short time for volunteer, they feel failure. They thought or expect students to get right time in there and feel regret, sorry to them. But laws just forgive them, eventhough they didn't. 
For these two reasons, I hopefully want to change laws about boys and girls.  For someone who get illegal things to students and student's better future laws have to get heavier.  "	3.0	2.5	2.0	7.5

1868	How do movies or TV influence peopleâs behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think the age when people  watch Tv or movie  influences the result of watching so I  group people on 4 types.
1. baby(2~7)
2. child(8~13)
3. adolescent(14~19)
4. adult
I think which contents baby watches and how many times baby watches contents influence baby's character type and contents influece hobby and interest ofchild and adolescent, and lastly contents let adult relieve from other stresses.
First, the genre of movie build baby's basic character. For example, babies who watch movie of hero a lot will dream to be  people who can save other people and babies who watch movie about awesome machine or lego will be inerested in drawing schema of machine and dream to be scientests. I find out this fact by experience! I mean, I have seen friends since  I was baby and almost every baby friends get hobby and interest related with their favorite movie and TV show. Also I think If babies watch Tv a lot , then they could be used to just watching not expressing their thoght. 
Secondly, type of contents chidren watch can influence their interest and what they are doing in school. For example, children who like Tv program about animals or dinosours  are interested in raising animal and they will be interested in biology study in school.. And if children. And children who like hero movies are inetersted in saving other people, so they hang out with many friends in school, like playing sports together or do something together after school. 
Thirdly, I think adolescent can learn a lot from Tv or movie. For example, they can learn awesome words or fashion style from movie and use those at school. Maybe they can wearing like their famous actor. Also,in adolescent they wear similar with their friends. so Tv and movie could make famous style along adolescent.
Finally, I think adult watch Tv and movie for their relax in leisure time. These contents can relieve them from stresses from work or other problem. And  also I think these contents influences fashion style  they are interested in."	3.5	2.5	3.0	9.0

North ko rea is one of the most serious problems. I want to change that  when we independence  to Japan, we are not divide to north and south. There is only Korea . There are three reason.

First, there is no Korean risk . In real world,  we divided  and was doing war. Many forigen  afraid that we doing war again . So there is less travel, less  buy. In  the other hand, if Korea do  not divide, there is more less  probablity of war. Therefore, Korea can devolpe and we can live much better.  

Second, there is so many population and ground. That means there are more power in our country. More population and ground mean more resource, more scientist, engineer, writer. In resource, it is very good to devolpe region ecomomic and it can make doing something all our self. In many good people, there is some affect each other. So, Korean culture and science is more devolpe than real world.

Third, there are many culture that didn't destroy. Many culture in Korea destoried by Korean war. Korean myth don't know name of best God. If korea is not divide, there is not Korean war, So, we can see many culture of Korea.

"What would you do if you had 1 million won? There are lot's of things we can do with 1 million won. Some people would save money in the bank or some people would buy stocks. However, in my case, I would not save this money and I would use it right away. In other words, I think enjoying money is better than saving money for three reasons.
 First, we can feel happiness. In most cases, we earn money from our labor. For some people, labor may be their happiness, but for most people, labor is pain and stress. If we don't release this stress on time, our life will be ruined. Therefore we must release stress. There is a word 'Small but Certain Happiness' in Korea. For a happy and healthy life with labor, we should enjoy money to feel 'Small but Certain Happiness'.
 Second, future events are unpredictable. For example, in the future, there could be little inflation so the value of money saved in the bank may fall. Also for instance, we may not able to enjoy the money because our bad health issues. There is a Korean traditional saying about these situations. 'If you keep something too long, it would be poop'.
 Lastly, we need to learn how to spend money. My parents taught me that spending money is important as earning money. For example, we can develop ability to judge what is right consumption by using money steadily. This ability is very important because when we dont't have this ability, we can overspend our saved money at once or we can't spend any money. 
 In conclusion, I think enjoying money right away is better because of happiness, enpredictable future, and raise spending ability. I think money should be a tool to avhieve a life goal, not a goal in my l"	3.0	3.0	3.5	9.5
419	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" I believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Of course there are benefits for attending class,  however, it is not necessary. I want to suggest some reasons.

 First, almost every information is in the textbook and it is sufficient to read and solve exercises. In many classes are consists of summaries for the book. I agree that some professors give intuition for difficult concept or help students to understand complicated theories which is hard to study alone. However, some just read textbooks in the class or the delivery is too bad to listen during one and a half hour. In other case, it is possible that the lecture is nice but the style of lecture is not fit for student. Considering these possibilities, it is helpful for students to attend class optionally.

 Second, students have responsibilities for all disadvantages occur from not attending class. Therefore, if someone who know the advantages for attending and and agree with them, then that one will take class. If someone finds that there is more valuable task that class, then absent and take responsibility for one's behavior.

 For these two reasons, I believe that attending class is not necessary."	2.5	3.5	3.0	9.0

"For these days, many students are studying harder at level of high school and middle school. It sometimes look good because students can get some abilities from studying. However, it seems too much as students are studying a lot at school, academy and even their homes. Therefore, I want to change the education system of our country to become better for several reasons.
 First of all, it leaves students a lot of stress to get better grade. Because of characteristics of grading, each of students are studying harder to get higher score than their peers. For this moment, students get stress in comparing his ability with others, not solving the problems well, etc. As a result, it gives students a lot of stress of studying.
 Secondly, the purpose of studying is not going a better university,but becoming a good and smart person. In our country, students are studying a lot for going a better university. Because of their sight is limited to university, not the further future, when they go university they enjoy a lot like play games, watch movies for most of their times. Therefore, students are not studying harder at university as their high school seasons.
 Lastly, the spent money for education is too much. Many of students are going academy and some of them even go personal academy, and it spends a lot of money that even gives burden to thier home. Therefore, the cost of education of our country is too much.
 For these reasons, my opinion is the most important thing to be changed in our country is the education system. It gives student a lot of stress, a burden of spending money. Also, its purpose are moved for worse direction. "	3.0	3.0	2.5	8.5
1316	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Most of us don't know, but Korea is strong country. People don't recognize it because three huge nations are surrounding us. Thay are China, Japen, and Russia. Although they are more powerful then us, it doesn't mean that korea is weak nation. Out nation is small but it has huge amount of economic size. It means Korea is wealthy.

According to these facts, Korea is strong and wealthy country. But it doesn't mean that people in korea are satisfied in their nation. In fact, there are too many problems in this small nation. Huge distancce between normal personal and wealthy person, only huge company can survive, etc. To know why these problems are produced, we have to know our latest history.

During 1910 to 1945, Japan ate out nation and did a lot of bad things. They use their military force to get out nation's wealth. Because of them, korean nation lose a lot of money, grain, and young ang healthy people to support japan's war. Korean don't wanted this situation. Although our nation become official country again, we're economic situation was terrible. So government forced us to raise only huge company, which can raise GDP easily. It is the best way to raise GDP, but normal person can not feel this beacuse only huge company get all the money. It cause distance between normal person and wealthy person larger and small company san't survive easily.

If we can change this system, we can overcome these problems. We have to raise small size company. They can provide a lot of creativity to our market, and they can provide money to normal person. It can cause distance between wealthy person and normal person shorter. But it doesn't mean that our government have to just pour money to young CEO's. Just pouring money can cause a bad situation, such as ""Make imitation company to get money from government"". To avoid this situation, I prefer take less tax from making company and own their system. It can encourage people to make small company. If I can change country, I will do that."	3.5	3.0	3.0	9.5

" In these days, there are no person who does not use electric materials. Electric materials already come in our life. For example, we use desktop, refrigulator, electric bicycle. Like this, we use electric materials all days. But, I think people use electric materials more than necessary. So, I propose that we should use electric materials less than now. 
 Then, why should we use less electricity ?
 I think it have the most important reasons. That is fossil fuels. Electricity is made by fossil fuels. Than, what problem can cause by using fossil fuels ? There are two problems. First problem is changing weather. The temperature of Earth is more increasing by using fossil fuels. It can cause melting ice in polar and also kill many polar animals like polar bear. And, our summer is more and more hotter. So, we should use less fossil fuels for not changing weather. The second reason is that earth don't have a lot of fossil fuels. The amount of fossil fuels is limited. In the future, people don't have the fossil fuels and find another resources. So, we save fossil fuels for the future. 
 In conclusion, there are two reasons why I think we should use electric materials less than now. First one is changing weather and second one is limited amount of sources. So, I think we should use electric materials less than now.  "	3.0	3.0	2.5	8.5
847	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Many students, not limited on university, hate to attend every classes. Some of them may says it should not be forced, 
but even they know it is actually required. Here are some reasons that we have to attend classes.


First of all, one of the most important duty of the students is understanding lectures. To do so, not only just looking at the book is enough,
but also ask questions to professors is needed. No one can understand the knowledge of all courses through the textbook only. We should
dicuss with others, and actually it is hard to do spontaneously without attending classes. Therefore, in terms of the duty of the students, 
attending classes should be required.


Furthermore, attending classes is related to respect professors. Imagine no one has attened to the classes, while professor prepared the lecture
a lot. Since teaching is not his main job,  it is quite rude actions if we don't attend the classes.  I think everyone will agree that university which
professors are not respected cannot be major university.  If so, to prevent honor of the university, paying respect to professors via attending classes
should be required.

Finally, for students' life cycle, attending classes can affect positively. University students are easy to wake up at afternoon and sleep at the morning 
because of their homeworks and projects. This is very bad to their health and hard to turn back. However, if they have to attend the classes, they will
manage their schedule and sleep at least few hours. Even though it is not the best, this is an optimum between their health and duty of students.
So, to manage students' health, forcing students to attend classes is a good way.

To sum up, students should be required to attend classes for not only students' health and study, but also professors and universities' honor.  "	3.0	3.5	3.5	10.0
1217	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are many good student in the world. But, I think a good student participates class actively. I mean participating class actively is such as ask some question, discuss with classmate or teacher(professor), not sleeping and want to understand the class. Many people do join the class, but not participate it. They only want to get attendence score, so they go class and spend time thinking other things or sleep! 
If all of students do each of individual's work like assignment while professor or teacher do lecture, that would be very stressful to professor or even worse than not having a class. I think the more student participate in class, the more they get in class. When they actively participate the class, they ask more question or discuss more about some problem. So, they will be better in the future. So, I think 'participating the class' is one of the qualities of a good student.
And I have one more qualities of a good student, and that is truth. A good student is very truthful, so they tell people what they mistake, or some accident.
So they are easy to fix their problem. "	3.0	3.0	2.5	8.5

"After TV was invented, many video contents like movie, Drama, TV show and News developed a lot.  And now we use mobile phone or Tablet to watch video contents through Netflix and YouTube. So I think people influenced a lot from TV or movie. 
First, people are sensitive to trend. people want to belong to group. So if they don't know trend, they can't belong to large group. Because in group we need to use meme or trend expression. I think movies and TV provide these trends. For example after 'ê·¹íì§ì'  become popular, many people find 'ìì ìê°ë¹ íµë­'. Because 'ê·¹íì§ì' provided a trend, 'ìì ìê°ë¹ íµë­'. And if an actor wear a clothes,  many people want to buy that. These are evidences the TV and movie influence people's behavior.
Second, TV programs are provocative. TV show need many viewers because they earn money through Advertisements. So they make more provocative contents. For example Japan made much provocative contents like horror or gag. people attracted from strong stimulus. Because the behavior in TV show are different with reality. So people get curious on TV and they replicate it. 
In conclusion many people influenced from TV program. But TV show try to make more provocative contents. If we replicate all behavior in Tv, Society will be confused. So we need to control ourself. "	3.5	3.5	2.5	9.5

 Second, ourdays war will be scientific war. Then soldier's number  is not most import thing.
 Third, 18 months are very very long.

Thanks to this movie, I have had dream that is to go space. Like me, I think almost people watched many movies, and they are affected by movies and TV. How do movies or TV affect people?
 First, I think movies or TV help people decide their future. We can see lions that live in Africa or famous people who live in other countries at our home through TV or movies. Like this, movies and TV serve various experiences. These expeeriences make us get interested in various works. In the result, we can have a dream like my case.
 In addition, TV give us various news almost simultaneously when events happen. For example, we can get news that far country is damaged by storm, so we can donate for them. People bring their umberlla because they saw the wheater cast that said ""It will be rain in evening"". TV serve many news related with us and make us behave.
 Unfortunately, TV or movies sometimes influence people in the bad way. Many teenagers mimic violences that are the movie scenes. People often see the violent scene through TV or movies, they could be not to cionsider the violences seriously.
 To sum up, I think TV or movies influence people in various ways. They sometimes help people decide their future and serve various events around the world. But they could work in bad ways, they could justify violence and make people mimic the violent scenes. "	3.5	3.0	3.0	9.5

"Let me tell you about my preference of studying. Actually, I prefer to study with a groupd of students than study alone.  There are several reasons why I want to do group-study.
At first, it is harder for me to concentrate on what I study when there are no person around me. Because I suddenly think a lot about unnecessary things, it is not adequate to study alone. I always start to think about strange things like where to travel, friends, family, and me. But when I'm with my friends, their presence make me concentrate better.
Secondly, we can help each other when we study together. There are many subjects and the things I'm good at and things my friends good at usually differ. So, I can help other friends study and he also can help me. And, when we need to think about creative ideas, it is better to think together. For example, when I was writing some report and was suffering by lack of idea, my friend help me imagine some reasons.
Lastly, we can be more familiar by studying together. Most of the people think that friends are people that we play with. But I think it is not good to just spend time on playing. Rather, I believe that we can be more familiar by spending boring time and doing what we don't want to-since I usually don't want to study. And also, it is more interesting to do something together.
In conclusion, I prefer to study together with my friends for the three reasons. To concentrate more, to help each other, and to be more familiar with friends. Because of the virus, I couldn't study in groups in the first semester, but I want to study together in this semester."	3.0	2.5	2.5	8.0
1255	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think that their are three advantages of taking online courses in college.
first, if we take a online class, we can get more leisure time than taking offline class.
in college, we should move lecture room when lecture starts. but in online class, we don't have to move around in interval of classes.
that means we can have the time which can make us to make a question or to take a rest.

second, we can make morning confident.
in the morning, we always feel ""i want to sleep five minutes more"".
in some online class , we don't have to turn on the camera.. so when they feel they need more time to sleep, using time which they wash, they can sleep more  we can take a more sleep. as a result we can feel confident morning

finally, we can use our time useful.
some classes are non-realtime. so if our class is full and there is a reason that we can not take a real-time class, like visiting hospital or taking army body checking (ì ì²´ê²ì¬?) , we can choose the time to do the reasons when non-realtime classes. like the example, non-realtime class make our time flexible.

but their are several disadvantages of taking online courses like freshman can not make their college friend and mother's eye like eagle.

although , what i want to say in this essay is that there is a problem which make offline class impossible, so let's talk about the positive aspect of the online class."	2.5	3.0	2.0	7.5

I know that how sentence is big and rate of crime have not a great relation, but I think people come to understand about the sentence. Also I think department of justice in our country care of public opinion. I think it is a problem because department of justice should keep their own criteria of sentence, not a public opinion. When they care of public opinion, unfair sentence may occur. Public opinion cannot be professional to sentence and I think public opinion is too emotional. So I think department of justice should clarify the sentence. For these reasons, if I could change one important thing about our country, I would change, reinforce, clarify the sentence.	2.5	2.5	2.0	7.0
740	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I strongly agree with the opinion that university students should be required to attend classes. There are two main reasons for this. First, without attending class, students can't get high-quality knowledge he want to get. Second, every calss has its own curriculum so absence can affect on student's learning.

 Why we go university and take lectures? It's because we want to study and learn about what we want. So every semester, we choose and register the lecture courses and participate in the coure throughout the semester. In this aspect, what will happen if student do not attend classes? A lot of things can happen, but I will talk about especially two stituations.

 First of all, students will fail to learn whole, well-organized knowledge. Let's say a male students is learning about math or physics. Althoungh he does not attend several times, maybe he could get information about terms and their concepts or some formulas he need. But, those are not complete knowledge. Rather, those are just some fragments of knowledge. We don't know what he did in his class time, but we could anticipate that he will require much more time than attending class and taking lecture to get knowledge exactly.

 Second, whatever lecture students take, it must have its curriculum and schedule. So if students optionally go to class, both student and lecturer can be affected negatively. If the lecture is kind of student-participating presentation class, it would much more worse. For lecturer, she(or he) would feel difficult to prepare every day classes and to lecture for right precess. And, for students, they can't keep up with other students in same class, so it can cause learning gap between these two group of students.

For these two reasons, I emphatically agree about university students should be required to attend classes, not optionally take the class."	3.5	3.5	3.0	10.0
1866	How do movies or TV influence peopleâs behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Do you think movies or TV can influence people's behavior? My answer is ""YES"". I want to start with telling my experience about it. First, I don't like watching movies and TV nowdays. However, my 13 years old cousin likes to watch TV. He always watches TV when he is in home. I realized how TV make my cousin to go wrong way. I'll talk about it.

 First, it make people addicted. I agree this very much. When I was young, I didn't watch TV. I liked to play with my friends and make robots. However, after I started to watch TV. I noticed that TV is much funnier than playing with my friends, making robots and resfing books. TV makes  me sit at sofa and watch TV almost of time. The interesting thing is, my cousin is doing same thing when i was addicted to TV. He is getting worse. When I was his age, I go to math academy and taekwondo academy. However, he is at home everyday and only watches TV. I was very sad when I see that.

 Second, it makes people agressive. I think this is the most opinion when we discuss about this topic. Action movies or fighting scene in TV animation make people more agressive. Someone who watches action movies like to  simulate same thing in real life. It can make someone hurt or if it is so though,  someone can die. 

 Lastly, movies or TV not always make people's behavior worse. Some movies give some lesson,  some TV programs talk about attitude. I had a lesson from some movie. I don't watch movie but watch review. The movie <Terminal> gives me lesson that we can do any thing if we have passion to it. So, I tried to do that I wanted to do whether it success or fail. 

 To sum up, movies or TV influence people's behavior. It can influence good way or bad way. It needs controll not to go bad way. Thank you for reading!"	3.0	3.0	3.0	9.0
181	Some prefer to study alone.Â Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Â 	"I think 'efficiency' is the most important thing in study. The efficiency can be maximized when I study with lots of students. So I prefer to study with a group of students for two reasons.

First, I can learn something more when I study with a group of students. For example, there is similar kind of study called 'tutoring'. I did tutoring last year.
In tutoring, I can understand what I didn't know in the lecture. Also, I can ask tutor about difficult part or interesting part. By tutoring, I got a good grade in math.
Also, I can notice which I don't know by discussing with each other. Knowing what I don't know is important in study. I can absorb most part of my learning. 

Second, I won't be lazy. When I study alone in my home, I didn't concentrate on my assignment well. Because there is less stress than study with many people.
So I watched 'youtube' and 'facebook'. However, when I study with a lot of students I have more stress than studying myself. So I can focus my study well.
Also, there is some competence like I want to study more than he or she. Due to these things, I think studying with many students will enhance our efficiency of study.

In conclusion, I like to study with a group of students for two reasons. I think we can increase our efficiency of study by studying with lots of students."	3.0	3.0	3.5	9.5
1162	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"There are two types of lecture. And I think watching online video lectures are better than viewing live
lectures in a traditional classroom. There are three advantages of online video lectures.
First at all, the online video lectures can be replayed. In a traditional classroom they canât take the
lectures two times, although they canât understand. And they canât take lectures again at test period.
But in video lectures they can repeat how much they want. In my case it is very helpful to study.
Because my notetaking speed is very late, I often miss the important information. But in video
lectures, I donât.
Second reason is that, in video lectures, students can study whenever they want. All of students
have different schedules and lifestyles. So the time that they can concentrate on the study mostly is
different, someone could feel better at morning, and another could like nighttime. If they watch video
lectures, they can choose time to study and they can make best efficiency.
And Finally, it can remove the restrict of traditional classroom, like space and method. In classroom,
because there are many students, someone should sit far and canât listen the professorâs voice well.
Also, if they are any question, they canât use internet or other information method freely. But in video
lectures, they can use diverse method, and search information immediately. I think that students find
solution themselves is very good way of studying.
For these reasons, I think watching online video lectures have many advantages, and it can replace
some disadvantages of the traditional lectures. If we mix two types of lectures well, it will make good
results."	3.0	3.0	3.0	9.0
551	You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Â 	"As the semester begun, there is some issues about the roommate of dormitory rooms. If you do not choose your own roommate, you would meet a student who is assigned by university. The student may be gentle, friendly, and may become a best friend later. However, you and your roommate may also have a trouble with the room condition. Hence, I'd rather choose my won roommate when I get this situation. 

 The random roommate is random. It means that I cannot choose his characteristics.  For example, I have a friend who have a university assign student to share room with him. He got a roommate who did not clean his room for more than 3 months. He got a lot of stress and finally clean his roommate's trashes, bed, and desk. He told me that it is not easy to clean the things that he didn't messed up. From this story, I've learned that random doesn't always means good and may be bad.

 Also, you can be real friend with your own roommate. If you become a roommate with your friends, then you may live him with at least 8 hours a day. You will know his small habit which you didn't recognize before. As time pass by, you will understand what your friends want to say, even if your friends don't tell you and just pointing something. It is very meaningful to get someone who understand you and this may be the great chance to get him.

 Of course there is one who want to meet a new roommate and be friend, but for me to be friend with strange is not an easy activity to do.To talk with someone who is not close to me is also not an easy thing. Since we live together, there may be a situation that I should ask him to do something but it will give me tons of stress and that situation may be very stressful. 

 University is a place to meet a new friend but the dormitory room is a place that we take a rest and should be the best place to find peace. However, if I choose the random roommate, many issues can happen and will be not a peaceful place  to take a rest. For these reasons, I would live with my own roommate."	3.5	3.0	3.5	10.0
767	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Some people prefer to study alone because they do not have to fit their schedules in group members' schedules and they can take a rest when they want. However, I think  studying with other students is better for two reasons.

The first reason is that students who study with group members can earn lots of knowledges  which they are not in major. When I was in the high school, I studied with my friends to get good grade in final exam. I was good at physics and math, but I did not have any deeply knowledge in chemistry, and biology. On the other hand, one of our group members was good at chemistry, and another group member was good at biology. Therefore, we divided the group study time into 2 parts. In the first time, we studied our major subject to make other group members understand easily. Then, we stduied other subject and ask questions to other group member who is in major that subject. Through this group studying, I earned lots of knowledges in chemistry and biology, and I got the best grade in these subjects.

The second reason is that students can make good relationship with their group members. When student study alone, they might feel lonely and difficulty to make new friends. Meanwhile, when students make therir own study group and study with group members many times, they should know deeply each other and can make friendship with them easily. In my case, I was very shy, so I did not make a new friend easily when I was in middle school. However, I joined the study group in the highschool, and my group members help me to make friends. They call me when they play their classmates. Thanks to them, I usually meet my same highschool friends when I want to play with them. In addition, group study help students when they go to college. There are lots of group activities in almost whole class in college, so experience of group study help students to make friends and participate in group project easily.

With group study, students can earn ohter majors knowledges deeply and make good relationship with other people. Therefore, I prefer to study with group members."	3.0	3.0	3.0	9.0
380	Some people think that children should begin their formal education at a very early age and should spend most of their time on school studies. Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I agree that the children should spend most of their time playing. There are 3 reasons. First of all, in whole life, there is very enough time to studying. Especially, if you get old, you may have lot of remaining time to do something. You can study at that time. Also at that time, you can study what you want so you can enjoy studying. However  most of children do not know what they want to know or study. This is second reason. Childern just study something they do not want to know because someone such like parents want they study hard and get a good grade. So they study without their own willingness. It implies that large portion of children do not want to study. In real case, when I was young, most of my friends do not want study. So the memory when they young become bad memories. Everyone knows that memory of young time is very important in whole life because it can affect their job, hobby and even future. So at that time children should do various experiences to make good memory and find their way of life. But only studying can gives only bad memories and bad effects to children. Conversely, playing implies various things so it can give good memories and good effects to them. So they should spend most of their time playing. Last reason is that if you get old you cannot spend time playing even though you want to because of your body condition. Human's body is getting old and old rapidly. So if you get old, your body also get old and finally you cannot do some playing which demands physical requirements. So you should play something when you are young. Those are 3 reasons that yound children should spend most of time playing. Only studying cannot make good adults. It just reduce way of life. 
However, playing can increase the way of life. So I recommend you to make your children spending lot of time playing."	2.5	2.0	2.0	6.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Â 	"Until graduating high school, I didn't need to choose what to do. I just did what teachers said, I just followed what my parents told me to. I just followed school schedule and doing hard, that was all I had to do. But after graduating from high school, my circumstances have changed. I should choose what to do in my free time. There were not many options to choose, but only two options, harder and painful one or easier and exciting one. For last 6 months, I mostly choose the latter. I played Lol in my free time not studying although I need a lot of extra work. I didn't think deeply on math and physics assignment but asked to my friends whenever I faced questions that needs focus and effort. I didn't focus on classes but I slept during the lecture. For spring semester I only choosed easier one. Then my first college vacation started, one day of my summer vacation I retrospected my spring semester. I asked myself, 'what did you do?', 'what is left now?'. I answered, 'nothing'. I realized that I lost my 4 month in kaist because I made easy choices. After that I promised myself to choose hard one whenever I have to make choices. 
 'Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer?', it is a easy question for me if I can tell which is hard one and which is easy one. Let's find which one is harder. Before that, I will set the boundary for meaning of study. Study should be the thing that group study is optional not the one that study together is apparently better. It means that you don't necessarily study alone also you don't necessarily study with a group. In this circumstances I think study alone is hard one and better one. Study need long term thinking which is very painful and hard but in the end that makes me stronger. Study together can share that pain with your group members , you probably think deeper than think and study alone and you might get a better score. But still I think I should choose harder one. Choosing harder one not always make your score higher and your work better, mostly opposite. But I'm sure that it makes you better and stronger and it makes your score and work higher and better in the end."	2.5	2.5	3.0	8.0
841	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" Have you ever taken classes in university? In university, in general, most of classes check students attendance, but few don't. Many professors think student must attend all classes, but I have different oppinion. Student can choose they will attend the class or not. There are three reasons. First, students have abilities to decide. Second, it would increase quality of lectures. 
 First, students in University are adults, and  they have responsibility ro decide their attendance. They are all adults and they know what would happen after they absent on class such as sufferring on studying or getting lower grades.  I think student must learn how to response on their choicese in University.
 Second, some students who attend the class by forces may disturb the class. There are some students who sleep, talk, and even play games. These can interupt students who are willing to listen lecture. So, it is better to not force students to come to class, and let some students can abscent on the class.
 For these reasons, I believe attending to classes should be optional for university students."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

1273	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  Many company leaders or high-level company members in Korea are doing their best to accomplish their jobs and get the highest revenues. But in the process of pursuing such achievements they often behave badly to their subordinates and hurts their emotion. They also often do not understand or forgive one-time mistake of the members in lower positions. This kind of behavior is one of many factors which degrades the morale of many employees in Korea and even gives a bad image about the country to many new-bies in Korea.

  Although I am currently not in a high position in any company, not even a company employee, I believe I can change such harsh environment of my country in the future. I am basically generous to anyone. I have not make revenge to anyone who directly or indirectly hurt me, but just tried to understand why they were hurting me and which aspects of mine caused such events. For example, when I was a 11-th grade student I had some senior students who behaves badly and sometimes gave insulting words to lower-grade students, including me. At first I did not understand why there doing in such way and felt a sad feeling about my destiny. But soon I realized that they were stressed out due to the preparation of the university entrance exam, so I decided not to care much about their actions. I am also able to quickly discharge the bad emotions and hatred arising in my mind. For example, I had a friend who once spreaded a false and bad information about me to his friends. I became really angry just after I noticed the incidence, but I did not fully express the anger to him. Instead, I decided to take a nap and within two hours I returned to my ordinary emotional state. As a result, there was no serious happening at the time; it just ended with a mild warning directed to my friend.

  Although my generous personality will not directly change my country, I believe that when I obtain a high position in a company many followers and colleagues will be affected by my behavior and then make gradual effects in the company, society, and the country."	2.0	3.0	4.0	9.0

1785	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" If I could change one thing of our university, I want to change the process of registerating lecture using KAIST site. In our university, we register the lecture that we want to take on the next semister before the semister start. I want to change this process because it has a lot of error. I'll give reasons below.
 First, because KAIST has many students, a server of the KAIST site is getting hardship of accepting all students to register a lecture. It results in broken down server. So, when I try to access on KAIST site and register a lecture, the server is broken down in few minuite, and we have to wate 1  hour, or more, untill the server is rebuilded and register a lecture that I want. In this point, we can think that it's natural for university that has many students, but my brother, attending another university, doens't have some error when he register a lecture. In other word, broken down server is not a usuall phenomenom. We have to change the process of registerating lecture to solve this error.
 Second, the process of registeration is random, and it can make some students hard to achieve the need of KAIST's rule. By the rule, we should get at least 12 points in 1 semister, but since the process is all random, some students' registeration can all be declined. I really saw a student that failed to join all of the lecture he wanted. If it happens, the student  must fill 12 points at class changing season, but it's hard to join the class since almost all  classes are filled, and just a few left. Also, it's hard to arrange time of the classes in our flavor. So, I think it's not a good and fair process for everyone.
 For these reasons, I think the process of registerating lecture is not efficient and fair for all students, so if i could change one thing, I should change it."	3.0	3.0	2.0	8.0

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"Challenge is one of the most important concept explaining history of developing humanity. There were a lot of people taking risks to get honor, wealth, new knowledge during human era. However, nowadays happiness of individual is getting more and more important due to the change of lifestyle, so many people say that we can live a better life by doing only what we already do well. Despite of this debateful topic, I strongly prefer to try new things and take risks. Two columns, experience and amusement will support my idea.
 We can accumulate various experience when we try new things. We face new people, new place and new task when we attempt new things we didn't do before. Thanks to our brain is trained to memorize things we never met, we can get more knowledges and experiences through various challenges. Broadened experience leads to see the world more widely, which is very important living this global era. For example, I know a student who just study at home and another student having a lot of experiences such as entering contests and volunteering. The later student become a CEO of a company due to his various experiences, however the former student is having a hard time having a job because he doesn't have wide eyesight.
 Also, we feel joy when we challenge new things we didn't ever tried. If we only do restricted tasks, then we will feel bored though the task is what we do well. However, if we try fresh activities out of daily routine, then our brain will be stimulated and make dopamine, so that we will be amused. Also, taking risk is very thrilling, so we will be more happier when we succeed our challenges. When I study all day, though I am good at study, I get bored when I do same thing long time. However when I go out and do something else like climbing mountains, then I feel fresh and happy.
 Some might say we can be relaxed and be cozy when we get inside of our 'routine bubble'. However, as I stated, I strongly argue that we have to pop the bubble and broaden our experience and feel fresh joy rather than boring coziness."	3.0	2.5	2.5	8.0
1855	How do movies or TV influence peopleâs behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are many kinds of entertainments or hobbys that people enjoy in their free time. And the kind of video information like movies or TV program are the most popular thing that people enjoy. This means many of people spend their time by watching these kind of videos and videos influence their usual life easily. Now a days, youtube is the most famous and popular flatform for sharing and watching videos online. And the youtuber who has many subscriber is considered as famous star. The kind of video like movies, TV programs or youtube video form a culture of social community. And it differ to region, men or women and age. The flow of video information form culture of community and react with people's behavior. 
For example, 'mukbang', food eating video, is the kind of famous concept of video recently. Many of TV program and youtube video contains food information and eating video and these videos are popular regardless of region, sex and age. Some of people want to go to the restaurant where they have seen in TV program and they recommend it to other people to go. This is the example that video contents influence people's eating culture. 
The other example is video can change people's speaking culture. There are a lots of video for fun and some of them contains new words or kind of sentence that is called as 'meme'. When the meme become very popular, many people use it when speaking in their ordinary life with others and some TV programs begin to use it in their programs to not to lose people's interest. We can easily realize the speaking culture change by surfing the internet and comparing with TV program of 10 years ago and that of recently made. 
But there is also speaking culture diffrence with age. Because of difference of video watching habit between young and old people, the speaking culture of young and old people are very diffrent and even older people cannot understand younger poeple's speaking. It is obvious that interest for young and old are very different. And this result in speaking culture change differently by age. "	2.5	2.0	2.5	7.0
710	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"  How to spend money is always a big issue for everyone. There are various choices to spend money, and each person have to choose only a few choices. If a friends of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car, I will suggest to go on vacation. There are some reasons why I suggest to go on vacation.
   Firstly, going on vacation can give some valuable experiences. Since almost everyone feels tired and has a difficult time during working or studying in daily life, they need some time to relax, go to a new place and meet new peoples. For doing this, they will be able to stress out and  experience something new. Going on vacation can be one way to refresh their life. 
   Someone might be say that buying car is better since they can use that car for such a long time; for about 5 years even more. However, they have to spend more money for using car; for oils, washes, repairs, and so on. That is the second reason why I suggest to go on vacation. Car is required more money to use not only the exact price of the car. On the other hands, in case of going on vacation, it is not required any extra money. This facts will be important for most of the students.
    For those reasons which are stated, going on vacation is a way to refresh and is not required extra money, I would suggest to go on vacation rather than to buy a car.  "	3.5	3.5	3.0	10.0
776	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I prefer to study with a group of students. While I study alone, mostly the studying environment is very quiet. No one can bother me while I memorize what I have learned in the lecture, or do my homeworks. This means that I can concentrate more on my study. 
   But while I study with my friends, I can ask them about the problems that I don't know the exact reason or answer. We can debate about it. During the debate, I can hear my friends' opinions, which contain things that I don't know well. Or I can have a new point of view. Plus, I have to use the things I learned to make an opinion. I have to remember about the lecture contents, mix them logically into an opinion to tell my friends that I'm right. This not only leads me to new knowledge and more interest, but it also makes what I have learned into a long-term memory.
    For example, when I was in highschool, we had a biology test. There were so many scientific words and theories about our body and nature. I had questions about ETC(Electron Transferring Chain) - things like how the proteins move the electrons, what molecular structure they had. Of course I read Campbell(biology textbook) again and again, only to check what I already know. I asked this to my friends in biology seminar. We used more textbooks that we had privately, debated it for an hour, and made conclusions. Though I forgot several things in biology, I clearly remember about this topic and what I have learned. 
    In conclusion, both ways of studying are useful in memorizing contents. But if I study alone, there must be something that I don't know exactly. And I can't solve this problem alone. On the other hand, if I study with a group of students, I can learn more about the contents by listening to other people's opinions. I can also ask and check that what I know is right. That is why I prefer to study with a group of students."	2.5	2.5	3.0	8.0
1213	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Nowadays many people go on a trip to other cities or countries. And I think there are various reasons that people go o a trip. What is the charming point of travel? I will write about that.

First, people can get new sight.
 When we go on a trip, we eat new food, see amazing view and talk with people in that area. In these process, people can get new sight because new cultures teach us creative methods or feeling. we couldn't get these sight, if we were stay at home. It has limit to get knowledge from media. To see and feel directly is much better than learn from book or TV. Feeling from travel may be quite different with learn from media. So people go on a trip to confirm their knowledge form media and feel something special.

Second, people want to escape from boring life.
 Usually, people do work or study everyday hard and get stressed out from these boring life. So when they get long holidays, they want to escape usual life. When people go on a trip, they don't have to work, study and clean. They can do everything they want to do. During travel, people can remove stress and think about their worries. It can refresh their mood and soul. So they can restart their job when they back to boring life."	2.5	3.0	3.0	8.5

FIrst, my country, South Korea, was devided into 2countries, NORTH and SOUTH, and still devided now on. From that, many people had hard time. It tortured people in the past and still torturing  and even our childrens will be tortured because of that memory or history.  My grandma and grandpa was involved in ""6.25 war"".  The war that was evoked in June 25th. My Grandma was the nurse and grandpa was a soldier.  When I was like 10years old, i remember nothing about things i did in age 10, but i remember one thing. The story about 6.25 war from my grandma and grandpa. It seemed like they were really scared at that time.  Everyday was like hell to them and some still feel scared. For example, when i was in high school I volunteered in a hospital. In the hospital there was a grandmother who shakes if she hears loud noise cause of the memory of grenades and bombs. Like this, people has trouma becuase of the memory in the past. Being devided has no advantage. Bad memory, horrible things. money for military, men going to the military. Everyday every second, we have to be nervouse and cautious. So I want to change the history so we could gather, North and South.

Second, my country was civilized by Japan. And my grandma was about 18years old at that time. She said that some bunch of Japan soldiers came and said they will give good foods and money so follow us. My grandma did not follow them. She said she was so lucky. Now, we know that Japan soldiers took Korean girls to use them for sexual slaves. From that one sentence she said, I could feel how scary that situation would be. Like this, many people have big trouma from that civilization such as 6.25.war.



In conclusion, for these two reasons I want to change the history of our country. Thank you for reading."	2.0	2.5	3.0	7.5

We know about many place to spend the weekend, but mountain is the best place to spend the weekend.

    A mountain is a natural place. First, spending the weekend at the mountain is environment friendly activity.  We can enjoy many things without destroying nature things. Second, the nature is a place which provides many ideas. For example, we got a lot of ideas in nature, and we are imitating many things in nature when we make many arcitectures. Like this example, we can get many ideas when we climb mountain. Thus, climbing the nature is good activity when we spend the weekend.

    Moreover, climbing mountain is healthy activity because we should walk long time when we climb mountain. In these days, many people usually don't do exercise because they are busy or exercising regularly is too hard, but climbing mountain can provide a chance.    

    Furthermore, we can talk about family and friends long time when we climb mountain together. These days, talking time with other people is decreasing because of many digital devices. For instance, if we don't have a computer or a cell phone,  we  usually talk with family when we eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner. But, we often do not talk with family  when we eat because we use a cell phone in this time.  So, these days, we need to increase talking time. When we climb mountain together, we talk about many different things in our life because we distant with many works. 

    In conclusion, climbing mountain is environment friendly, and healthy activity. And we can talk about family and friends long time when we climb mountain.
So the best place to spend the weekend with family and friends is a mountain."	3.0	2.5	3.0	8.5

732	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"In my opinion, Going to classes should be optional for students. 
Because, attending classes is up to our responsibility. when we don't attend class, we get penalty. If you don't attend class, you should prepare the penalty and have the responsibility on your doing. So, there are optional, you attend class or fail the class. And I think there are no students who pick the later one. 
Second reason is that there are 'University' students, not 'High school'. In Korea, the standard of adult is 20 years old above. So, there are big difference between high school students and university students. In High school, we must go to high school classes. Also, classes are not picked by ourselves. But, when we 20 years old and university students, we just choice the classes what you like. So, most important thing is 'free to choice' when we are university students. Because of this reason, I think going to classes are also part of 'free to choice'.
Lastly, when we look at most of syllabus, there are no contents about 'students should be required to attend class.' only contents about penalty if you miss the class. For example, If you miss the class more than 3 times, you fail the class. This means that going to classes should be optional for students.
So, because of this three reason, University students should choice whether attend classes."	3.0	2.5	2.5	8.0

There are two reasons of my opinion.
   First of all, we can use our money for accident things in the future. We don't know what will happen in the future. We may have car accident, or may go to the hospital accidently in the furture. If we use our all money-not saving, we can't pass that things easily. Secondly, there are many circumstances, which we should use our money. As we grow, we should spend our money for other people and ourselves. If our friends are going to marry, then we should give money to him/her to celebrate. If I want to marry with someone, I need a lot of money. If I need car to go somewhere, I need money. Therefore, we need to save our money for some time.

2203	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"KAIST Should Build More Club Rooms
  I think during attending college period, students have to do not only study hard their major, make lots of experiences and good memories too. In that point of view, one of the most important activity that can do at university is club activity, because students usually build a community in their and almost all good memories are came from there. To reach that purpose more well, one thing that KAIST should do is to build more number of club rooms for following two reasons.
  First, existence of the own club room enlarge the club's activity. I know that there are many clubs that does not have their own club room or share their room with other club. In that situation, those clubs have to find some places that their main activity that frequently be done, because they do not have club room for that in school or always have to make a deal with other club sharing their club room. This hardness of finding proper place forbid coming out of new clubs and acting club activities.
  Second, own club room is essential for building friendship in the club. In my experience, I joined two clubs that one has their own room and the other has not.  At the club has their own room, it was so easy to make a friends in their, because whenever I go to the room, there is at least one member who just playing at there. So, every club members go there when they have a free time, and there is not much time needed for all members know each other. On the other hand, other club I joined has a sharing club room. Therefore, we must careful for interrupting other clubs activities, while only three days a weak are given to our club. It is obvious that we spend much more time and money to meat each other at other place more frequently. 
  In conclusion, without own club room, the club is too hard for making friendship within members and active more frequently and fun based on that friendship. I know that KAIST have been spending much money to build freshmen community through a few programs such as Fun College Life class. At this time, I think that activate the club activity is more efficient way. Therefore, If there is one thing that be changed at KAIST, that is building more club rooms."	4.5	4.0	4.0	12.5

However, to the contrast, there are generations who can't follow the speed of development of computer. These mainly consists of older people. They feel stressful and struggled to the electrical devices and even some of them says the life before the computer was more efficient to treat. Why this unbalanced situation happens?
  Above all, it is because of the education. For the new generation, there is a class to teach how to treat computer in the elementary course. This lecture helps students get accustomed to the computer and easily react to the newly invented techniques. Also, they faced the computer from early years, it is natural that they are surrounded by the computer.
  However, it is totally different to older generations. For them, there was no education about computer. In addition, since they were already accustomed to the way of manly treated tasks, it was a challenge for them to change their way of life. The gap between life before computer and life after computer increases dramatically, and at that result, these old generation became the computer il-literal.
  To sum up, for the new generations who got a continuing and intensive education of computer feel comfortable with computer and agree to computer makes life easier. But, to the old generation, who didn't get the education of computer, computer is too difficult and complex tools. It is clearly true that computer makes the things impossible before possible and the computer will not disappear foresight. Therefore, the social supports not only for new generation but also for old generation should be focused to decrease the computer il-literacy."	1.5	2.0	2.5	6.0
1137	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"Iâll introduce the advantages of watching online video lecture first and that of
viewing live lectures in tradition classroom next.
There are 2 advantages of watching online video lectures. First, online lecture
has less restriction in time and space. Because the online lecture use internet
for its medium, we can watch the lecture in any space and any time (except for
some live-zoom classes. ). So this can increase convenience of attending
lecture. Second, we can repeat the lecture. If we watch the recorded lecture
that is posted in website, we can adjust the speed of lecture. We can pause or
repeat the lecture until we understand.
By the way the live lecture in classroom also has 2 advantages. First, it is easy
for that kind of class to contact with other people like students, professors etc.
Because if we go to school and listen the lecture, we do some activities like
projects, presentations and group discussion. And also we can meet the others
after the class to hang out. These points can make new connection between
the others and us. Second, because of that new connection, we can study in
more efficient way. By meeting the classmate and discussing about some
topics about the lecture we can understand contents of the lecture more deeply.
And when we have some problem in studying, we can ask them for help!
In this short wrinting, I introduced the advantages of watching lectures in online
class or traditional live classroom. Thank you for reading. :)"	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
775	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	" All students have their own studying methods and skills. Some students  like studying alone better, and other students like studying together with their friends much more. Each method has their own advantages, but In my case, i like studying  by making teams more. There are three reasons for it.
   First reason is that i can learn what i didn't know from  people whom i'm studying with. Although i listened the class carefully and study hard alone, something that i don't know or understand exists. When we study toghether, there is a probability that someone knows this. 
   Second reason is that i can get the mind of improvement.  When i study alone, i do not study hard. Because there is  no other people who are studying around me. So i don't want to study either and play with phone. However, when i study with a grop of students, there are many people who are studying around me. Therfore, i aslo begin to study too.  Aslo i have Desire to get better grades than other people, so seeing other peolple studying is good motivate to me.   
   At last, by teaching other study memebers, i can understand more correctly.  Not only be taught from other study members, but also teaching  other students  is a good way to study.  When i teach other people, i can organize our knowledge that i am going to say .  if i do this, i can remember the knowledge for long period of time than before. furethermore, i can realize my weak part when i teach the whole part i know.  
  To summarize, because i can learn new knowledge, inspire to study hard and reviw my knowledge i prefer study with a grop of studnents more.  "	2.5	2.0	1.0	5.5
2077	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"To answer this question, I think that they must be solved that the questions, ""What is the purpose of hobby?""
Let's answer to that question. What is the purpose of hobby? I think it has two main purposes. First, people wants to clear their working-studying stress to do their hobby. Second, simultaneously, people wants to get some accomplishments which could not be get by their main job to do their hobby. So in my opinion, good hobby is that satisfies those two conditions.
Then we should answer the following question. ""What is the main job of college student?"" It is 'study'. And this study is focusing the subjects of their major. 
Therefore, the students don't want to be a ""studier"". For example, a student who is major in mechanical engineering doesn't want to be a person who is studying mechanical engineering continuously for their life. He or she may wants to be a scholar or business man/woman. They dream about their future, they dream about that they make an accomplishment on their future job.
So I think that the good hobby is ""Fun activity for their future dream"". If one want to be a scholar, the writing can be a good hobby for him or her. Because the essential skill of scholar is writing to write articles, and it is hard to learn from university education. In other case, If one want to be a programmer, doing new project like ""making business"" can be a good hobby. (Although many people says that enterpreneur must dedicate for their work unlike hobby) Doing a self-made project to solve their own problem will be a good experience(career) for them.
In my case, my dream is to be a management strategic consultant. And it is so sad fact that KAIST is concentrated on science and technology. So, to make my dream true, I am polishing my logical thinking and communication skill with participating session as a member of a management studying club.
I think that college students will be more happy when enjoying their good hobby. Thank you for reading!"	2.0	2.0	2.0	6.0
1796	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	" What do you think is the advantage of foreign countries? They can have better social systems, education, public welfare, etc. Not all, but there are good things about foreign countries than our home country. Because of that, many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. I will talk about the three reasons that why do some students study abroad.
 First of all, they can study foreign languages. If students go to foreign schools or universities, they will be a master of the language of the country where school or university are located. They have to speak, listen, write, and read with that language, so it is very helpful to learn foreign languages. To addition, there can be different foreign students that they are also studying abroad from different countries. It can be a opportunity to learn another foreign languages when talk with abother student that studying abroad.
 Second reason is that they can get better education than their home countries. Most of students who want studying abroad choose the schools or universities in advanced countries like America. Advanced countries have very good education. Their education systems, schools, classes, teachers, even classmates are of good quality. Also their socials are have benefits to study. Several companies act for education like donation.
 Finally, the foreign countries have a wide range of education. Korean education mainly consists of major subjects like math, science, laws etc or money making subjects like economy, engineering etc. Because of that some of students can not study about what they want. However, some foreign countries teach more various than our home country. Also some countries teach different subjects because of social perception.
 To sum up, many students study abroad because of foreign languages, better education, and a wide range of education. Of course you can study in your home country enoughly, because our home countries are trying to improve education. However, if you have a goal to studying, then studying abroad is worth thinking about."	3.5	3.5	2.5	9.5
1802	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"Some students leave their home countries to study.

  What is your dream? When you were in the elementary school, I think you did not think about your real dream yet, just played with your friends. However, few years later when you were in high school, probably you had a dream. Then you considered your future from that point and the most important one is university. You can get high level class in there and it will be a very big help to you  to reach to the goal. However, if there is no appropriate college near to you, you cannot get information easily. Then you will find the university outside your home countries. So, today I argue that some students study abroad because of appropriate department of their dreams and high level classes.
  First, for some minor subjects, some universities have no class for them. Most colleges have departments for very major subjects such as mathematics, engineering, music, and languages. If your dream is related to these kind of department, you can easily to get information from the university. However, if you want to study some unique subjects, some college may not have a class about them. Then you must find other university and if you find it, it can be placed outside your home countries.
  Second, you want to join high level class for your dream. Nowadays, many students study hard to go to the top class universities. It means they want to get the better class and also if you graduate one of those colleges, you get huge advantages for your dream. When a company hire employees, they see what university did you graduate and the university is in high level, the company really want you more. After you get a job, you can do your work easily based on high quality class.
  To sum up, some students choose abroad university because of appropriate and high quality class. You have to go to college that has a department related your interest. If some universities have your department, then you will choose the best university. Studing abroad is good way to catch your dream."	4.0	4.0	3.0	11.0
1175	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In these days, most universities in Korea are executing 100% online classes, non-face-to-face lectures. Using real-time lecture by ZOOM session and non-real-time lecture by KLMS is included in online courses. Actually, this type of lectures is very useful and necessary for universities. They should be executed for several reasons, and let me show two of them.
First of all, limitations for time and space are removed! Students are able to take lectures at any time or anywhere you want Instructors can cut or edit the unnecessary parts of the lectures. Moreover, the students adjust the fast of lecture, and they use pausing to make their notes. Especially, this feature is very effective for Mathematics and Science lectures that the connects of formula are very important. Also, in KAIST which has many English lectures, it gives students time for searching unknown vocabularies. According to my friend, Minhan Gang, âThe lecture is very helpful for me, because I can find many unknown words in lectures.â
Second, online classes are fundamental methods to prevent virus. The fundamental reason why we are doing 100% non-face-to-face classes is on the COVID-19 situation. If we participate offline classes, it is necessary for the pandemic situation to consist. Although the benefits of offline classes are very high, the effect of online classes for preventing the corona virus today overwhelms these benefits. Moreover, if we participate the offline classes, we have to use a hand cleaner, wear a mask, and participate several activities for preventing. These will be harmful for study.
For these reasons, online classes are necessary for these days. Using online courses removes limitation for time-space, and they are a fundamental way to prevent COVID-19. If you are taking online courses now, then why donât you use these good benefits? It will be helpful for your study!"	5.0	4.5	4.5	14.0
1049	Lifestyles: Some people prefer to get up early in the morning and start the dayâs work. Others prefer to get up later in the day and work until late at night. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.	"Nowadays, many people works and lives in the diverse kinds of lifestyle. Some of them prefer to work in the night, or others want to work in the morning. There are mixed opinions about this argument because both of them have a pros and cons. In my opinion, getting up early and starting the work is a beneficial for several reasons.
     First of all, getting up early is good for healthy. human has a biological rhythm that he or she wakes up when sun rises and sleeps down when sun set. If we destroy a biological rhythm, the immune system is damaged. For example, the bones weakens, the dark circle appears, the digest system does not works properly. Therefore, getting up later and working until late at night hurts the healthy. 
     In addition to healthy, getting up and processing the task early is good for the mental. If the task is complete late, the burden makes the stress, which cause negative emotions. However, when the task is dealt with early, the employee gets away from the pressure of the task. It makes their mental healthy; they can live a healthy life.
     Some people argue that they can efficiently concentrate on the task at late night. However, it's just a psychological illusion. they can focus on the task with same concentration when they get up early. There is no evidence that working at night is better than at the morning if the condition such as the sleeping time is same. 
     To sum up, working in the early morning is a best choice in terms of the body and mental healthy. There is no advantages of working at late night even in the aspect of the concentration. The healthy life comes when people get up and start their work early.  "	4.0	4.0	4.0	
1060	Lifestyles: Some people spend their entire lives in one place. Others move a number of times throughout their lives, looking for a better job, house, community or even climate. Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"I prefer to try new things and take risks. There are three reasons that I prefer that.
  First, try new things make me get a wide sight and get a creative idea. for example, just learning mechanical engineering courses  can make me manufacture only programmed robots. However, learning not only ME courses but also computer science or bio-science courses can make me manufacture various robots like bio-robots or AI robots. 
 Second,  try new things can make easy to get a job or enter the graduate school. In my case, I'm in ME department, so I'm good at solve mechanical problem and making products. However, professors researching AI these days, so they want to select student who knows AI well into their lab. Therefore,  I prefer to try study AI even though I'm not good at this
 Finally, try new things are fun. just do already I know is boring. Learning a new thing or making a new creative product make me fell joy.
 These three reasons are why I prefer to try new things rather than already do well"	2.5	3.0	2.5	
1803	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"  Did you have the schools or universities that you want to go? Many students want to go to famous universities, and get a good class. In addition, some students want to go universities outside their home countries. Like this, we can see the students who study abroad in mordon life, and we will find the reasons.
  The first reason is that the students want to get a good class like I said in intro. Many students want good teacher and proffeser. In some case, their are in other countries. So, students go to outside. For example, the student in Korea want to get a class by Harverd proffeser, then he or she should go to USA  and go Harverd. In addition, more deeper you study, then the informations in home countries are not enough in many case. Therefore, they go outside.
  Second, follow the parents. If the student's parents have to go other countries long time by job or other things, then most of  student go with them. For example, my friend's father go to india for work, and the all family go to india. Of course, my friend study at school in india.
 The Last  reason, to study word. For example, I am not good at english, and if I go to USA to study, then I have to use english in there, so my english will be better. Like this, some students go to outside home countries to learn word. In this case, schools or universities are additional thing.
  To sum up, many students study abroad in three reasons, want to get a good class by teacher or proffeser who are in other countries, follow the parents, to study word. Therefore if you want to go outside home countries, then do not scared! You are not the only student study abroad."	3.0	3.5	2.0	8.5
1209	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Many people travel to many place with their close friends or family or themselves in their free time. Why do they travel besides they have to spend a lot of time? I think people travel for these reasons.

First, You can make good memories and have good experience. By traveling, they experience manythings such as local tradition, language, special place and food. Therefore, people who have traveled a lot will have very colorful and special experiences. Also these things will be a very good energy for your life.

Second, You can be familiar with people who are not so much close with you. Traveling make a lot of good memories to people and can be a co-interesting with many people. So, If you travel with many people and talk with them about traveling, you will be very familiar with them and also be able to be a best friend. Also, you can travel with them just for fun.

Third, You will be able to learn many things by traveling. In my opinion, Traveling is a kind of study. Traveling give many ideas that we can't get from a book or our desk. Traveling expends our sight to see the world and make our mind grow more.

In conclusion, many people travel for their good memories, experience, relationship, themselves or just for fun. I think time spent by traveling is not wasteful at all. I strongly recomand you to travel with many people many times. It will be very valuable for your life and it can't be changed with other things. "	3.5	4.0	3.0	10.5
1805	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"Why many students choose to go abroad universities to study? That is because going abroad has more special adavanages than in hometown.  that  Beside the disadvantage that the unviersity is far from his or her home, students attent farther school because it has advantages. Stduents attend abroad school for two reasons.
    First of all, stduents attend abroad school because they want to go unviersity where specifies in the subject what they want to learn. In the world, there are so many unviersities, and how advanced about each subjects is different for every universities. As students want to learn deeper and more advanced, they go to university where the subject is advanced even if the unviersity is not in home countries. For example, most of students who are interested in science and math want to go MIT, and most of students who are interested in politics want to go Harvard. Also, how advanced about the subject is related to the professor of that subject or lab. Famous and intelligent professors can make student more develope than others. For instance, some people came to KAIST not only KAIST is the best science advanced university, but also KAIST has many famous professors and the labs where make good results.
     Second, students go abroad unviersities to increase their foreign language skills. While they live in other country, students can learn foreign language faster than learning the language in their hometown. They have to survive at the new country, so they have to improve the language to live and not to have difficulties in abroad life. For exmaple, the reasons why Korean students go to US unversities are the quality of lecture and to improve their English skills. In addition, students can feel the culture of the country, so they can learn the language easily. The language is related to the culture of that society. They can feel and understand the culture of the country, so they can learn the language with experience and can write or speak more naturally as nations of the country.
    In summary, many stduents go to abroad unviersities because they can listen to more advanced lectures than hometown unviersities and can improve foreign language skills. If you attend  abroad university, it could be unfamiliar at first  because it is in foreign. However, the time will solve that uncomfortable. You can get several special opportunities in abroad which cannot given in your hometown universities. If you are interested in going abroad schools, then think about the speical advantages of abroad school and determine your decision."	4.5	4.5	2.5	11.5
1016	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Careful Planning to Success
There is a controversial topic about how to success. Some say success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others think that success results from careful planning. In my opinion, careful planning is more appropriate to success in life.
     First of all, careful planning is effective. Planing is proper way to know current circumstance exactly. Many can think about what should do now, and can consider step by step process to improve themselves. They find information about their fields while planning. It could be very helpful to their success.
     In addition to effective way, planning is more safe way.  During planning, many think about various situations. This is helpful for when they meet unexpected situation. Because they consider lots of circumstance, they can solve the problem well.
     Some argue that taking risks can get big advantage. However, that is very rare case in reality. If they take risks and not plan about future, it should make disappointed results. Many says that appropriate planning is needed to get expected results.
     To sum up, careful planning is proper to success. It is more effective than taking risks or chances, and it is safe way to success. Some think that taking risk is chance to get big advantage, but it is just very small number of cases. If many do careful planning well, they can get expected results in future."	4.0	4.0	4.0	
301	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are still controversies about universities should require students to take classes in many subjects or to specialize in one subject. Among them, some people say that students should specialize in one factor to be more specialized person and to have high-level thinking. However, I think students should be required to take classes in many subjects for following three reasons. 

To the begin with, when students take classes in many topics and subjects, combining two or more of subjects could be easier for them and can have additional knowledge. In recent days, there are many research topics that combines two or more topics and requires the knowledge of other subjects. In addition, there are cases that knowing only one specific area is not sufficient to resolve the required problem. For instance, sometimes, designing and computing is required for mathematics when researchers should have to found optical way in problem solving. 

Second, it is much easier to contract and communicate with people in other area when students get their jobs. When students have carrier in the future, they will meet many peoples in many parts. To communicate and have a talk with them, students should have to learn and research about the language of the other area to understand specific contents. For example, the students who have learned about mathematics can contact with computer scientist to make formula about society communication and develop the platform. However, if they don't know each other's subject and language, the communication must be much difficult for them and will need more time for them to explaining to each other, which is not an efficient way. In addition, they both should study about the contents about the society if they don't know about it too. 

Lastly, students can have more creative thinking, if they can learn majority of subjects in the university. The word 'creativity' is often thought as a 'new' or 'fascinating' ideas. These thinking can be brought when someone combines one area with another area that nobody considered before. For instance, Davinchi had found many things ny

In conclusion, I think specializing in one area might have advantages for some students. However, learning the other subjects might have more benefits for the students because students can have additional knowledge be combining two areas, can be much easier to contact and communicate with other area people, and can have more creative thinking.

1237	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I am currently a freshman in college. But since I took classes online instead of off-line when I entered college, so I can't compare the two classes. but I will talk about the advantages  of online classes. First, online classes don't require much preparation to take classes. For example, we don't have to dress well, and you can take classes with a comfortable mind and pose in our room. 
Second, you can record the contents of the classes and listen to the important part again. For example, when we are tired in class, we can't listen important part well at off-line class. But in online class, we can see it back! Third, there may be advantages to timid friends. Because they have a hard time asking questions face-to-face, but in the case of online-classes, they can ask questions through text messaging rather than face-to-face, so I think they can ask questions with a more comfortable mind. Last, when we are in online class, we can get a little homework because of cheating. when teacher give homework, teacher looks for whether this homework can cheat. So homework that can cheat removes in our homework, so we get a little homework. it is all of advantages in online. Thank you."	3.0	3.0	3.0	9.0
419	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" I believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Of course there are benefits for attending class,  however, it is not necessary. I want to suggest some reasons.

 First, almost every information is in the textbook and it is sufficient to read and solve exercises. In many classes are consists of summaries for the book. I agree that some professors give intuition for difficult concept or help students to understand complicated theories which is hard to study alone. However, some just read textbooks in the class or the delivery is too bad to listen during one and a half hour. In other case, it is possible that the lecture is nice but the style of lecture is not fit for student. Considering these possibilities, it is helpful for students to attend class optionally.

 Second, students have responsibilities for all disadvantages occur from not attending class. Therefore, if someone who know the advantages for attending and and agree with them, then that one will take class. If someone finds that there is more valuable task that class, then absent and take responsibility for one's behavior.

 For these two reasons, I believe that attending class is not necessary."	2.5	3.5	3.0	9.0

Although they recommended that kids do not play it, many kids play them. In fact, this problem is much devated. In this essay, I argue about that violent video games affect kids in a negative way for 2 reason.
 First, kids will be not afraid of violent things. Hating violent thing is normal mind. But kids watch violent thing in young age, they don't know why this is afraid thing. It is very dangerous because they can become don't afraid about crime. Also, it can be affect to kids become violent. They can hit or bullying other kids in school. In the other word, violent games can cause school bullying.
 Second, kids can be teached bad things by violent game. Adult can think which is bad thing or good thing, but kids can't think it well. So kids learn about bad words, crimes, etc. For example, think about that kids learn about bad word in game. Because they don't know that is bad word, they understand that this word is just used at angry moment. Therefore they can use it to other people. Also they can learn many crimes in game. So they can use in real and it will be crime.
 In conclusion, I argue about violent video games affect kids in a negative way. Although it has many reasons, I wrote 2 big reasons in this essay. First reason is kids be not afraid of violent things so kids become violent. Another reason is kids can learn about bad things in violent game. This becomes they can act bad behavior. Although violent games are dangerous to kids, they can easily play it in online. Therefore the law about regulating age in game must be reinforced."	4.5	4.0	3.5	12.0

" If the question means I can change any one thing in our country like god, I want to delete covid 19 in our country. But I think it maybe about making some policy to change, so let's think about it. If we want to change something to improve our country, we have to know what is the problem of our country. Ofcourse there would be a lot of problems in the country like covid 19, but I don't know or a lot of them or their solution. So I want to focus  what I realize alot now. It is the problem of English.
 Korean students study hard in high school. So  I heard that they get almost top grade in the test compare to other country.  But many Korean doesn't do well in universe that much. Many reasons maybe causes it like they play alot in university, but I think English is one of the biggist reason. 
 When we learn biology or chemistry, we have to learn all term when we learned before Korean. When we take lecture, we take English lecture instead of Korean lecture like before. It is hard to Korean student like me,  But it is needed to study and communicate with other country. So we should not change our university, but we should change before university.
 We have to think about the reason of the problem. Korean students also study English hard. what made the problem? I think it is because they just study to do test well. It is not that much useful to take lecture or make their opinion in English. So I think Korean student should study English more for that technologies. They are focused on going good university, so university should focus on that when they choose student "	3.5	3.5	3.0	10.0
