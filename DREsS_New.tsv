1	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"Many university classes requires the attendance in the class so that it is included in the score. However, I think that the class attendance should be optional for students. There are three reasons to argue optional attendance. First, the adults have freedom to make own decisions. The university students are matured enough to be responsible to their decisions. Less attendance will results into less opportunity to learn. If a student decided to take the risk, the successive results is all his or her matter. Second, it is not efficient to have the attendance as one of the scoring criteria. The score is a metric to measure how the student understand the course materials. If a student already has perfect understanding, he or she should have good score. There is no need to attend the class only for grading. Therefore, nice grading system should not include the attendance. Third, the professor can instruct the students who are more willing to learn. Not all students want to learn a lot in the class. They just attend the class, and do something else. However, it makes the class atmosphere worse. Free attendance can solve the problem by releasing just-attenders. It will leave the students who want to learn something in the class. In short, the attendance is not really important in the university. The students are aged enough to choose own attendance. Moreover, the attendance causes several inefficiencies. The class can be more effective without the attendance."	3.5	4	3.5	11

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"The university is the place where people go to study. Students enter to university because they want to earn something. However, attendance of class is another point of view. Some people say it is student's own optional property, but that is not simple like that. First of all, attandance is not only for that one student alone. Attending class is not only for students but also for professors. They interaction each other and they learn some basic rule, manner. If students think attendance is optional, than almost of them would not go to class at all. Other studenants who just go to class also can think attendance is not needed anymore. Than, professors may think why the class should be continue. Furthermore, absense at all class and single attendance for test is such a ignoring the objective of professor. Students who thinks attend to class is optional because they can learn or study themselves. But, all each lecture of professor is very differents to course of syllabus. His objective, point of view, some new information that only he can give, and how to solve the problem is most important and that is basically why we enter the university. Finally, attending the class is best way to evaluate students about how they can control themselves. If there is one student who attend every class and another student who except 4 class, it means simply first student control his study schedule and make the promise between professors and students. Students pay the huge amount of money for entering university. They might be able to think attendance is their own rights in our capitailism society, but reality is more complecated. To find more good thing in university, students should attend to all class."	4	3.5	3.5	11
3	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"Some people may think that attendance is requirement of university students. But, I think there are some reasons for selecting attendance for university student. I'll discuss why they do not need to attend class. First, the class is not the best way for studying to several students. Students could improve their studying environment in various way, for example, search on google, paper sites, or even exploring some places. It means, not only the class is the best way for studying. To supply effective studying environment, we should think fit method for each student, and one of the easiest way is do not merge them through the class. Second, there are more chances for improving their lifestyle. Lifestyle, I mean, can be responsibility, time managing, or planning. They could get those experience through more selective class than before. Third, Attendance is just working on dividing grades. There is possibility that some students do not have any interests on class due to speed of instruction, their condition, etc, however, almost of them just sit on the chair, for getting their attendance points. Could you say it is proper situation for education? I think it isn't. From now on, I suggest three reasons that we should not force students to attend class - The class can not be the best way for studying, there are more chances for improving their lifestyle, Attendance is just working on dividing grades. I think we should give more various way for student, and the start point is do not force them to attend class."	3.5	3	3	9.5
4	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"There are many people debate that attendance check is required in university. Some students argue that the attendance check is important to make good study atmosphere and to evaluate students’ attitude for class. However, I believe that the attendance is optional for students. There are several reasons on following essay. First of all, involuntary attendance check makes bad class environment. Students who do not want take class just come class to take attendance point. They are not interested in class, so they sleep in class or work other things in class. This situation will disturb other students’ study. If the free-attendance check is carried out, students who want to study in class take the class spontaneously and they also can get good grade. Secondly, the attendance check prevents growth of social skills. The university students are adults. They have responsibility to take or absent their class. After their graduation, no one is not interested in their life. They must go to work for themselves. The forceful attendance check disrupts students’ independence. Many people emphasize the attendance for students. But the attendance check can make bad class atmosphere and to disrupt social senses for independence. Therefore, It is good that the students take the class voluntarily with optional attendance check."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
5	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"Attending the class is necessary for students and professor. These days, some students believe that going to class is optional and unnecessary. However I have two reasons that attending class is required. First, lecture is not only focused on giving academic information by the professor. By the lecture, students can make the relationship with professors and communicate with other students. We will get great experience by interacting with different and various people. We can much develop our academical thinking and learn how to communicate with a lot of people. Second, as more student attends the class, the quality of class becomes higher. Even though professor is how smart or excellent, talking alone in the class is not effective and exhausting. Professor can check the understanding by seeing the students and give questions to them. These interaction will make the lecture better and quality of lecture become higher."	3.5	3	3.5	10
6	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"The attendance is controversial problem in university. Some professors don't care about the attendance but the other includes the attendance in grade. In my opinion, university students should not be required to attend classes. First of all, they take classes by paying their money. They decide to enroll in university and take a class by themselves. All of these are their choices. So, attending the class also should be one of choices. There is no reason for interfering there freedom. Deciding importance of attendance is up to students. Furthermore, attending the class could be not the best choice for learning something. Attending the class could be wasting time for some students who already know about contents of the class because there are many similar class in university or they study that contents in advance. Therefore, students could receive a good grade without attending the class. In that time, they can do other valuable things and develop themselves. In conclusion, attending the class should be optional for students. Because, the choice is individual freedom and attendance is not the best decision for learning for someone."	3	3	3.5	9.5
7	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"I agree with the statement that students should be required to attend classes. there may be a couple of reasons for that. First, if universities allow students not to attend classes, it might cause students to get lazy because students might not be able to see what other students are doing or get lost through curriculum. This can be proven by current online class environment where most students push back recorded lectures until exam or never see the videos. On the other hand, when students go to the classes, they can focus on the classes on given hours and also check their knowledge and communicate with professor and other students. Second, It is much more better to be taught by professor than studying by oneself. Even though one may know almost every class materials, professor can give special knowledge and experiences which would never be acquired without class. it does more apply to major classes because most major classes is given by a professor who researched for that class subject over ten years. professors can give students their laboratory experiments of textbook contents or explain real applications in industry for better understanding of vague scientific principles. Therefore, with above two reasons, I recommend students to attend classes and follow class contents with most professional instructions and communication with other participants."	4	4	4	12
8	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"Unlike high school life, where there was no single perception and absence, I often was late or absent from class of college. There were various reasons for perception and absence. Sometimes there were days when I couldn't go to sleep because of many tasks. Another day was caused by excessive drinking. This behavior adversely affected my grades, and for whatever reason, I still have great regret for my behavior. Except for my personal wishes, I think attendance at university is not very important. I believe that going to classes should be optional for students. University education is not about teaching integrity. It is about teaching the knowledge of the majors. Therefore, the evaluation should focus on achievement of majors, not focus on integrity. Most students who are absent and late will not be able to easily understand the content of the class, which will lead to low achievement. They will receive low grade even if they do not evaluate about their integrity. However, in some cases, despite showing an unfaithful attitude, some students could get good understanding of their major. This is not a problem at all. If they understand everything without taking a class, that's why they don't have to attend class. Also, it's meaningless to take attendance now, as Corona 19 makes a non face-to-face class. As classes were conducted online, classes could be taken regardless of time and place. But forcing students to take lectures at a given time would reduce the advantages of online. Also, if taking online, it may be difficult to take a lectures at a given time due to technical problem. Checking attendance is not easy work. The significance of checking attendance is to encourage participation, but in fact, attendance is not effective in checking integrity or paying attention to class. Attendance just checks if students have attended. Even if the students are sleeping throughout the class or watching their cell phone, they will receive a perfect score for attendance. If professors want to make students truly participate in the class, they should find another way rather than simply checking attendance. For example, they can get a better effect by evaluating factors such as whether you have done your tasks for the class or actively responded to the professor's questions."	3.5	3.5	4	11
9	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"I agree with that students should attend classes. There's two reasons. First, Checking attendance is proper way to check students' achievement level. Students have their rights to absent on their classes. But also, professors have rights to check attendance for grading the students. If professor decided to check attendance, students should follow it. When students want to be absent on class, then they should suggest proper reasons for absence to professor. Second, diligence should be scored. For example, One student already knew most of lecture, so he absent most of lecture. Another student attended every classes and study hard. But two students got same grade because of middle & final exam. I think this is unfair. Not only the knowledge, but also the diligence is very important skill for student. In conclusion, We should check attendance because it's proper way to test students' diligence. But, if there's unavoidable reasons to absent the class, it should be accepted. So that can provide students' rights for absence."	3	3	3	9
10	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"I believe that university students are required to attend classes. The first reason is that grading has to be made not only with their ability but also the effort they spent. The second reason is that attending classes makes the quality of class better. The final reason is that it makes students study. Grading should not be made only with their ability. I think the university is an institute that teaches a student to make them better. If we grade them only with their ability, there will be no valuation of how much the student has improved with their effort. Checking attendance can protect the basic principle of universities: improving. Without attending classes, it deteriorates the quality of classes. The class have to be a place that every student discusses each other to improve every students' skill. If attending is not required, there will be fewer students who attend the course and eventually, the essence of the class, the frequency of discussions will get lower. Making students study in a compulsive manner can actually be a good stimulant. For example, students study a lot before the midterm and final exams. The test makes them study even if they don't really want to do it. Giving a penalty to the students who do not attend can show the same effects. They will go to the classroom and study even if they want to miss the class. A number of people think that the class attendance is not required. However, if students are required to attend the classes, their effort in studying cannot be reflected in their grades, the quality of the class will deteriorate, and students could not get any regulations to make them study hard."	3	3	3.5	9.5
11	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"I think higher education should be available only to good students. In here, 'good students' is not just smart people. It contains the meaning that they are at least diligent in their life. First, smart people are worthy to get higher education, and creative people have also have that. But, some people is not that smart to be a genius. But there are more people who are not genius. They may have great intelligence, but it would be not sufficient to be a genius like Einstein or Euler. However, all products are not made from those few genius. People who are not genius can cooperate and make company so that they make more creative or useful things. If they can't get higher education due to lack of best intelligence, many of the products we use cannot exist on our surroundings. Second, we should think about the purpose of the education. Education is to make society to be powerful and give some profit. But, if only genius can get higher education, it can be not the case. So, the personality should be great factor to get qualification. The genius can be lazy, or has no ability to communicate and not cooperative. Or, their personality is not that good for society of humans. For example, they can agree with painful experiment with human. Then, it is hard to say that the product is useful or desirable for human. Then, the higher education is useless because education is for society profit. Until now, I explained the reason why 'good students' means not just smart genius people. And next, I'll explain why the higher education should be not be available to bad students. First, bad student means not good intelligence and not diligent in their study. Then, it is not desirable for them to get education consistently. Because bad students means they are not talent, interested, and diligent in this area. So, it is more efficient for them to learn the other techniques to get other jobs. Second, bad students have higher probability to destroy the atmosphere. They will not cooperative, and may cannot follow the speed of good students. It may results in loss for both sides. Those are the reason why higher education should be given for smart, or diligent people. As said above, the purpose of the education is to give them good environment to study and to be useful people for society. So, whether it is fair or unfair, the higher education should be given to good students. It will be efficient for human society and for students who are bad or good."	3.5	3.5	3	10
12	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"I think that going to classes should be optional for students. First, university students are adults. If they can have responsibility in their behavior, they can do anything in their lives. So they don't have to go classes but they should accept their grades of classes. Second, university education course is not a duty in Korea. Students don't have to take an university education and they also have rights that they reject the classes. But as I already said in first reason, they should endure the reactions following when they go or don't go to classes. In last, classes exist to teach something to students. If students already understand about the contents of classes, they don't have to spend time in classes. They can do other thing like study other contents or take a rest. Using time effectively is good for students and professor both. Because of these reasons, I think going to classes should be optional for students. They are adults, so they can choose what they do or do not. And taking university classes are not duty unlike elementery school or middle school classes. I think they can decide go classes or not in their opinion."	3	3	3	9
13	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"Generally, some people thinks that the attendance is very important to students. However, I would like to say that the restriction for attendance is no longer helpful for the students. I would explain my opinion in the following essay. First of all, the classes held in university are additional for those who wants to listen to about the materials and ask a question. There are some students who have difficulties to understand the theme of classes without additional information, such as answers of their questions. However, the class materials are usually good enough, so a lot of students are fine to understand the whole class only with the materials. Thus, it does not have to restrict students to participate the real-time class with deduction of the score. Next, the classes could waste students' time. Almost every classes do not include fine quality information. Usually, the professors just read the material in their classes, and students are sleeping instead of listening to the class. This kind of class could bring a bad effect to the student. The efficiency of work is getting higher when someone is really willing to do that. So, if the student do another works, such as their homework, part-time jobs or leisure while the class time, and study about the class whenever they feels they are necessary to learn them, the whole efficiency would be higher than before. Thus, the study time for students should not be restricted by the class time. To summarize my point above, the class in university is not very helpful for every students who can understand the theme of the subject without the class, and sometimes it could be harmful for the efficiency of the works for students. By these points, I would urge that the attendance of class should be optional."	4	3.5	3.5	11

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"In university, students should attend classes, so they can have no penalty of their grade. Students may have different opinion about this. Someone may think students should be required to attend classes. But the other hand other may think students don't have to attend classes. I have participated univiersity classes and my opinion is students should be required to attend classes. First of all, if students attend classes, when they may have question, they can ask their question to professor immediatly. We can have question while we participate classes because university study is difficult. And we may not solve the question because of leak of knowledge. However, professors have a lot of knoledge about major and they almost can solve our question. And I think this is huge advantage of attending classes. Second, we can discussion about major with friend. Some classes are discussion classes by professor. These classes need all students participate the class. I listen some discussion class, and I could get more opinion about subject and knowledge by discussion with friends. Although there are not discussion classes, students can ask something like missing information or simple question to their friends in classes. Last, professors can teach more efficiently. In this semester, one of my classes 's professor says ""I want to see my students face in real. Because I can know whether students understand or not by watching their face."" So I thought attending classes is need for professor. If many students don't attend class, professor can't know about part which students feel very difficult. However if many students attend professor's class, they will question about part which they can't understanding. Then professor can teach more detail about this part and many students can learn their major easily. I think students should be required to attend classes because they can ask to professor and communicate with friends, and professor teach more efficeintly. I hope many students"	4	3.5	3	10.5
15	University:Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. Others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.    	"I think several short vacations are more helpful for students than one long vacation. First, students can't use their vacation efficiently if there is one vacation. There are some activity which can only be done on specific season. For example, we go swimming pool on summer and we go to play ski on winter. Next, students can't relax more frequently. Most people want to take a rest many times in a year. One long vacation doesn't satisfy those people's needs. Last, students can be lazy when they are in a long vacation. If students feel comfortable their long vacation, they may not want to study and it is hard to change their mind to make an effort. Therefore, students should have several short vacations throughout the year."	3	3	3.5	9.5
16	University:Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. Others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.    	"In my opinion, it is better for student take a long vacation than take a short vacation several times each year. The purpose of vacation is take a rest for student to prevent a burn out for study hard. Each student has a different way of relaxing. Some student think of some computer games or reading book .. as a way to relax. However, there are some student think that traveling abroad is a good way to relax. If these students take a short vacation several times each year, they may not have enough time to go on a planned overseas trip. When we have a long vacation, there is much more we can do during the vacation. It is means that if we have a short vacation each year, then we can do during the vacation is limited. To provide students with a variety of relaxation and replenishment opportunities, I think it is better to give a long vacation to student than short several vacation."	3	3	3	9

Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.    	"In my opinion, students should be given one long vacation. At the first, Korean school system maintained summer and winter vacations. It means, the most of students are adapted for the system. If the short vacations realized, there can be massive numbers of confused students. Then, for escaping the confusing, our society should consider about the totally different semester system for new students. This will occurs unfair chance problems for traditional students. The next, sometimes students need distance from school works. In the contemporary society, the studying is not the only subject for human life. there are so many outer activities which help students. Sports, trips, festivals, self studying, even though rest also required. But the short vacation cannot completely satisfy those outer subjects. Simply, they needs times. Our education system should recognize the several independent times from the school are useful. Not only the school semester system, also several workings, for example office working, allows long vacations for each years. The society already knows the importance of long vacation. Our life does not fulfilled with a piece of learning. By those reasons, I propose the long vacation for the students."	3.5	3	3.5	10

Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.    	"Just a few people will disagree to the necessity of vacation. Students are the people who need a vacation, too. However, there is a conflict between the one long vacation and short and often vacations. Although there are some people who insist the long vacation is better, short vacations are necessary for the students. First of all, vacation which is too long will make the students cannot study. If there is exaggerate space between the semesters, they may forget what they have learned in last semester. This brings more difficulties to students to study next semester's things. Therefore, students cannot study well when there is a long one vacation. Next, a Long semester gives bad effects to the students either. the students are being tired during the semester. They need some time to recharge. However, long one semester derived from long one vacation will block them to rest. Without rest, they will be exhausted while they think the semester is never-ending. These are the reasons for the necessity of short and often vacations. Too long work or too long rest does not help students. Only appropriate work and appropriate rest will make them happier. In conclusion, short vacations are better than one long vacation."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.    	"There is vacation between each semester. There are big issue related vacation. Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year, and others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout year. I prefer to have one long vacation each year. There are two reasons why I prefer one long vacation. First of all, this is how I am. If I have several short vacations, It would make me grumpy and boring. As my major is electronic engineering, the study require me to use and apply previous theory that I learned before. Also as my study style is based on memory, I am going to forget and study again when I have several short vacations. Therefore, studying continuously without resting is more effective way to achieve. Secondly, one long vacation makes me more productive. To be specific, most of the people use the vacation for recharging their batteries and preparing next semester. Also they spend time for lots of valuable activity such as R&E(research program), Internship, travel. To do these things, the students need 2~3 months minimum. As I am KAISTian and have huge amount of things to study, I want to participate research program and Internship when I am free from exam. To conclusive, I prefer to have one long vacation due to following reasons; first, my study style fits to long vacation rather than several short vacation. second, long vacation is more productive in my case."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
20	University:Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. Others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.    	"I think the vacation should be a long, not just the several short vacations. There are three reasons why I agree with the former opinion rather than latter, based on my experiences. First, to obtain some certificates of several departments during the vacation, we need a long period of time to prepare for test and re-test. For example, if we want to get a higher score on TOEIC in this vacation, some students will take an Internet-academy lectures, others will read through some books. It costs a time more than we expect to achieve our goals, because there's no guarantee that we'll pass the test at once. Second, many part-time jobs want to hire the people that can work as long as possible. For example, if you have a private lesson with middle or high school students, their parents want to contact with you as long as possible, for further feedback. However, if there are several short vacations for you, the flow of you and your student will cut off, and both you and student's parent will hesitate to keep your lessons going on. Not only the private lesson, but also some part-time jobs related to services like cafe or department store, owners don't want to hire some people that work only about 3~4 weeks. Third, to travel some foreign countries with friends or family members, long period of one vacation is quite convenient to plan and match with others' schedules. Let's think about we are planning for Europe trip with best friends. One friend can have a part-time job in every weekend, and another friend can have an important meeting on specific weekdays. In this case, you will have a trouble with making a golden time of your trip unless you have a long vacation. In conclusion, for my individual academic and economic achievements, and making a wonderful harmony with others' schedules, long period of time in vacation is necessary for me."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
21	University:Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. Others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.    	"As the question said, some people may think that several short vacations throughout the year is better than one long vacation each year. But for my opinion, I think just one long vacation each year is better than the other case. First, with several short vacations, we cannot complete any goal for the vacation. I usually make some goals for one vacation that I would complete in the period, and it usually take at least 1 month for completing one of them. But if there are only short vacations, then we would not do things fully and just leave them uncompleted. In other words, it would be waste of time. On the other hand, in long vacation, we can set several goals and also we can complete some of them, maybe all of them, so the vacation would be more valuable. Second, with several short vacations, we cannot have various experiences. When we take a rest in weekend, usually stay at home or just go out around home but this is because we have not enough time for go out far away, like abroad. Like this, with short vacations, we cannot go abroad especially far from our country, and this would reduce opportunities of experiences that we can get from there. Then it would reduce our site of view and it is not good for the development of not only ourselves but also our society. However, in long vacation, we can go anywhere since we have enough time and we could meet various people, experience other cultures and do some new things easily. It will help us to think in other ways and make us more creatively. Third, with several short vacations, we would have trouble to get some rest. As I mentioned in above one, people usually stay at home on weekend since we have not enough time for go out far away. And there's another reason of this, the things that we should do previously for the next weekday. In short vacations, we also have same trouble of these. For students, in example, they would have some homeworks that due to the next day of the holiday, or maybe they would have some test on next day of the holiday. It would make students to prepare for them, will exchange the time for rest as for study and make trouble to get some rest. But for long vacation, students would have enough time for both of preparing them and getting some rest. In short, we can complete our goals, have more experiences for long vacation and take some rest fully on the vacation, and this is the reason why long vacation is more valuable than several short vacations.

The opinion can be reasoned through the usage of the vacation. During the vacation, we can rest and have a chilling time doing hobbies. Having a fine vacation restoring for next semester is important, too. But I think long time is needed to achieve meaningful experience than just resting. For example, traveling with short term normally includes enjoying the traditional food or sports. Those activities are good to 'enjoy' the culture in one country, but usually not enough to 'understand' and 'learn' the culture and people who live in there. To earn wider perspective through the trip, I think longer period is needed. Furthermore, not for traveling, learning a new knowledge also needs long time. If we plan to learn new thing during the lifetime, it is much better to plan and succeed it through a long period. It also could be the vacation searching for a new vision by learning about different majors. Lastly, if we want to experience a social activity like intern, we need to get long vacation. There are many peoples who want to start social activity when they are in the undergraduate, and those activities usually acquires long time. To sum up, I propose having long vacation, because it gives time with higher quality with various activities."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

It is undeniable that every student loves it. Though, when it comes to specifications, the thing seems to be quite controversial. Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. On the other hand, others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. For my opinion, it is better to have several short vacations. First of all, several short vacations enable students more relaxation. Why do we need vacation? Quite simple. Main purpose of the vacation is to give students time of relaxation and chance of new learnings at home, which are much different from that obtained from school. Some may reckon that one long vacation seems to ensure it better. In reality, it is not. Imagine that you have to study at school for a long long time. Or.. imagine that you must stay at home for a long long period, like quarantine. It should be dreadful whether it is school or home. Second, in reality, there are numerous problems. So far, in Republic Of Korea, most schools have given students several and short vacations which I've argued. Hard to change these conventional policies. For those reasons, I think that it is far better to give students short and several vacation times. It will be good choice for not only students, but all the peoples who are related to education."	3.5	3.5	4	11

Every time the vacation is almost over, we often wish the vacation was longer, and we regret we could do more other things during the vacation. However, I think that I can do much more with short vacations than one long vacation and it will be even more helpful to prepare for the next semester, so I think it is better to have several short vacations than one long vacation. First of all, we can enjoy more when there are many short vacations. If there is only one vacation, it will be only in one season, summer or winter. Then, we can't play diverse sports. In my case, when I was a high school student, I could experience various things such as playing in the water in Saipan in summer and skiing in winter at Kangwondo. Not only these sports but also foods vary from season to season. Several short vacations spent eating warm food in the winter and cool food in the summer will be better than one long vacation with similar feelings each time. Secondly, short and many vacations can prepare for the next semester more fruitful than a long one. From the point of view of studying, which is one of the student's duties, it is said that short and multiple breaks increase concentration more than one long break. In other words, we can set more specific goals for the upcoming semester over several vacations, and we can take the next semester with a new mindset after each break. For example, during the vacation, I can make specific plans about what I lack, what I need more, and what I have to study, and since the vacation is not long, I can take a break and continue studying without getting tired. To summarize, short and many vacations are much useful for students than one long vacation. It is better to have several short vacations in that we can rest in more diverse ways during vacation. Besides this, it would be better to have short vacations that we don't lose our concentration and preparing for the next semester. It would be nice to have a longer vacation right now, but if you have a wider view, you will know how good short and many vacations are."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

I think vacation makes students work better during semester. So it is important to take enough extra curricular experience and take a rest. For these activity, vacation should be more often and a little shorter. I will explain why it is important. First, several short vacation makes student feel refreshed all year around. If students have only one vacation in a year, the students' academic efficiency will be decreased during semester because of the stress from test and homework. However, if students have several vacation, they will be refreshed often before burned out. And it will make their academic productivity better. Second, long vacation makes students forget last semester and be lazy. But when they have short vacation, students will not forget their last semester. So it is easy to come back to school's routine and follow the academic course again. Also, during short acation, students' bio-rythme is not be ruined so much. So students can come back to school's schedule easily. At last, short vacation makes sutdent enjoy various part of the year. For example, if students have only long summer vacation, they cannot enjoy thanks giving in fall, Christmas in winter and flower blooming in spring. This can ruin one people's life in school year. However, when there are several short vacations, students can join family's meeting in thanks giving and Chirstmas, and can enjoy summer vacation and party in spring. Moreover, this is not just for enjoying life. All these events with nature inspire students' research or other things. In short, several short vacations are good for students' coming back to school, inspiration and refreshment. It will be awkward at first, but as time goes, you can be sure for the positivity. Let's give students several short vacations."	3.5	3.5	3	10

Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.    	"Vacations are critical in school life. In vacations, students can rest, reorganize, and study the lectures in next semester. Nowadays in Korea, two long vacations are given for each year, which are summer vacation and winter vacation. However, some people say that many short vacations are better than one long vacations. I agree with this argument. Instead of few long vacations, students should have a lot of short vacations. First, excessively long vacations are minus for students. If the length of vacation is more than 1 month, than many students may forget the information they had learn. Also, their study attitude and habits can be messed up during the long vacations. These can affect students in the bad way. Next, during the long semester, students must need some breaks. In Korea, the length of semester is almost 4 months. These are too much for growing children. They need some breaking periods during these semesters. If these breaking periods do not exist, then students can be easily tired off and may encounter burn-out. I think that two 1-month vacations(for summer and winter each) and four 2-weeks vacations for each year are good for students. In summer and winter, because of climates and temperatures, at least 1-month vacations must be given. But I think that 1 month is sufficient for these vacations. Also these vacations will be located between different semesters. During one semester, students need breaking periods. So I think that two 2-weeks vacations are appropriate for one semester. Then totally we have two 1-month vacations and four 2-weeks vacations in each year."	3.5	3.5	3	10

Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.    	"Having several short vacations throughout the year is better than one long vacation. There are Three reasons why I think like this. First, I think the most important reason why students have vacations is to take a rest and recharge their body and mind. If there are only one vacation through one year, semester would be very long and it makes students exhausted during the semester. So those students have lower will to study. But If there are several vacations, students can have free times for a couple of months between the semester. By this short vacation, students can have a rest or get their own free time before students get exhausted. Second, a long term vacation can disturb our focus on study. After the 4~5 months vacation, students are used to have a rest and meet friends or take a trip during long vacation so they can't focus on their study immediately. Also they might forget something related to their study so they have to learn that one more time. In contrast, during the short term such as 1~2 month vacation students are less likely to forget their knowledge and it is easy to get back on semester. Lastly, students can have more meaningful time during short vacation. If vacations are too long, people tend to delay their tasks because they think they can do those things after rest. But only 1~2 months are given to students, they would make a plan to use those time fruitful because it seems short. They can study what they want to know, have an internship program, or go travel. In conclusion, short vacation are good for student's efficiency and they can focus after short vacation. Also short vacations make students to have more meaningful vacations."	4	3.5	3.5	11

Some people may argue that higher education is not for everybody, but university gives lots of advantages for students who want to learn. First of all, university provides specific major subjects, which is not taught in high school. For example, KAIST has Industrial Design major courses with semi-professional equipment such as 3D printers. At university, people can use expensive but efficient machines to try out. Next, collage life itself is a special experience. Some students can performance poorly in academic parts, but that is not everything you learn in college life. In collage, you can make diverse friends and learn different cultures. You can get special lectures from scientist to filmmaker. Finally, college system has lots of advantages in encouraging students' academic performance and future career. There is more chance to get scholarship in collage. Undergraduate research programs helps students who want to research. It is easier to get internship because you have more information. Everybody who wants to get higher education should get it without being judged. There are many departments specialized in subjects. Collage life experience is not replaceable. University helps studying and developing future career path. According to these advantages, college or university education should be available to anyone."	3.5	3	3	9.5

So many high school students who want to go to university can go to university even it is high level or not. So there are so many graduated people in the Korean society. I think it is not very good phenomenon for the society. First of all, societies' human sources would be simplized. There are many jobs in society, and humans need to do different roles in society. Although there are many kinds of majors in university, people would be similar when they get similar education in university. So there would be a lack of human in some part of the society because nobody can do that role and it has negative effect to the whole society. Second, higher education means the higher level of the high school's education. So it should be provided to students who successfully understand the high school's education. I think the university's higher education is the prize of the effort of the high school's education. Lastly, the quality of the university's education would be decrease when many students are taking it. Because professors of the universities should take care of lots of students,, they cannot take care of each student more, and the class would be much bigger. Even though there are some good big classes, big classes cannot get better qualities than smaller classes. So it could be a negative effect to the whole students. Even though I'm in KAIST and getting great education of the university so my opinion to this topic may seems selfish, I think university education should has advantages to the some good students."	3.5	3	3	9.5

There are several reasons that support my view. First, I think that there is no proper way to select ""good"" students. Some students, who have enough money, are already available with great education while others don't. Therefore, evaluating students to give a higher education itself would be unfair. Students who already can get high-quality education will easily pass the exam for evaluation. Secondly, higher education have to be provided to students who WANT to study more, not to students who are GOOD at studying. Everyone has the right to learn what they want to learn. It makes a much larger possible choices for people to select a right job. That diversity helps to form a creative and happy society. Some people may say that giving an lecture or providing various resources requires too much money to be available to all students. They insist that it is simply not effective. However, I think that the cost can be reduced by recording lecture video and provide it or just encourage students collaborate on studying. I also think that the social benefits that comes after good education are much greater than the cost. Everyone has the right to learn to make their lives better. Society have to support members to study and select a job that they really want. Therefore, it is essential that higher education can be accessible to all people."	4	3.5	3.5	11

In my opinion, college or university education do not have to available to all students. First of all, some students do not have enough money to pay for college education. In other words, expensive college tuition are burden to them. Taking jobs without entering to college could be more appropriate way for them. But if social culture force them to enroll to college, they may regret about decision in future. Secondly, not all people needs college education for their living. There are uncountable jobs in world, and only part of them requires advanced skills or studies for work. For example, Office jobs or lots of service jobs do not requires college education. For them, enroll to college could be too luxury of time and money. Finally, not all students in college are interested in their lecture. I saw many students who sleep or playing with their smartphones during class. In other word, some students in college are already do not interest in their major. They could learn what they want to outside of university such as Internet or group study. Sum up, there are lots of people who can not taking college education or do not need to taking it. For those people, college education do not have to be essential. It have to remain as advanced course which is for students who desire for more studies after high school."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

"Some survey with high school students and their parents shows that they think college or university educations are important in their life. Many middle school and high school(maybe elementary!) students study very hard to enter the college or university that they want. Importance of high educational process that they think doesn't mean college or university education really need to all of them. However, available to enter college or university is another argue. All of students don's need higher education with college or university, but if they want to high education, they can get the chance to learn. First of all, by college and university's purpose, to educate, higher education can be available to students that want to study with them. 'Good students' that college and university think is not clearly. Are they kind? Are they smart? Good students are determined just convenience of college or university. It is unfair, there are more better available policy, just want to higher education. Second, there are too many college and university. If only good student can enter college and university, most of college and university can't provide educational service with stable quality cause lack of students so lack of money that need to making contents of lecture, etc. More, higher education like lecture, lab session, etc need to some student for operate that like make question, tests(small quiz or exam, ...), so on. Education with no students is not meaningful. Entering the college or university is very confused problem in Korea. Many students who prepare to enter college or university thinks its very complicate and stressful issues. May college or university educations are available to all students that want to higher education, it make solution for that problems, and be nice for students and higher educational company in Korea."	3.5	3	3.5	10

We do not have to go classroom and need physical space. So, it is easy to share education for all students. Second, it can grow up expert. One university can not provide all classes that someone need. For example, KAIST does not have professor who study fish. For raising expertise, we have to participate various classes from various universities. If, all students are available to higher education, they can watch what they need and raise expertise for their job. Third, there is no perfect way to select good students. All nobel prize winner do not come from harvard or standford. We can not identify students untill they actually work. All people have their own potential and it is not esay to check. If all students can learn higher educaion, they can grow their hidden potential and know what they really like and they are good at."	3.5	3	3	9.5

Even if they don't have any knowledge and get poor score, it's their choice not to go to class. Second, class' condition would be better. If there are students who don't want to go to class, they can use phone or chat with friends. However, if students who want to go to class only go to class, they would concentrate on class. And it also makes other students to concentrate on class. Third, attendance check actually can't measure students' effort to study class' topic. By attendance, we can only check that students come to class. We can't check what students' actually do in class. For these reasons, going to classes should be optional for students."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

"There are various types of people and standard to categorize individual's characteristic, and amount of knowledge or taste can be one of them. On my perspective based on above, we should offer university education for all people, but only whom want learning, using open source or open lecture. Every people are deserve to require knowledge for inhancing their skills, not just bounded in high level technology or complex philosophy. Some people might love handling flowers or others love sports. Refer to my relatives' experiment, they study their interest respectively by Youtube. I tried to find lectures for them from open-lecture archiving sites such as KMOOC, they do not contain entertainment major lectures. And I wondered why entertain relative subjects are not well organized as like as engineering or literature. Second reason that I side on educating all students is because I believe all people have potential to become a components of society by learning. I've seen a article which a chinese delivery man had solved difficult math problem that mathematic institute also tried. This is called as chinese version 'Good Will Hunting'. We do not know where or when to uncover genious people. I completely agree to offer university education for all students even they are not good on their field. Of course it might cause some problems. And on my view, the best way to solve it is open source or open lecture."	3	3	3.5	9.5

However, I think it is unfair that such higher education meant to be given just for good students. Let me introduce some reasons. First of all, of course, there can be a lot of difference in the speed of learning, so we should admit the fact and not have a system that seems to ignore it. Maybe all of us know that we are really aware of the pains of culture or history that are suppressed from learning that we cannot study just because we are not good at studying. And most importantly, the desire to study and doing well are distinctly different. I think the institution for high-level education is just a place for learning, but not a stadium which judges grades or students. Anyone who is eager to learn, their skills or abilities should not block their wishes to learn. Concluding, I claim that the education from college or university must be free for every students who has a passion for studying. Colleges and universities are aimed at academics, not evaluations, and should not be tolerated, even if there are differences in the speed of learning. I hope that every students who wants to learn about their interest should be given rights for study."	3	3	3.5	9.5

First, college doesn't ensure you a good education. Highly rated good universities may have good professors and good facilities to teach students, but when too many students go to university, there eventually exists some universities that doesn't have enough ability to teach students well. In those cases, college doesn't focus on teaching students, but only focus on earning money and make university rich instead. In worst case, when those university fail to bring students, they may go to bankrupt. In fact, in Korea, about 5 universities disappear a year because of this reason. Second, college may not give enough help for our life. Some jobs like blue-collar jobs doesn't require higher education. Of course most of students who goes to university may want white collar jobs or jobs that earn lot of money, but compared to good students, students of lower ability have pretty low chance of getting them. So when they go to college, they may waste 4 years for learning informations that wouldn't be probabilly used for whole life. Third, money is a huge issue too. Normal universities unlike KAIST offers great amount of money from their students. In US, it is a huge issue because lots of students have to spend their 20's to return money they've lent from bank for university. If most student goes to university, there will be lots of people in poverty who can't sustain to pay that money, and will cause social problem. In order to solve those problem, university need good scholarship system like KAIST, but if there are too many students, it is hard to provide those benefits to student. However if only good students go to university, we can easily construct those system and benefit good students. For these reasons, I think that there is no need for every students to go to university."	4	3.5	3.5	11

There are two reasons below. First, Giving higher education to all students can be ineffective and unaffective. There must be some students who are not interested in studying and even who don't want to study. For those kinds of students, higher education might be meaningless. The asset used for making higher education available for all students can be used in more properly, for students who wants more education and students who doesn't want it. Secondly, it is very difficult to run the policy (higher education of all students). As you know, fee for unversity or college education is so expensive. Can the government pay all of the money for all students? If you think about a policy, making half the enrollment fee of colleges/universities, you can recognize that it is very difficult to run the policy. In short, I do not agree with higher education for all students. The first reason is ineffectiveness and unaffectiveness, and the second reason is that running the policy is difficult, there is little proability to run it. There must be other proper way to support and care all students."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

However, there are still some people who think a college or university education should be available to all students. In my opinion, higher education should be available only to good students, and here are some reasons support it. First, it is more efficient. The goal of the college or university education is promoting and raising skilled experts to improve and develop our society. To do that, it cost a lot of money. Even if we afford all student, it's obvious most of them won't be able to reach the degree that the society want, so waste of money and time occur when the college or university education is available for any students. Second, it promotes students to think about their future. Because there are certain condition or details to get certain education, individual students should think about what they are good at, and what they love to do. It helps students to know about themselves better, which is establishment of solid and constructive ego. In conclusion, I think there should be certain condition for higher education because it is more efficient and promotes students to think about their future, which help students to become mentally healthy adults."	4	3.5	4	11.5

"There Should be a Limit for University Education In these days, people try hard from middle school to go to good universities. So if we gave everybody a chance to get university education, most people would stop trying and it would be harmful to the ones who studied hard. If we allow everyone to get college education no matter their behavior, people wouldn't try hard thinking they can learn later on and stop studying hard. Nowadays, students study for university, but if we remove this purpose, students won't study. This will lead to society become foolish. Opening university to everyone is also a problem for those who studied hard. As anyone can attend to class, the atmosphere of the class will become bad and the quality will be also downgraded. We would also have to lower the level of difficulty which would make good students learn less. In conclusion, we have to build a wall for college education as it is no good for society and good students to make the university open. So we should make a limit for college education. "	3	3	3.5	9.5

Space industry has kept developing since mankind first stepped on the moon. Various countries still invest massive amount of money on space industry; for example, U.S. spent 10 billion dollars for exploring outer space on 2020. (ref I) Despite the opinion that the budget for exploring outer space is a waste of money, governments should keep investing on space industry for two reasons.
First of all, the space industry leads the frontline of the technologies. The technology for exploring outer space has widely applied to daily life. According to (ref II), it is suggested that various daily products are based on space technologies: example 1, 2, 3. By allocating the budget for outer space, the life on Earth can be improved efficiently.
In addition to advanced technology, the space industry enables alternative dwelling options for future. Total population has increased exponentially, and it is reported to exceed 500,000,000 in ten years. (ref III) Outer space can be good alternatives for Earth to afford massive populations; for example, Mars are planned to be developed for future residence in SpaceX. (ref IV)
Although the space industry gives various benefits, some argues that the space industry is waste of money. 
In conclusion, the governments spend plenty of money on space industry to improve the life in present and future. The technologies in space industry are not only useful for outer space, but also necessary for daily life. The investment of governments should be increased gradually to lead the technology."	4	4.5	4.5	13

Human beings know little about the universe, and curiosity about such unknowns are the driving force of our lives. In the past, the United States and the Soviet Union fought their own wars by who conquered the universe first, so the Soviet Union created the first satellite and the United States created the first moon exploration. People all over the world cheered for human advancement into space and created their imagination like various sci-fi films and books. Just as movies like 'Martian', 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek' depict humanity living in space, they constantly that desire to go into space; however, there are some argue that why they should explore space. Nevertheless, in my opinion, exploring space helps the entire human beings for three reasons.
First of all, the Earth is increasingly losing its function as a home for life, and people needs a new place for humanity to live. Rapidly growing of Human beings, reckless resource development and natural destruction make the Earth die. The Amazon forest, which is called Earth's lungs and produces fresh oxygen, has destroyed much of it and is still being cut down. Climate change is happening all over the world, and the climate that we've adapted to is changing, so it's a big mess in people's farming. Exploring the universe is expanding human habitation. An extraterrestrial asteroid has abundant mineral resources, and an extraterrestrial planet with water and oxygen. NASA plans to set up manned space bases on Mars and the moon, and humans will have a place of residence where they can escape in the event of a major disaster on Earth.
Furthermore, exploring space is the greatest preparation to prevent the extinction of mankind. Just a few months ago, a big asteroid hit the Earth. There are hundreds of millions of asteroids in the universe. It is smaller than the Earth or the moon, and travels through space. The larger the planet, the greater its gravity, which in other words attracts objects around it. If there is an asteroid that passes around the Earth, the Earth will pull it in and if it is large enough, the Earth will be shocked and even destroyed. We need to develop enough technology to explore the universe to prevent this destruction of humanity.
Some argue that space exploration costs too much, despite that opinion, it makes money. Among the technologies developed by NASA for space exploration, there are many things that make up a big part of our lives. In particular, computers were first developed for space exploration, and fabrics used in space suits brought about the development of clothing. So this has resulted in the same amount of money that we spent on space exploration.
In conclusion, human space exploration is essential for the human race's big leap forward. It is also to prevent the earth from being devastated and to prevent mankind from becoming extinct. We have to explore the universe at all costs."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

That is the reason that the worlds focus on exploring technologies which needs a lot of money. The money usually comes from government to enhance their technology; however, several aspects shows that the government should invest more money on daily than exploring outer space. 
First of all, governments manage too much things to invest specific technology. For instance, they control supporting money for COVID19, the over expansion of house price, and the rights for everything that we face on. In fact, the government increase their investing money for supporting money as 57% for their citizens in Seoul (Lee). It obviously shows that they do not have any resources to invest for exploring outer space. 
The second aspect is about the private subjects of investigators that decrease the responsibility of government investigation. In now day, private investigators become common to find on every fields. For example, the money from private investigators increases as 16% on space technology than last year, and the invested field of same technology becomes 11% larger than just 6 months (Hoffman). Also, there was amazing news about success of launching the rocket of private subjects. Two evidence shows that they are enough to investigate, so the government is not only the main subject but also privates are.
Some people argue that the government can enhance the efficiency of research, but it is not true. According to Research Lab, they shows the result that the project from government had less efficiency on economic factors as 25% (Kim). The fact shows that they participate non effective researches, so they should not decrease efficiency.
The government do not have to investigate specific technology. What they should do is to encourage private subjects, and manage daily things, and do not participate much on non effective researches. This is the mandatory to enhance both our life and technology."	4.5	4	4	12.5

Countries are responsible of many things for their public such as education, health, and transportation. Some think that governments should spend as much money as possible exploring other planets. Other disagree and believe that governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. In my opinion, it is better for governments to spend this money for the public without exploring outer space for several reasons.
First of all, governments have a duty to protect the health of its people. Despite the advances in medical technology, many people died because infections, cancer, and other new diseases. Therefore, the government should pay attention about patients and medical insurance or environment.  COVID 19, a global epidemic, is an example of this. A report by 'The Korea News' said that South Korea covered all medical expenses for the public in Corona crisis. Like this, governments are interest in health care for their people always.
The second reason is that governments should make their people live more comfortably. The people who live in a country said their inconvenience in their lives like transportation, house, or taxes to the government. Governments should divide their budget properly to various national policies.
Many argue that exploring outer space is needed to abandon the polluted earth and find a new place to live; however, governments should prevent the contamination of the earth.
To sum up, government should try to use their budget for the people on earth."	4	4.5	4.5	13

"	"Recently, a debate regarding whether governments should spend money for exploring outer space or for our basic needs on Earth has been brought upon. Some claims that exploring the other planets can be helpful to our descendant, and the others emphasize the lack of our basic needs on Earth. While a large population may assert that discovering the unknown space can solve the uncertainties of future, such notion should be highly reconsidered. Without doubt, investing capital to our Earth have essential benefits. 
First, protecting the Earth's environment should be a priority. The basic needs of mankind come from nature, and humanity has ruined the natural environment too much. For example, too many glaciers in the Arctic are destroyed, and the Amazon rain forest has burned too much. Therefore, these destruction led to the inability to obtain basic needs.
What is more compelling is that government financial support can save citizens. Money is necessary for life because the fundamental needs can be earned by the money. For instance, citizens in developing countries are not able to buy even basic drinking water and food shortages. 
Some argue that the future uncertainties can be overcome by finding new resources in outer space. This contention is based on high probabilities of success. To rebut opponents’ claim, discovering new resources outside the Earth is a very rare probability and has never been successful. In fact, a sizable number of populace can be saved with that huge capital, and Earth still has a large amount of resources. Accordingly, capital should be invested for our basic needs of Earth in terms of probability.
To sum up, these advantages suggest using capital for basic needs of mankind is needed. Turning your view into the Earth, not outside the Earth can be proper and reasonable."	4.5	4	4.5	13

Nowadays, people study hard about outer space. They have lunched lots of space ships and have sent lots of people to outer space. Although some people say that governments should spend the money for our basic needs on Earth instead of exploring outer space, governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space for several reasons.
First of all, materials are limited on Earth. Until now, human used lots of materials, such as steel, gasoline, etc. Because of limitation, there will be no materials to use in future. For example, oil is one of the most significant fuel on Earth. People have used tremendous oil for development and convenience, and the estimated amount of oil is not much remained on Earth. Unless people find out other replacement of oil on Earth, exploring outer space is inevitable.
The second reason is a land. Thanks to improvement of technologies, population have rapidly increased; therefore, human will lack of a living land in future.

Exploring outer space such as traveling to the Moon and to other planets have been funded and made some progress in history. There are two side of view among people; some say the governments in the world should keep investing in this space traveling, but others say the Earth problem is more urgent for wasting money on space research. In my opinion, the governments have to focus on the issues happening in our planet for following three reasons.
First, it is skeptical that the governments will make profit or find a possibility of space development. There have been a bunch of historical researches on the space, and many astronauts have been to the Moon, also many small space probes have been sent to the space. Despite the endeavors to find something in the space, the scientists rather found there is nothing special in the Sun system. Furthermore, even if we try to go to another system of planets, or out of the Sun system, it is found that exiting the Sun system takes more than 20 years. Who would travel that far distance sacrificing one's whole life?
In addition, instead of investing in space traveling, we need to focus more on the Earth crisis. we don't have enough time and money just to deal with the Earth problems. Look at how many people are still in hunger, how many cities are in inequality. The human crisis and environmental crisis must be the first to tackle. Human will end up keeping living on the Earth, so the governments need to solve the global warming, giving money to sustainable energy research programs.
Some might say that the governments should spend money on the space just for academic purpose; However, it is not desirable to spend public resources on academic hunger of few people. In addition, the human has achieved remarkable knowledge in the past decades; in other words, there is few thing left human can easily find with less money because human already know most of principles in the Universe. Human have already sent telescope, probes in the space, and more than ten people have been to the Moon. The governments have to think about the efficiency of a new project on the space.
It is clear that spending money on the space is not desirable than focusing on dealing with the Earth issues. A new space project is unlikely to give us new achievements, and there are many Earth crisis which is ongoing and urgent. Space investments have been enough, and the governments faced a clear limit to the hope of finding something in the space. It is time to focus more on the current issues in our living ground; human will eventually ended up staying on the Earth."	5	4.5	4.5	14

It has long been a human dream to explore the earth. Eventually, humanity could reach the moon, but no one has ever gone to the moon since more than 20 years ago. Even related budgets are being cut a lot. This is because exploring outer space is not very helpful to human. There are two reasons for spending this money for our basic needs on Earth.
First of all, exploring outer space requires a great deal of money, but the benefits of this are not clear. What people can get right now through space exploration is just scientific progress. Some claim that these advances can bring resources from space or move to new planets outside of Earth, so it is worth spending a lot of money. However, people don't know how much it will benefit, or even whether it can be realized. Everything about space exploration is just a probability. Rather than space exploration, people should focus on solving many problems that human needs to be solve; plague, war, hunger poverty and climate change.
The next reason is that human has not yet fully grasped the Earth. For example, people have said that oil will run out soon after decades ago. However, the advances in technology have uncovered new oil fields and found alternatives such as oil sands; therefore, oil is still abundant and reserves are unpredictable. In addition, people do not know the sea too. Most of the Earth's deep sea is completely unknown. Recently, people use submarines for exploring deep sea, so can get information little by little. There are a lot of things people need to know about the Earth to look out.
To sum it up, space exploration is expensive and the benefits are unclear. Instead, focusing on the Earth will still have some unknown places to explore and help solve many of human's problems. This will rather serve as a stepping stone for future space exploration, resulting in better results."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

Basically, science fiction is based on scientific facts, but it also contains some scientific errors. Some scientists believe that wrong scientific knowledge, which is widely spread, is because of science fiction. For example, many people believe that there are many minerals or resources to use in outer space; that's not true. Government should spend money for our basic needs on Earth rather than space exploration with two reasons.
  First of all, using resources in outer space is inefficient. NASA or other organizations found some planets which have resources. However, according to NASA, it takes over thousands year to reach, even the speed of spaceship reaches to light. Even they found other planets within easy distance, the cost for movement and collection in outer space is more expensive than on Earth. There is no economic benefit to go outer space.
Next, space is mostly unknown and dangerous. There are many harms that we already know: thin air, strong ultraviolet rays, black holes, and so on. Even discoveries accompany sacrifices, that can be useless death. Also, research for the space are unclear before they confirm the appearance through their own eyes. Investment to those uncertain development is wrong.
Some people said that development of  space technology would make the exploration more efficient. However, there is a limitation. According to Einstein, every materials' speed is limited until the speed of light. Therefore, we cannot make any spaceships that can move over the light speed, which means time for migration between outer planet will not decrease dramatically.
To sum up, development of outer space technology is inefficient and uncertain. On the other hand, it's possible to solve the poverty and cure the incurable illnesses by using that budget. There are many other unsolved problems on Earth. Humankind should solve these problems before the development of outer space. It might be more helpful to humankind."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

Several people think that governments should not spend money on exploring outer space. However, governments should invest in exploring outer space including making another planet the colony and gathering resources. There are three apparent reasons why governments should do such works.
First of all, the earth is a restricted planet. Even if there are enough resources that 7 billion people can use now, it will not be the case in the future. Futurists say that the population will keep growing. If it comes to be true, the lack of resources will call a disaster. In the movie; The Avengers, Thanos has a mission to eliminate 50% of the population since he saw how lack of resources called the disaster on his planet, Titan. If people do not invest in outer space, the story in the movie will come true.
The next reason is the historical fact that humans had developed so far doing researches. Everyone blamed the person who invented cars. No one tried to use expensive and heavy cars while there are horses. However, the invention of the car changed the world. If people hesitate to invest in a larger area, it will be the end of human development history. Even if it is scary to invest money in a mystery place, it will return more than invested money.
A number of people think that investing money in outer space is useless. However, this is not true. There are too many things that made life better since there was an investment in outer space. For example, GPS can be possible since there is 24 satellite in outer space. It might seem like investing billion dollars to rockets are insane. However, if there was no investment in a rocket, there will be no GPS and navigation that made a number of things possible including saving people with location tracking. 
In conclusion, there are obvious reasons why governments should invest in outer space: limited resources, to develop, and application. People have to see further to make humans great. If they only try to seek short happiness, the only thing that waits for them is a long depression."	4	4	4.5	12.5

As the technology develops, the desire for the outer space is getting stronger. It was successful for recent days; humans can go to the moon and other planets, and they come back to Earth safely. Furthermore, it looks possible to use the area of the planets and sources of them. However, to access that stage, more money is needed for research and there is a debate whether using much more money to exploring outer space is right or not. Some says that exploring planets is the hope of the Earth, but it looks irrational. The money should be used for people on Earth now.
One reason is that no one cannot assure the success of this project. No one knows about the environment and sources of the planet exactly. If the project fails by unexpected factors, then who can recover the money? It will be the responsibility of the people in Earth; moreover, no one knows if it can be recovered. Money for exploring planets is not small one to gamble, so it is desirable to use them to the Earth.
Another reason is that there exists so many people in need. Those people is now living so hard and waiting for help. Poorly, they cannot eat sufficient food and drink water; also, people in disease cannot be treated because they don't have enough sources. There is no strong reason to ignore them and research for the planter. While the research is ongoing, most of them will die. Therefore, rather than looking for distant planets, taking care of neighborhoods would be more urgent.
Some says that the life of the Earth is not long enough, but it is not true. Supporters for exploring planets insists the short life of Earth for the climate other signals of the Earth that can be seen in normal days. It looks serious, but it is the consequence of humans: factory, artificial ingredients, trash etc. It can be seen that the atmosphere changes one the factory stops for few days. Therefore, the signal for short life can disappear by stopping some factories and other pollutants. 
There is no doubt that the people in Earth now are more important than the exploring the planets in future with unknown possibility. To regret, there have been minimal efforts to saving the Earth in governments; thus, the effort for saving Earth and the people in Earth should be the first assignment. Exploring the planets would be the next."	4.5	4	4	12.5

Until now, hum has been living pioneering the earth, and among them, there have been difficult environments to live in, such as deserts and jungles. And now, humanity is going on a outer space exploration. The Soviet Union was the first in the world to travel to space, and the United States was the first to land on the moon. However, some people say that spending money for basic needs on Earth is more important than exploring outer space.The debate continues, but exploring outer space should be continued for these three main reasons.
First of all, there are not many resources left on Earth. During the long period of human living, resources have been used continuously, so there are not enough resources left on Earth. Because the lack of resources is coming, human must replenish resources from outer space.
In addition to lack of resources, population growth is also a problem. In modern times, the population is exploding, so the earth is narrowing; people do not have enough space to live. In order to get a space to live comfortably, exploring outer space is necessary.
Opposites say that exploring outer space is too early, and there are much time to prepare the problems like lack of resources and population growth. However, exploring outer space is high technology, so to complete the exploring outer space, scientists and engineers need enormous time and money. Because of that,  exploring outer space should be continued.
To sum up, exploring outer space must keep going for human's future. Many problems remain with humanity, such as lack of resources and population growth. Human need much time and money to solve these problems. To solve these problems, human should explore outer space."	4.5	4	4	12.5

As the science technologies improved, the 열정 of people to explore to space is going up dramatically. Also, naturally, the curiosity about whether if there is a planet to live or not in the space is going up. Consequently, some people think that spending money to explore the space is strongly needed for us. However, in my opinion, I think the government should spend less money in near future and spend more to people.
First of all, finding new planet is not too urgent issue now. People might need to find new place to live outside of earth in the future; but these days, it is not necessary yet. Even though some people are urging about the lack of resources, the earth still has a lot yet: such as coal, water, and food. Thus, exploring the space to find new territory is too early to consider.
Moreover, there are a lot of problems to solve currently. Recently, the virus named COVID-19 has spread over the earth, and numerous of people are dying even now. Also, there was a nuclear issue in all over the world. These kind of problems are hard to solve; but, they are the thumbs of the problem which the governments take care. Therefore, exploring space must not be the first to the government. 
Last but not least, too much money is required to explore in space. In spite of the statements above, the exploration to the space is needed for the improvement of science. However, they need a huge amount of money in general. Thus, it is not too late if the government try to explore the space when they have sufficient money.
To sum up, to explore the space is not too urgent issue, and instead, there are some problems to the earth to solve now. Add, the amount of money to explore the space is too much for the countries now. It is also the important to find new planets and to study the space, but there are a lot of problems to focus on. By these reasons, the government should use the money to the earth."	4.5	4	4	12.5

At that time, it is a big issue that humans go to the moon for the first time, and now, many countries try to go to Mars which is the new target. To progress this project, there a lot of money is needed; besides, governments only can support money. Spending as much money as possible exploring outer space is necessary and there are three main reasons. 
First, the result of research about outer space will be precious property to the country. In the past, people could not think people can talk with people who leave far; however, now people can do this through science development. Science technology becomes an important resource for the country now. Just like this, in the future, technology about going to the other planets or moon may be strong points to the country, and that country may be a strong country in the world. 
Second, there is an honor to the country that makes the first result of space. These days all of the students in the world learn that American people went to the moon for the first time. Many media such as movie and books says about this. Like this, if one country success to go to the other planet in the future, all of the people in the world know about this. This is honor to the country and this honor will be a strong point to the economy and society because of the global period.
Other people can think governments can save their country a person with this money. However, if governments think the present only, that country will go to the behind other countries. Technology about another planet is a high technology and this will be competitiveness with the country. The country will be hard when only other countries get high technology because they have to pay to get learn their thechnology."	4	4	4	12

Governments can spend money for transportation. They can support infrastructure like roads and highways, or they can support public transportation like buses, trains, and subways. In my opinion, governments should improve public transportation for three main reasons.
First of all, public transportation makes less environmental pollution. Improving infrastructure causes increasing private transportation; therefore, harmful gas is increasing in air. This gas can make critical pollution to environment. On the other hand, increasing public transportation makes less harmful gas. It will be good for environment.
In addition to environment, public transportation is economical. One public transportation can transport lots of people. In this case, less amount of money should be needed to resolve traffic problem. Moreover, even though increasing roads or highways is hard to construct, public transportation can be easily increased. Thus, public transportation saves more money.
Some argue that improving infrastructure is efficient way to resolve traffic problem. They say increasing roads or highways makes much more traffic capacity. However, since territory is limited, improving infrastructure also has limit. Public transportation can be increased continuously without regarding limit of territory. That is, public transportation is efficient way to increase traffic capacity.
To sum up, public transportation has three strengths: environment, economics, and efficiency. Of course, governments should spend money on both infrastructure and public transportation. However, if governments' money is limited, improving public transportation should be a priority."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

"	"In most countries, the government collects taxes from the people and develops various things for the public good through the collected taxes. For example, the government improving highways, subways and buses with money which collected from people. This development provides transportation services to the people. Should the government spend more money on roads or public transportation? The government has to spend more money on public transportation development for two main reason.
First of all, the development of public transportation is more environmentally friendly than the development of roads and highways. Development of roads and highways is, after all, an encouragement of personal use of the car. When the same number of people in one area move to another area, using public transportation consumes less energy than when they use their own car. In particular, car fumes is an important factor in environmental pollution. 
Secondly, there is a difference in the number of people who benefit from development. Only people with private vehicles benefit from road and highway development. However, public transportation can be used by people who do not have their own vehicles. Therefore, the government should focus on the development of public transportation so as not to discriminate people according to they have or have not vehicles.
On the other hands,  there is a argue that public transportation has no economic advantage than highways. However, the development of public transportation has cultural advantage because it provides transportation services to many people.
To sum up, there are two reason public transportation development is more better. One reason is for environmental, the other reason is that many people can benefit. Therefore the government should focus and spend more money on improving public transportation."	4	4	4	12

All over the world, the population concentrated area usually has traffic problem; therefore, it is obvious that governments of the each countries have to present solution. The Korea is also facing the same problem. Especially, metropolises like Seoul and Busan are always criticized the claim. Thus, some argue that the Korean governments should spend more money on improving public transportation for a solution about the problem; however, in my opinion, more important direction of solution is increasing budget to improve roads and highways for two reasons: the roads of the large cities already full and tendency of the Korean do not head public transportation.
First, The roads, include highway, already fully filled by cars. Usually, the cause of the Korean transportation problem is traffic. Because the people normally take more than one car per one family, not only big cities, but also highway and other cities has traffic problem. In fact, the main highway that links Seoul and Busan easily shows heavy traffics. So, what the government should do is expanding capacity, not increasing number of new public transportation. 
Some argue that the increased individual transportation should be suppressed and increasing of using public transportation is required; however, public transportation cannot replace their own car. The public transportation should drive to follow specific time line and selected course. In this condition, it is hard to move appropriately when the emergency happens. For example, someone hurts, and the time for waiting 911 is not enough, public transportation cannot answer the question. Needs of own car is strongly demanded, and it is hard to replace. 
To sum up, the Korean massive transportation problem needs to be solved soon with expanding roads,"	4	4	4	12

Recently, cities are being more and more bigger and complicated. People tend to like the cities because the cities have more infra than the countryside. This phenomena is noticeable for the big cities; for example, Seoul, New York, and Beijing are complicated. Therefore, the traffic problems are appearing in those countries which have big cities, and there is two big different views. Although some say governments should spend more money on the roads and highways, I would say public transportation is more important in terms of three points.
First of all, the population is growing in world-wide. Human beings have improved agriculture methods and medical knowledges, and this makes the population pop-up from the 100 million to the 700 million. Increasing so fast, human beings are gathering up together and make the big city. The city with a huge population have also a big area, so people needs transportation to move on. Therefore, the government should build more public transportation to solve this.
The following reason for the population problem is traffic problem. In these days, almost every families have their own cars. Without the public transportations, they definitely ride their vehicles when they are going shopping or going to work. This induces a terrible traffic jam during every morning and evening. However, If there are enough public transports, less cars go out to the roads and less traffic jam will be happened.
The opponents will insist that building more roads can solve those problems, but it is not. To increase the amount of the roads and highways, some space will be needed. However, the big cities have already too much roads and buildings to make more roads and highways. Building more roads in these cities should contain destruction of buildings or expanding the city, and this makes just more complicated city and traffic jam. On the other hand, improving public transportation does not need any expansion. Thus, more effective and economical.
To summarize, governments should spend money on improving public transport. Three reasons are given for this, even if some says roads and highways are more important. Improving public transport is necessary in terms of population, traffic, and spacing, and this will improve the city life, too."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

In today's turbulent society, it is difficult for us to determine the best way to help the world. One of the ways is to improve the quality of transportation. In my opinion, spending more money on improving public transportation is more important than roads and highways.
To begin with, environmental problems are a more urgent concern than developing the roads. People are indeed living in a society where environmental pollution is getting more serious. As pollution is growing fast, the number of cars is exponentially increasing as well followed by an increase in methane gas from them. Car exhaust gas causes air pollution, and it is rising as a critical problem today. To resolve this problem governments should slightly improve public transportation to encourage people to save the world and address the seriousness of air pollution.
Secondly, it is possible for economic growth to be active. When public transportation is more activated, economic benefits are increased not only for individuals but also for the nation. In the case of public transportation, some of the profits are included as taxes used by the public in the transportation sector, so the more it is used, the more improvement it will make in the transportation sector. Moreover, public transportation costs little. For example, the maintenance fee for things such as engine replacement, fuel charging, tire replacement is high compared to public transportation prices. Thus, it is better to improve public transportation.
Some people argue that improving roads and highways can have a greater effect on traffic jams than improving public transportation, and it will cost less in the long run. However, traffic congestion in crowded places is not solved in the first place because of the high density of the roads in Korea. Besides, there is no more room for road expansion in this high-density country. Since Korea is already developed as much it could, it is better to develop public transportation to increase efficiency on existing roads than to expand roads.
In conclusion,  the government should spend money on improving public transportation rather than road and highways. It helps boost the economy as it consumes money in the transportation market and better for our environment."	5	5	4.5	14.5

Until now, in Korea, many citizens use advanced public transportation anytime. Although many think that using public transportation is quite uncomfortable to transfer and physically hard, it has many individual and public advantages. In my opinion, governments should spend more money on improving public transportation for three reasons in different aspects: convenience, environment, and cost.
Nowadays, public transportation is widely used for a long distance like Seoul to Pusan. In this case, using public transportation is more convenient than cars, because people don’t need to concentrate on their driving and ride comfort is not bad. For example, some college students like KAIST students use trains a lot to go dormitory. If parents drive Seoul to Daejeon with their car, parents will get tired after their driving. Rather than using a car, if students use express bus or train, they can save a time and feel more comfortable. 
Second, public transportation is more eco-friendly than cars. If all citizens use their individual cars every day, a lot of carbon dioxide occurs in the air. This carbon dioxide would cause green gases which increase the temperature globally. However, if all of them use subways at once, it could save the clean air from air pollution. Furthermore, some transportations work by electric energy, so they don’t release any polluted gas. 
On the other hand, some argue that the public transportation is quite expensive. However, there are lots of events to discount the transportation expenses; for example, traveling with four friends in KTX can halve the KTX fee. Not only the transportations with a long distance, but also subways have some great discount system in Korea. If the user transfers to another subway track, it just cost a little additional pay to travel a long distance. Plus, car also pays a lot of money on oil charging, so using car is not much economically beneficial than public transportation.
In conclusion, spend more money on public transportation is much more beneficial than roads and highways. Some argue that it is financial damage, but its convenience, environmentally positive effect, and discount of cost cover all disadvantages with additional benefits. There will be more advanced public transportations created that many enjoy them to get in workplace or travel."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

Nowadays, transportation is important since most people live in cities that need vehicle to move far. Therefore, governments from various countries concern about spending money to improve roads and highways, or public transportation. In my opinion, improving public transportation is better than improving roads and highways for several reasons.
First of all, improving public transportation is more environmental-friendly. Improving roads and highways would increase personal car drivers, which is one of the causes of pollution; on the other hand, improving public vehicles would make people to choose them rather than their own cars. To maintain clean environments with convenience, spending money to improve public transportation is the best way.
Second, improving public transportation costs less than improving roads and highways. To improve roads and highways, the government need to find out less efficient roads, destroy them, and make new one; however, to improve public transportation, they just need to increase the number of them, or change the line of them. It need far less money and time for latter one, which means more economical.
Some people may think that improving roads and highways would give more conveniences than public vehicles; although it would make people with their own cars more convenient at first, improving roads and highways would give people more traffics on the roads. According to research from KAIST, there was more accidents and traffic problems with wide roads(Jeon 32). On the other hand, lots of public transportation would distribute car drivers to them, and it will decrease traffic problems.
To sum up, improving public transportation is more environmental-friendly, costs less, and gives more conveniences while going out. Since the governments should choose better one in the limited budget, improving public transportation would be the best choice for their citizens."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

"	"Various kinds of transporting facilities are helping our live: including facilities for a car, such as roads and highways, and a public transportation. Both transportations help our live in different way. However, if the government budget is limited, in my opinion, an investment in public transportation should be preceded. There are three reasons why government should spend money on improving the public transportation; reduce of transport congestion, less destruction of environment, and reduce of environmental pollution.
First of all, developing a public transportation reduces transport congestion. According to Kim, who researches about Korean transportation and transport congestion, using bus and underground reduces transport congestion more than 25%. We should consider the fact that the population density is exponentially increasing(Anderson), and capacitance of people in public transportation is much better than a car(Kim). Indeed, Following the researches about transportation and population, we can easily think that public transportation is better way in reducing transport congestion in high population density.
Second, developing public transportation makes less destruction of environment. Korea has a lot of mountains and the land is usually not flat enough to make highway(Lee). Therefore, environment such as mountains are easily destroyed to construct highways and road. In contrast, developing public transportation usually happens inside or near the city, so it derives to less destruction of environment. Accordingly, the animals live in that environment could be safer, too.
Apart from the advantages related with transportation, improving public transportation is better in protecting environment. Public transportation uses less energy than a car, and also emits less pollution maters than a car. If we consider the future transportation with less pollution, we should invest in public transportation than other ones.
To sum up, despite the convenience of a road and highways, we should develop a public transportation. It will be the way to reduce pollution, environment destruction, and also the congestion. At the end, the government should invest in public transpotation.

Including floating population, the amount will be much more.  Since cities these days have a large population and complicated structures, well-constructed traffic systems are highly required. There can be many ways to improve traffic systems. Some people argue that governments should spend more money on improving roads and highways; however, in my opinion, governments should spend more money on improving public transportation.
First of all, expanding public transportation is far more effective in improving traffic systems. Nowadays, a number of people prefer public transportation since they cannot afford to buy a car or owning car is not suitable for their purpose. For this reason, enhancing public transit brings great effect if it is fully settled down. 
In addition, constructing public transportation is good for the environment. Buses, trains, and subways can pick up a lot of people at once; therefore, they use less fuel if they are established successfully. Furthermore, environmentally friendly vehicles such as electric motor vehicle can be used for public transportation if promoted by cities. Since cities should pursue sustainable development, public transportation must be improved more.
Others argue that roads and highways should be expanded since there are still numerous traffic jams. However, in fact, increasing roads and highways does no help for relieving traffic jams. Traffic jams come from complicated structures and large floating population. Adding more roads and highways will bring negative feedback in traffic jams since it will yield more cars and more floating population. Thus, expanding public transportation is far more appropriate for relieving traffic jams than expanding roads and highways.
To sum up, since public transportation is effectual in enhancing traffic systems and eco-friendly, governments should spend more money on improving it. Expanding public transportation will bring better lives for numerous people."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

When people have a company or school which is located in a long distance, they use cars or public transportation to commute to and from school. Moreover, transportations are necessary to go on a trip or far places to go. Current transportation has many problems, so it is vital to invest in both on roads and highways or public transportation. In my opinion, spending more money on improving roads and highways are needed for three main reasons.
First of all, people drive more cars than public transportation. Investing more money in more people's choice is natural. Besides, many people buy and use cars because they know that public transportation is quite uncomfortable. For example, public transportation has so few seats that it is inconvenient to ride standing up.
In addition to more people drive cars, current situations on the roads and highways are awful. When traffic accident, all the cars in the back are congested. In other words, if these things happen on the way to and from work, there will be a catastrophe in which everyone is late. On the other hand, public transportation comes on time and goes along the set road, so there is no traffic accident, and there is much less risk of accidents. For example, in the case of subways, there is no risk of traffic jams, and buses also have designated bus lanes.
Some argue that investing more in public transportation would be more economical because many people would use it. Only a few years ago this was true; however, considering the current public transportation system, there are so many people that it is very cramped inside. The more people using it, the longer time needed to wait for boarding on it.
To sum up, it is desirable to invest more in roads and highways by the above grounds. More people are using cars rather than public transportations; furthermore, more improvements are needed for the roads and highways. Although it is said that public transportations are more economical, there is no space to afford more people. As people should move longer distance, investing in both cars and public transportation are right thing, but spending more in cars are needed for the current circumstances."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

Do you know how many cities have subway lines in Korea exclude kyung-gi province? Only 5 cities have subways lines in Korea. It is not reasonable for Korea's traffic characteristics to have weak public transportation. Some people think that Korea need more roads and highways; however, in my opinion, the government should spend more money on improving public transportation especially for trains and subways.
First, increasing more roads in cities of Korea only makes cities more complicated. Korea has very small land and intensive population in specific cities. Therefore, when goverment build more roads and highways in that cities, small cities will be more massive to move. 
Second, to solve the environment pollution problem, government should spend more money on public transportation. Spending money to improve roads and highways means the government encourages people to use their own cars. USing more car has negative effect on nvironment; for example, using more car caues atmosphere pollution and metal trash on ocean. To prevent these pollution, government should spend more money on public transportation.
Some argue that roads and highways are needed more because of transport business. However, increasing of trains can handle this problem.Transport industry can be maintained with trains;moreover, transport will be faster when using trains.
To sum up, three reasons to spend money on improving public transportation exist. First, increaing subway lines makes intensive population move faster. Second, using public transporatation prevents environmental pollution. Lastly, using train has positive effects on transport industry.

Nowadays, government still spends a lot of money on these systems, but there is some debate that which system should be more improved. Some people argue that government should spend more money on improving roads and highways, and some argue that government should spend more money on improving public transportation system. Although there are many debates about which system should be more developed, my opinion is that public transportation system should be more developed.
First of all, public transportation system is necessary for lots of people. People who do not have personal cars, such as teenagers and disabled people, must have to use public transportation systems. By considering equality, government should spend more money to develop public transportation for these people.
Another reason that public transportation should be developed is the efficiency. in general, public transportation system is more efficient than personal cars or other transportation systems. Moreover, it is easy to develop the public transportation system.
On the other hand, some people argue that roads and highways should be developed more because roads and highways are important for people who have personal cars. However, too much personal cars cause a lot of problems. For instance, smoke from personal cars is the main reason of air pollution. In addition, personal cars need parking space for each vehicle. But in Korea, these parking spaces are not efficient because the territory of Korea is small. Therefore, by considering these reasons, public transportation system should be more developed than roads and highways for personal cars.
To sum up, since public transportation is necessary for many people and more efficient, government should spend more money in the public transportation system. I hope that someday, I can see more developed and more convenient public transportation system."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

Some people feel that the roads and highways should be improved; however, others feel that there should be more public transportation. In my opinion, governments have to spend more money on improving roads and highways. There are several reasons why road development is a priority.
First of all, there are many roads which have to be improved. For example, at the country, some roads are too narrow that two cars can barely pass by. In addition, some roads are too bumpy; therefore, they can damage to cars. Also, some highways are old and damaged. They need to be check and repaired to prevent accidents.
In addition to some old roads, some other roads are difficult to pass due to heavy traffic. The main streets of the big city are heavily congested with traffic for an hour at the rush hour. If the roads are expanded or new roads are built, this problem will be solved. Moreover, the situation on the highway is more serious during the national holidays. Since many people drive to their hometowns, highways should be more developed.
Some argue that more public transportation is needed. That is true, but the roads should be ready before that. If there are more buses on the current roads, it will be more inefficient and slower than the original. Also, some people do not use public transportation, but there is no one who does not use the roads; therefore, the development of roads should be prioritized. The development of public transportation is possible only when roads are wide and more.
To sum up, the government should pay more attention to the development of roads and highways. For this reason, the first is that many roads are now old and require maintenance, and secondly, some roads are complicated. The development of roads is very necessary for people to pass more comfortably and smoothly."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

"Computer technology changed the world. Even though computer technology is one of the greatest innovation in the history, some say that it is not important than basic needs. In my opinion, governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology for various reasons.
First of all, computer technology itself is one of the basic needs in modern society. For instance, video meetings and classes are inevitable right now due to COVID-19, and one of most popular identification method is checking one's mobile phone number. On the other hand, a laptop, a smartphone or paying internet bill is quite expensive especially for low-income families. Government should invest on computer technology, including providing basic computational electronics for poor people.
In addition to basic needs, various occupations are made thanks to computer technology development. Recently, getting a job is very hard to achieve; it is a big social problem that government should solve. Developing computer technology is one of the best choice to make new occupations without destroying environments.
Some argue that developing computer technology over other countries is waste of money. According to their opinion, it is enough to catch up recent computer technology in leading countries to use modern advantages. However, investing on computer technology has big potential in the future. For example,  South Korea government had invested significant budget on fast internet during 2000s. As a result, South Korea is not only strong on computer technology, but also strong in cultural impact thanks to quicker exchange of information.

First of all, developing computer technology can make future lives more convenient. Nowadays, autonomous electronics are developing in many countries, since they are more convenient in several parts. For example, many companies are developing the autonomous vehicles, and other companies are developing smart television or robot that can help our living. Computer technology is strongly needed on these autonomous electronics; since autonomous electronics are moving by computer codes. As a result, spending money on computer technology have high probability to make future lives more convenient.
Next, South Korea's strength on international trade market is computer technology. Companies like Samsung or LG are in the first group of the electronics, which computer technology is strongly needed. If government does not spend money to computer technology, Samsung or LG can lose their power in the market. That can cause the weakness of the South Korea on international trade market.
Some arguments say that country can be more stable and stronger when its basic needs are enough. On the other hand, developing computer technology can make power in international market. Then country can get more money by selling computer technology; as a result, country can spend money on basic needs. This cycle will make country more stronger and economically better.
To sum up, government should spend money on developing computer technology for several reasons: making future lives more convenient, keeping strength on electronics market, making better cycle on the money in country. Spending money on computer technology cannot affect to people's lives instantly. However, people can live better in the future."	4.5	4	4.5	13

"Government Budget Should Be Spent On Basic Areas

Deciding how government should spend their budget is a difficult problem. There are several areas that need government budget, and the government have to divide the money properly. Nowadays, computer technology is considered to be quite important, so some people argue that government should spend much money in this area. On the other hand, others say that there are more basic areas which needs the money. In my opinion, there are several areas other than computer technology which government budget should be spent. 
First of all, there are people who do not have their basic life quality; that is, there are people who do not have enough money to eat, wear, or live in a house. They are in too bad circumstances and needs some help of the government. The government should help them live a better life. 
Additionally, also in the view of technology, the government should spend more money for basic science and mathematics. Many people who are talented in science choose engineering as their major rather than basic science because the money. The budget that is spent on basic science is too less; therefore, people are reluctant to major in basic science. However, basic science is literally the base of all the engineering field. It is very important to improve the quality of basic science in our country. That is the reason why government should spend their budget on the basic science instead of computer technology.
Some people may say, computer technology is developing fast and the government should follow the pace of development. However, the importance of catching up the computer technology is overestimated. Government can concentrate on improving basic science such as theoretical physics or mathematics and slowly improve the computer technology. 
To sum up, government budget should be used to help poor people and develop natural sciences. Computer technology is not an urgent problem. If the government uses the budget in more basic areas, the country will be better."	4.5	4.5	4	13

"From the invention, computer has been developed extremely fast until nowadays. Computer in present, it can do almost all tasks more and fast than humans. Furthermore, COVID-19 situation makes people to require more computer technology than before since they have restriction for outside works. Indeed, spent more and more money on computer technology will result neglectful investment to basic needs, which is also important to people. However, it is not much important than shortage of technology. Therefore, governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology.
Most of all, governments should consider how to spend their money most efficiently. Computer technology is the most efficient way to use national treasury since computer technology itself is efficient. There are lots of work that is simple iteration and calculation, but done by humans; computer can replace those tasks more fast without wage. Therefore it is economical and efficient. 
Not only efficiency, computer technology is also future-oriented. Computer is existing everywhere such as refrigerator, television, and washing machine. Consequently, as in future, computer technology will occupy more position on technology market. Governments should prepare those situations by invest and developing computer technology. For example, in near future, machine learning technology can replace jobs that humans only can done such as delicate jobs or recognition tasks.
Some argues that governments should invest their money to basic need first, because it is exactly what people really requires. Although basic need is essential to people, computer technology can produce basic need more faster than spent govern money to it. Moreover, basic need can be made in factories, which is best to perform computer technology's efficiency because factory is full of simple iteration and calculation. Fully automated factories with high-tech computer technology can produce enough basic needs to people.
To sum up, computer technology is efficient and future-oriented. Governments has duty to consider how to use their money efficiently, and think about their future. Therefore, computer technology should be their most important part to spend their state coffers."	4.5	4.5	4	13

"Computer Technology Is Most Important to Development

Science and engineering are most important part of nowadays. Korea governments spend money to develop them for strength of nations. Science and engineering include a lot of majors, and computer technology is one of them; moreover, it spread the width of the scholar faster, so it is connected other study closely. Connections of computer technology and others make it important. In my opinion, the government should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying that because computer technology is most important part.
First of all, computer technology is core part of making nations safety. For example, there are too much technology about using or control weapons with computers like using super computer for find and remove enemy's airplanes. Developed Computer technology is basic of them; moreover, that technology makes weapons to protect more stronger. It is important especially for Korea because of awareness of war.
In addition to the first reason, computer technology contribute making newest industry. For example, after invention of internet, many industry that use the internet appear; furthermore, they hire a lot of people and make huge markets never be appeared before. That situation makes economy bigger and faster; therefore, people get lots of benefit for internet, a kind of computer technology.
Some argue that basic science should be grown by governments more because it makes basis of other engineering. However, developed computer engineering contribute to study basic science also. For instance, in dry chemistry labs, they use complicated computer modeling to find some model about interaction between atoms or other materials. That study needs highest developed computer program. Other basic sciences like biology, physics, and mathematics also need computer technology for modeling, simulation, and proof study.
To sum up, there are some reasons that governments should develop or buying computer technology; to protect, to make a new industry, to develop basic sciences. Nowadays, the government show movements that reduce spending money for science, include computer technology. Even if the government has not a vary money, it should be spend money for computer technology not only development of computer science but also development of Korea."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

"As computer technology is the heart of high technology, computer technology is the foundation of national development. Despite the claim, some people think governments should spend money on more basic needs. In my opinion, governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology.
First of all, almost high technologies are based on computer technology. To develop high technologies that determine the future of the nation, developing computer technology is necessary.  By developing computer technology, the nation can go ahead of other counties. 
In addition to developing high technologies, computer technology can give opportunities to lower-income groups. In the case of computer technology, anyone who has a computer can use it. If governments support computers, then lower-income groups can have opportunities to use high technology.
Finally, some people believe that computer technology removes many jobs, computer technology creates various businesses and jobs. For example, most of the largest companies are based on computer technology and they provide really many jobs. Also, many businesses are created by computer technology.
To sum up, developing or buying computer technology develops high technology, gives opportunities to lower-income groups, and creates various businesses and jobs. For national development, governments spend money on computer technology should be mandatory."	4	4	4.5	12.5

Although some believe that governments should spend as much money as possible on basic needs, others suggest that governments need to spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. In my opinion, spending money on computer technology is needed.
First of all, computer technology makes productivity increase. If the government makes new systems by computers, productivity can increase by saving time.
In addition to the activation of productivity, computer technology makes governments powerful. Today, technology of governments means competitiveness. If they have the technology, you will bring a lot of money to their country by participating in other countries' businesses.
Finally, some argue that computer makes people lose jobs. However, the computer actually increases people who have jobs. The development of computer technology activates the economy. As governments focus on computer technology, many companies will participate in developing computer technology. Developments of computer technology not only make a lot of profits but also increase employees, which leads to the activation of the economy.
To sum up, focusing on computer technology should be mandatory."	4	4	4.5	12.5

"Nowadays, the importance of computer science is increasing rapidly since enterprises demands automation on workplaces. Not only companies, ordinary people also realize how computer is convinent and important on various area. Justly, computer science became a trend on scientific approach method. Enhancing computer science is one of competition events between nations, thus it is inevitable to spend money on computer technology. There are several reasons why goverments should invest considerable money on computer technology field: diversification of computer language, dominance of future quantum computers and its connection with other fields. 
Despite importance of computer technology, computer langauage is still complicated. To be familiar with computer, they must learn about computer languages and, by extension, to enhance computer technology, they should easily try on computer language. Portion of computer language developers devote to vary computer language to make more easy and intuitive. Goverments should invest developing easier computer langauge and construct big data using collective intelligence. Furthermore, investing on artificial intelligence which use the big data is also needed.  
Meanwhile, new computer science field, quantum computing, become popular topic. Most of physicists, computer scientists forecast that quantum computing will lead scientific community in the fourth industrial revolution era with its distictly fast computing speed. Goverments must invest on quantum computing field to prepare on next generation. 
Some claim that spending money on computer technology is less important than investing natural scientific fields; however, recent natural scientific fields have derivative field called, computational sicence. They simulate various natural situations, and because they requires huge amount of arithmetic operations, up-to-date CPU is essential. Enhancing computer technology is directly connected with enhancing natural science.

"In modern society, many governments in countries are struggling with where to spend money. Since the money is finite, the topic of how much to distribute it is inevitable, so it is also sensitive but important. In my opinion, the money should be spent on more basic needs, rather than on developing or buying computer technology, for some reasons.
First of all, a field that often referred to as pure academic is the preceding stage of practical academic. When the investments for basic fields are fulfilled, the country will have potential to more develop on these fields; furthermore, they have greater potential even on the actual field. That is, it is no exaggeration to say that many theories on actual came from basics. For example, mathematics and physics are the most basic disciplines in electronic or mechanical studies.
In addition, it is because they are not at the same level as salaries or research support costs for people in the practical. Even in South Korea, investment in engineering colleges with outstanding results is sufficient. On the contrary, there is a shortage of personnel due to the lack of labor and support costs in pure science.
Some may think that it uncertain to invest much to basic fields. However, there will be no future for the country if the government pays attention to the visible investment.
In conclusion, there is a need to invest in pure scholarship as much as or more than the cost of practical studies. Many may have felt that applying without the basics unsettled is not correct."	4	4.5	4.5	13

"After the development of ENIAC, world's first computer, over 50 years had past. Since then, computer technology became currently most important technology in civilization of twenty-first century. In order to follow the trend, many governments are investing great amount of money for research and development of these technologies. However, there are some groups disagreeing to this modern flow and suggest that nations should use budget instead for basic needs too. Despite these argues, governments must spend as much money as possible for computer technology for few reasons.
First of all, computer technology brings great amount of rich for country. As smartphone is invented, mankind can now access to internet and computer anywhere anytime, and almost every industries need computer to develop and create products. Moreover, due to changes called 'fourth industrial revolution', factories started to be operated by computers, and cars started to drive by itself. If government successfully support company to lead this flow, it is sure thing that the nation will achieve greatest wealth of the world. 
Also, IT technology are not effected to nation's environmental condition. While manufacturing industries such as oil companies require certain resources, computer industries are not. In addition, biggest benefit of IT technology is that companies can earn great amount of money with less amount of employees; therefore, even countries with small population can be wealthy. Being too hot or too cold is not a matter too. No matter how weather is, computer industry can be developed if only internet is connected; thanks to amazon's AWS service, server computer with large size isn't required too. IT industry is literally open for anyone and any country.
Even though there exists argument that using these money for poor and reducing rich-poverty gap will help citizens live better life, it is not true, and computer technology will be more beneficial for people. Using tax for social welfare is never a bad thing, but taking those efforts from investment for future is bad thing. Computer technology can increase nation's GDP, and it leads to increase of income for every citizens. Therefore, without spending more account for social welfare, quality of life can be increased for everyone.
Thanks to internet and computer, people are able to enjoy their life and hobby even during pandemic quarantine. Computer technologies still have great unforeseen future, and size of market is constantly increasing for over 20 years. They have limitation for neither resource nor environment, and provides tremendous amount of wealth. In conclusion, investing as much as government can to the industry will be the best choice."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

"As the modern technology has developed from 20th century, the importance of computer technology also has been increased. Some assure that computer technology is the most important one in modern engineering field. Even some claim that government should spend as much money as possible for it. However, the government should not spend a lot for computer technology for three reasons.
First of all, there are lots of basic science fields which must be developed; for example, physics and chemistry. Those fields need more budget, and people who have studied in the basic science fields have claimed that the government should spend more money on basic science. According to the statistics from OECD, the investment of the Korean government for the basic science is 56th out of 150 conturies. Considering that Korea is an advanced contury, that result is too nonsense. Even the basic sciences are the necessary ones for developing computer technology. Instead of spending much money only for computer science, making investment to the basic science would show much better results.
In addition to the investment for basic sciences, securing a budgeet for welfare also necessary. Recently, the gap between rich and poor is more and more increasing. It is not the only welfare problem and there exist too many problem in Korean society such as the price of real estimate, education fee, and employment difficulties.
Some argue that developing computer science would make much more money than ever before. However, our contury, Korea, has mainly made profits by selling semiconductor chips for smartphones, cars, and ships to other conturies. The computer is not the main soure of trade profit. Also, even if the government tries to develop computer science, it would be difficult to profit because there already exist too strong computer enterprises like Intel, Microsoft, and Google. 
To sum up, the government should not spend a lot for computer technology. The reasons are simple. Our contury, Korea, necessarily need more budget for basic sciences and welfare. Ultimately, it is too difficult to make money with computer technology since that filed already became a red ocean a few decades before. What it means is that it is time to consider and solve the basic needs."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

"In modern society, the scale of the computer technology has been constantly increased, and the scale of investment on it also increased. Because of the large scale of investment, governments are now spending money on computer technology, as a part of the national policy; however, some argue that the money should be spent on more basic needs, such as infrastructure, and public welfare. In my opinion, developing computer technology is more important in several reasons.
First, development of computer technology can increase efficiency of the entire society. Nowadays, most parts of the society has been automated and mechanized. Moreover, computer technology are used to control those processes; therefore, with better computer technology, the society can not only reduce unnecessary steps, but also create new methods on task. 
In addition to efficiency improvement, development of computer technology enables new idea to become true. For example, in past, the idea about artificial intelligence was story of scientific fantasy; but, it became true in the modern society, by development of computer technology.
Although some claim that development of computer technology will take away human jobs, it rather creates new innovative jobs in the society. It is true that some jobs that require simple work will replaced my machine, however there are new jobs that use computer technology like computer engineer, robot scientist, and many other jobs.

"Investments in Computer Technology is Not the Only Thing to Care About.

As technology is getting more important these days, people's interest is gathering in developing technologies. Especially, computer technology is taking a large part in the electronics industry and necessary for our daily life; however, it does not mean that governments should use all the money in computer technology. There should be investments in other areas such as food, houses, and education for several reasons.
First of all, there is no reason for computers when people do not know how to use it. People who are old or living in a poor village did not have chances to use recent electronic devices; therefore, even if governments bought and gave computers to these people, they would not know how to use it. Education should proceed before handing out computers.
In addition to the need for education, computers are not everything in our life. Food, clothing, and shelter are the basics of life which is the most important thing in life that needs to be achieved first. There are lots of people who do not have something to eat or somewhere to live. Governments should primarily use the money for the ones that lack basic needs.
Some say advances in technology is directly connected to improvement in the quality of life, but advances in technology will only make the rich's life better. Those who have the money to buy the result of developed technology will earn more money while the poor suffer from a lack of technology which will result in polarization of wealth.
To sum up, trying to spend money as much as possible on the computer will only result in the polarization of the wealth and pain of the poor. Governments should not only use money in computer technology but use the money to make people's quailty of life better."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

167	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"I think more than one major is better than just one major. For example, in KAIST, do a multiple major is one of thing to graduate. Of course, do a one major more specialized is one option, but most students in KAIST is doing multiple major because that is more helpful for the future. I also think varied subject is better. In 21st century, you have to live much longer, maybe 100 years, so you can't do just one jobs. So learning many subject is needed. Also, differently contrast to the past, many subject is going to mixed and got complex. So just one specific major is not that helpful to work. Many fields is created and will be created, so knowing about many subject is more helpful to adjust in new mixed fields. For example, many universities is forcing students to got minor subject, and lots of universities is recommending to got double major because one major is not helpful to raise people more adaptive in social. Also, do a one subject deeply is not for most students. For people that want to be a scholar is needed to learn deep study, but most people will not be a scholar. They will be a person work in more realistic ground, and that doesn't require deep information and knowledge. Realistic field need flexible thought, so if person know about varied subjects, that will help more than a person that know one subject. So knowing about many subject is recommended from social, company and country. For example, lots of group like company is needed to survive, so adaptive is more needed than scholar knowledge. "	3.5	3	2.5	9

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	" What is your major? Commonly, most of the students in university have their own major. On the other hand, some universities require their students to study various subjects. Through this point, students may be expert other than their major. However, I think that this kind of strategy may harm students' knowledge. I insist that universities must require students to specialize in their own major. I can give you three reasons.
 First of all, taking classes other than their major consumes time to study their own major. According to my experience, my major is computer science. I take two or three classes about my major for each semester. However, I also take one or two classes about art or religion, because KAIST require students to study these parts for graduation. In the week for preparing exam, I need to study art or religion in the time that I planned for studying my major. Every semester, It feels like burden to me.
 Next, students must be expert in their major. Ideally, if the students take classes in many subjects, they can be expert in various areas. However, the time is limited, so students cannot take sufficient classes for each subject. When they graduate, students may not know sufficiently about every subject they studied in university. I think that 4 years in university is not long enough for studying only one subject. For instance, there are students that graduate university for 5 or 6 years. It means that even for one subject, 4 years may not be sufficient.
 Last, studying other subject must be selective. There can be students who want to study classes in many subjects. In KAIST, students can enroll in most of the class regardless of their own major. For instance, you can enroll in data structure class even if your major is life science. Furthermore, if you meet specific standard, you can have dual degree that shows you are expert in another subject, too. You must be expert in your major first, and looking for other classes must be not prior to your major.
 To sum up, universities must require students to specialize in one subject. There are three reasons to support my idea. Taking other class with their major need much time. Also, students may not be major in various subjects and studying many subjects must not be forced. I'm also undergraduate student in KAIST. I think that I must be expert in my major first, and other classes must be followed by major. "	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
169	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Taking classes in many subjects would be more proper. Let's suppose if I have to specialize in one subject, here in KAIST. At first, it'll be seem as I became somewhat professional in my subject. But as soon as I graduate the school, I'll probably find out myself premature man in other subject. Whatever I do after graduation, a job that requires only single profession in particular subject won't exist. Society's needs are getting more and more complicated, and that's why some simple knowledge outside one's field, at least, is important.
Even though I'm in the field of science, studying about humanism is important. It is impossible to do a research without having own philosophy and direction of mind related to research. And of course, there is no researcher only researching in one's life. To fight with problems I encountered during my life, I have to learn the strategies to fight, which is called humanism.
Someone can say that still there is a job that needs only one kind of specialization. But as I said, every kind of job demands more and more complicated abilities these days. The job which needs only one kind of specialization will soon disappear. If that happens, and I don't get any preparation, I'll eventually have to learn from other subjects. So why can it be bad to study early?
Here's my conclusion. Students have to satisfy complicated needs of society and fight out with their private problems in their future. To do so, it is essential to get an acknowledgement in other subjects. Requirement of some universities making students to take classes in many subjects is clearly reasonable policy."	3.5	3	3	9.5
170	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	" Nowadays, many things around us such as technology, global society, food, goods are improved with mixed knowledge, culture, field. The combination is very important factor in many areas.
Our school, KAIST also require students to classes in many subjects through the rule of 4track. It is the rule that all of KAIST students should have more than one major with main major and another major. If students want have more major, KAIST support the willing of students. While studying in KAIST for 1years, I felt many merit for the 4track rule. So, I think that universities require students to take classes in many subjects is good for students based on my experience. There are two reasons for my opinion.
 First, we can make innovative ideas, technology that we haven't seen before by mixing the knowledge in many kinds of field. 
 The second reasons is that we can reflect many opinions of many people by applying various experience, knowledge when we make somethings such as goods, rule. People have each different require, need, favorite. If we want reflect all these needs we should know about the knowledge related these needs. 
 Of course, We should try to take classes in many subjects with our specialized main major made my owns then we can make great achievement. "	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
171	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	" Taking classes in many subject and specializing in single subject are both great options. However, if I really had to make a choice between two options, I would prefer the latter, which is taking classes in specialized single subject. There are three reasons for this idea.
 First of all, classes in specialized one subject is helpful for students' career. In many cases, jobs usually require deep knowledge, not wide knowledge. For instance, even if doctor knows wide range of knowledge, doctor without deep knowledge of biology and medical skills cannot be a good doctor. Maybe someone said that wide range of knowledge can help us sometimes, but we should remember that deep knowledge, not wide knowledge is base for every jobs. Of course, universities' education that based on one specialized subject will help students build base for future career.
 In addition to this, make student to take classes in many subject can be detrimental. If student have to take classes in many subject, he should take not only classes in subject that he likes to learn, but also classes in subject that he dislikes to learn. Forcing student to take classes in subject that he dislike can make student to lose his passion for learning new things. In worst case, losing passion for learning new things can caused to passion for his major too. As we can see from this example, make students to specialize in one subject could be better option.
 Finally, learn deeply in one subject can offer power to challenge other subjects. Personally, in my case, I can learn different computer language such as C and Java well after I learn much about python, which is programming language that easier to learn. As example shows, deep knowledge in one specific area can help to understand other topics in different area too. Also, It can give us passion to challenge new topics in different major. So, I think that specializing in one subject is the first step for student to learn things in many subjects.
 For these reasons, I think that specializing in one subject is much better than take classes in many subjects."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
172	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	" I think students should be encouraged to participate in many kinds of subjects. 
Specializing in one subject is not appropriate to the undergraduates who doesn't even know many other types of studies, and what will fit to them.
Also that kind of policies, forcing students on only one subject can be very stressful.
 For example, lets say that you are 2nd grade undergraduate student of EE.
You are feeling extreme stress nowadays about the subject you are in, finally finds out that EE does not basically fits with you in any aspects.
Now in this situation if you have basic information about many other department of studies, thanks to the policy, the process of searching for another major will be more easy and reasonable.
 Students who wants double major, or minor major can also get help.
Recently, literally 'nothing' can be done with a single kind of knowledge, which is the reason why educational experts prefer fusion-educations or such things.
So it will be more important to have various kinds of knowledge through double major or minor.
Similarly to the first case it is clear that students who have basic information about many other department will have advantage. "	2.5	1.5	3	7
173	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"  Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. On the other hand, other universities require students to specialize in one subject. In my opinion, I agree with the first case based on two reasons. First, there are many restricts to produce new creative things with only one subject these days. Second, even in the university, there should be chances for student to search for their real dreams.
  First of all, a person who have specialized in one specific subject is likely to be lack of a wide competence. I am currently double majoring in Computer science and Industrial design. Many courses of the department of the Industrial design for the students in more than third year requires the ability to make a computer program, being able to embedded in the product. In other words, there are lots of assignment or projects requiring not only designing the products that looks beautiful but also giving special functions to them. For example, some students majoring in Industrial design produces a color-changing lamp that recognizes the color of marbles which the user put into the lamp or a music player that plays love songs when the user draw a heart shape or songs related with rain when the user draw a rain drop shape on the player. Many students in the department of industrial design now choose Computer science of Electrical Engineering as their double major or minor, since it allows them to show more powerful performances with various knowledge.
  Furthermore, since students are still learners, not workers yet, they have to experience different fields that they have not done before. In Korea, students should choose their future job to go to an university usually when they just became a high school student. They have to focus on only one field and look for the very subject so that there are something they can show to the universities. One of my friends in KAIST is now majoring in Electrical engineering although his wanted-subject was Machine engineering when he was a freshman, and another friend, also in KAIST, is now majoring in Industrial design even though her first wanted-subject was Biological science. As anybody can see, since it is too early to choose only one subject that they have to specialize forever for 17-year-old high school students or 20-year-old freshmen, universities have to give more opportunity for students to search for many other subjects.
  In conclusion, I strongly agree with the statement that universities requiring students to take class in many subject is better than other universities requiring students to specialize in one subject. Firstly, students can achieve wide view throughout various subjects, which can be applied to their future works usefully. Moreover, since most of students who are only 20 or 21 years old are too young to find the thing that they really want to be, universities have to be the places for students to spread their wings by letting them experience more subjects than they expected. Also for me, taking classes in many subjects in KAIST have been a pretty helpful experience."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
174	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"In many universities, students are required to enroll in classes of various fields, and some other universities do not. Although some may argue that the requirement is mandatory for students' personal growth, the students should not be forced to take classes they do not wish to take, for it is their right to choose the relevant path of growth that they desire.

It is the students themselves not the college administrator that acknowledge thier academic needs which suits thier career path in their onw lives better than anyone else. Therefore, the courses of the most versatile skills might not be relevant to some participants at all. For instance, the course ""General Biology"", which should not be considered ""general"" in any way, is required for the entirerity of KAIST undergraduate students. The course prove to be relevant for some, but definitely not for those who seek pure mathematics degree.

Students should have a glimpse into many field for thier all-around academic development. Nevertheless, they should not be force to enroll or choose to enroll from the limited amount of courses the university provide, as some students may already learned and experienced them already outside of the class, and the time in university may be better spent enhancing skills that are absolutely neccesary.

Finally, some might argue that some course should and must be learnt no matter what the crrer path and thier prior experience. They might be right, but the judgement should be place upon the students themselves. The students are conscious and intelligent beings who can weigh advantages and disadvantages of a course. The college administrator can and should recommend courses to enroll, but the final desicion should be "	4	4	3.5	11.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"My opinion about this topic is that I strongly agree with the universities that require students to take classes in many subjects. I have many reasons to support my opinion. First, Nowadays, global cooperation and comunication is essential. We can't develop nor improve anything without working with each other, since science is too complicated for one person or one lab to handle. So, to communicate, we have to have a common laguage across the world and it is now english. This why we have to learn english in universities. But not only english, other parts of science different from your major are important and this would be my second reason. Like I said above, cooperation is important and when I mean by 'cooperation', it means cooperation between different parts of science too. We could specialize one subject and investigate new theories, but since all parts of science have the same base after all, eventually we have to know all of them or at least some of them to study your major efficiently. Third, a scientist with no moral thoughts is a disaster. A scientist can be a two-sided blade depending on his/her decision and you can realize that this is true through history. So, to be a scientist with right moral thoughts, we have to learn other subjects like reading books, discussion, history and so on. These subjects would help us to be great scientist who helps human race to have a more convienient life. These are my 3 reasons and to conclude, I think it is all about cooperating and comunicating with other people from different country and different interests, and to do this, learning many kinds subjects in university is a very important thing in the present and also in the future."	3	3	4	10
176	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"I think take classes in many subject is better.
First, one subject is related with many other subjects.
So, when we have background knowledge about other subjects, we can get advantage although we wants to learn one specific subject.
Second, we can understand other people's opinion who have different specialized subject more effectively. It will be helpful to work with other peoples.
Third, take classes in many subjects can help people who have not interested in specific subject yet or who wants to change their specialized subject.
Many people said me when we choose subjects that we are not interested in, or subject that are different with our thinking, it is very tired and hard to concentrate in study.
So there are many people who wants to change their specialized subject.
Learning many subjects can gives people experience to find their own interest.
Last, but not least, find and choose subjects that they want to listen can make people learn more effectively.
When people choose subjects they are interested in, they are very actively participate in learning, and who do not have interest yet, they can easily change classes they take, and it helps people find their own interest faster.
From these reasons, I think take classes in many subject is better."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	" In the past, many university require students to specialize in only one subject. Nowadays, many university, for example KAIST and POSTECH, require students to take classes in many subjects. The direction of education change to taking many subjects. In this paper, it talks about that taking many subjects is better than taking one subject. There are three reasons for supporting this opinion.
 First of all, taking many subject gives many chances. You take one subject but, you don't like this subject. If you are taking only one subject, you should do this subject forever. If you are taking many subjects, you can take other subjects then you can choose your best subject. For example, you study circuit theory in this semester but, you don't like it then, you can listen other subject.
 At second, taking many subject makes brain strong. If you study many subjects, you can make your brain strong. For example, you study calculus and electromagnatics. Calculus is helpful for studying electromagnatics so, your brain power can grow up by taking many subject.
 Finally, taking many subject can make new area. For example, electric engineering is born 50 years ago. Electric engineering is mixing of physics and mathmatics. This means if people don't take mathmatics and physics both, electric engineering can't exist. Taking many subject can make new subject and area.
 In conclusion, taking many subjects is better than taking one subject. First reason is taking many subject gives many chances. Second reason is taking many subject makes brain strong. Final reason is taking many subject can make new area. By these reasons, taking many subjects is very important."	3	4	3	10

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"  World have been changed for thousands of years. People in modern society live in complicately connected world. This world impels you to learn various things for live well, like cooking, finance adjusting, handling various kind of machines, and typical high school subjects, etc. But should we have to take classes in many subjects in university than specializing in one subject? For this question, I both agree about two statement, but more strongly agree with specializing.
  First, most important, people cannot be skillful for many areas. Some talented people can be ofcourse, but most people have talent for less than one over two. Requring students to take in many subjects will be wasting of human resources. For the limited human resources, I think it is important to develop specific specialized areas first, and after that we can develop other areas for collaboration or brilliant ideas. Teaching students many subjects will be big loss from view of efficiency.
  Second, it is important to focusing on growth of specialist in this internet society. Internet made our life much easier. We can find various kind of information in the internet with just for one or two clicks. We can contact with very basic knowledge of area, but also with specialized knowlege too. It means people can learn and use almost every kind of knowledge if they want to. So, basic knowledge will be reproduced from many people who are interested in those areas. In other word, teaching basic knowledge in many subjects (for start) will be useless. Importance is in teaching specialized knowledge. We have to focus on making specialists, who will develop quality of knowledge which will make our human life more comfortable. One specialist is much better than many amatuers.
  Last, it gives student much stress. College students have to handle with many situations which is not related to study too. They already have much stress for other things like money, relationships, future. But if we require student to take class in many subjects and evaluated, their stress of study will be raise so far. Because they are not talented for various area, but college say them to get good grade and scores for that areas. It is very stressful for people who have thoughts that they should be good in areas which they're not talented.
  For these three reasons, I agree with specializing in one subject. Ofcourse it is important to learn various subject to become good specialists in the future, but I think studying other areas should be followed by learning specialized knowledge first."	5	4.5	4	13.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are many universities in Korea in spite of small population, and most of those universities are requiring students to take classes in many subjects while some universities require students to specialize in one subject. It is obvious that many advantages exist when learning diverse subjects, such as diverse information of other subjects which helps cooperation with others. However, Universities requiring students to specialize in one subject are better for several reasons.
First,  students can learn more advanced information from professors. Professors can teach students about there upcoming studies if students have enough background knowledge. Most of studies that professors do are very advanced that students cannot comprehend.  However, if school require students to specialize in one subject, the lecture will be helpful for students who are having problem on choosing future career. For example, 
Freshman seminar in KAIST is giving students information about studies in progress now on, but most of freshman cannot comprehend it. It would be more helpful if students are specialized.
Next, students are less stressed from studying subjects which are unfamiliar with. It is clear that a student cannot be good at all the subjects that the university requires. some students will hate mathematics, some will hate biology. This comes as a big stress for students because some subjects are totally different with each other. For example, mathematics and biology have different structures of information. biology gives information with memorizing, but mathematics gives information with usage of basic skills.  
Last, professors can prepare for classes easily. If students take class in diverse subjects, It gives hardness on taking a schedule

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Did you knew that KAIST(Korea Advanced Institution of Science and Technology) requires all kinds of science and math such as biology, chemistry, and linear algebra as a primary courses for freshmen? Not only KAIST, but also many university in Korea used to demand their student to study many subjects as many as they can. According to these examples, I think university that requires their students to take various courses is better than others. Then, why universities that courage students to deal with many subjects are better?
       First of all, world which we are living in has multiple complex problems. Unlike prior world, human kinds are facing difficult issues like global warming or nuclear issues. Theses kind of problems cannot be solved without various perspective and approches. This means that specialist who is only specialized in one subject cannot solve complex problems or misled easily. Thus, it should be better to require students to face various subjects and experience enormous kinds of problem within.
       Moreover, dealing with many subjects can be helpful for improving student's insight. Even if two different subjects are dealing with same problem, each subject's goals and approches has lots of difference. For example, thermodynamics in physics is used to predict how universe will change in the future. But, thermodynamics in chemistry is used to estimate whether this reaction is spontaneous. Eventually, when we study various subjects which taught us many kinds of techniques to solve problems, it will improve our insight toward world.
      In short, studying various courses and subjects can make us live well in world with complex problems and give us brilliant insights. Therefore, university which gives students a oppertunnity to deal with various subjects is better than university which requires students to be specialized."	3.5	4	4	11.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"I think 'efficiency' is the most important thing in study. The efficiency can be maximized when I study with lots of students. So I prefer to study with a group of students for two reasons.

First, I can learn something more when I study with a group of students. For example, there is similar kind of study called 'tutoring'. I did tutoring last year.
In tutoring, I can understand what I didn't know in the lecture. Also, I can ask tutor about difficult part or interesting part. By tutoring, I got a good grade in math.
Also, I can notice which I don't know by discussing with each other. Knowing what I don't know is important in study. I can absorb most part of my learning. 

Second, I won't be lazy. When I study alone in my home, I didn't concentrate on my assignment well. Because there is less stress than study with many people.
So I watched 'youtube' and 'facebook'. However, when I study with a lot of students I have more stress than studying myself. So I can focus my study well.
Also, there is some competence like I want to study more than he or she. Due to these things, I think studying with many students will enhance our efficiency of study.

182	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"I almost prefer to study alone. I will talk about reasons that I like to study alone. First, I can focus on studying for the long time. I can't focus when others do other things except studying. So, I need my own place to study. When I study, I don't prefer to go cafeteria or library. There is so many people in there. I can't focus on my own. Second, I can refresh myself whenever I want. If I play the game or others when I study with my friend, friend can't study well. Surely, It might be a bad thing. It is hard to control time to rest. Also, I can eat lunch or dinner  and finish my studying when I want. I can plan my time very easily. There is many helpful thing when study with a group of students. I prefer to study with a group in a few case. I can ask my question to them when I want. I can have answer easier than studying alone. Also, group can make a homework with my group.  If I don't do homework in a due date, I need to give my money to group. When I study TOEIC that famous English test in Korea , I usually use this way to study English word.  It is very great way to study English to me. If I study English alone, I can't remember English words.  Actually, I don't like to study English. Any other subject like Mathematics or Science, I can study myself well and focus easily. But English, It is very hard to me to focus for the long time. So, I choose way to study with a group.
Finally. I usually prefer to study alone when i study subjects that I can focus easily. But If I can't focus it, I choose way to study with a group. Each way has a good things and bad things. Studying alone, I can focus more easily and control the studying plan like lunch time or break time. Second case, I can take answer of my question easily. If there is homework, I should do it in a due date.

183	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are a lot of controversial idea between study alone and with a group of students. Even in my high school, everyone's style in study is dramatically different. So it is hard to normalize idea about study. But in my case, I used to prefer studying with a group of students. I think study with a group of students is very efficient for learning something in following three reasons.

     First of all, studying with a group of students allows to collaborate with others. When I study, I often conflict to some part that I can not understand easily. If there is any friends who study same part with me, we can share our idea. If I don't know something in textbook, other students in group can help me. In same way, I can help other members. So, it is easy to learn a knowledge in study with a group of students. One more additional advantage is that we can check out misunderstood idea in learning. It means that studying with a group of student contains a process of crosschecking misunderstood concepts.

     Second, studying with a group can trigger creative idea in learning. A few years ago, I visited a IT venture company. I was wonder about the space of company. The reason was that there are a lot of sharing space rather than conventional company building. Even, They doesn't have blind between each seat and easy to communicate. The purpose of that is to make more event of sharing idea between members. They said a lot of creative idea is triggered in communicate with others. This is same to study. I also realize that I can make creative idea in studying with a group of students. A few months ago, I prepared final exam of differential equation with my friends. At that time, we could find a very efficient and creative way to solve differential equation that is not introduced in textbook or professor. Like this cases, we can make creative idea by studying with a group of students.

     Some people argue that it is good to study alone. My parents also emphasized that studying alone makes high efficient in learning. This is related to Korean tradition concept about study. In Joseon dynasty, a lot of scholars go to hidden forest and study with deep-thinking in his own mind. They believe this is the best way to study. This concept about study even affect modern society of Korea. However, I can not agree that old-fashioned idea. Because some brand-new brain-engineering research shows that our memory is related to any other senses; hearing, speaking and conversation. If we study with group of student, we use a lot of senses. Our brain easy to memory the content with our used sense. For example, if you explain something to your friends, our brain can memory much more that just reading same content.

     For these three reasons, I prefer study with a group of students. We can collaborate with others, make creative idea and easily memory something by studying with a group of students. Why not study with your friends? If you studied alone now, just try to study with a group of students. It can be a new paradigm to efficient, creative, easy study."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

First, I can ask questions to other students. If I can't understand some theories, or If there are some problems that I can't solve, then I can ask to others students. If I study alone, then I have to search it by my own. Sometimes, Google can answer for me, but some problems are hard to find in Google too. Also, in this process, friends teach me some skills that are useful in exam too. It makes me to study more easier and get better grade in exam.
Second, I can know better by answering for other students too. By answering questions for friends, I can repeat the components that I studied, so I can remember it better. Also, I can notice what theories I don't know exactly too. So answering questions make me to know better about it. 
Third, other students motivate me to study hard. When I was in high school, my studying's motivation was almost made up by my friends. When I see my friends study hard, I thought ""I have to study hard too"". So I can more concentrate to my study. But not every friends study hard. Some friends want to spend time to play games or having fun rather than studying. So, some friends don't concentrate and talk to me. But, when they do those things, I think ""I am going to do opposite things with them"". In this mind settings, I can study hard with any kind of other students.

 Studying with group have advantages. First, teaching each other make people understand well. You maybe think teaching each other is just good for student who get teaching, but it is not. In my case, I often explain science to my friend. Thanks for this, I can study obviously again, also get other knowledge from my friends. One scientist say, ""If you cannot explain the knowledge for children, you don't know that ,too"" I really agree this sentence.
 Next, There is miss point when you study alone. It is hard to find your mistake yourself. Without other's advise, If you miss something, nobody know your miss point and tell you that. You will know your mistake when you check your exam score. That is too late. With Study group, you cannot undergo this situation.
 Also, group studying improve your willing. Many people become gentle person for themselves. However, someone can see what they do, people do something more. Therefore, study with group make observer who watch what you do. Although you are shy, you can more study.
 To sum up, teaching for others make you study again, your group members find your mistake before exam, and it make observers for making you study. For these reasons, I prefer to study with group of students. Why don't you make your 'studymate'?"	3.5	4	2.5	10

In Korea, study cafe became the new working place. In study cafe, there are some lots of options. There is a room for group meeting, self-studying, and public places with normal tables like library. Like this variances, lots of people have their different preference about studying alone or with a group. In my cases, I prefer to study alone for several reasons.
First, studying alone can makes you concentrate easily. When we study alone, we often find quite place to concentrate. However, if we study with a group of students, we will talk each other to ask some questions, and it can distrupt the concentration. Even if these question is related to our studying, there are some probabilites that we can move on to the unrelated topic.
Next, we don't have to find the group studying place. For group studying, there must be a place that we can communicate each other, but without making the large noise to surroundings. This limit make us to do the effort for finding the right place. Besides, studying alone do not need to find that place. For example, if we want to do group studying in KAIST, we have to register the seminar room before the group meeting. However, we can just go to library if we want to study alone. Or we can study in our dormitory.
Finally, because of COVID-19, we should study alone rather than study with a group of students. During this COVID-19 situation, studying at home is the best way to maintain the social distance. Even if we have an online group studying method like zoom, that is not good enough to concentrate well. For example, the low quality of internet connections give us stress to maintain the group meeting. Zoom also limits the meeting time for the free account, so we have to spend more money to make a perfect condition. 
In conclusion, I prefer to study alone because it can concentrate easily, no effort to find a group meeting place, and COVID-19 situation. Of course this is only my opinion, so there are some students like to study with a group. There is no strict answer for studying. "	4	4	3.5	11.5
187	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are lots of way to study. For example, my friends prefer to study with friends. He said that we can share our knowledge or opinion during study. It is helpful to study and preparing the exam. But my another friends said different. I prefer study with friends. Let me give you some reasons about it.
 First, if we study together I can concentrate more than studying alone. In my case, I play games or watch youtube and netflix when I study at my room. It is hard to concentrate for a long time. But in study cafe, library, and cafe, there are lots of people who studying. In that concentrating space, I concentrate well. Making uncomfortable environment is important for concentration. 
 Second, we can help each other by sharing our knowledge or opinions. When we study new subject first, it is difficult to understand well. For me, I learned linear mathematics first in march, it was really hard to understand it. So I shared lots of idea with my friends, then I could understanding well in mathematics. 
 I share some opinions about advantages of studying together. I prefer to study with a group of students, but it is most important to make environment which is fit to individual students."	3	3.5	3	9.5
188	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Studying style must be quite different person by person. but I don't think it is good to use the only one way to me.
I think those two ways of studying, group and alone, is quite fundamentally different and have to be used at a different situation.

I do prefer BOTH ways, and It depends on what I'm studying right now.
For me, studying alone is really efficient when I'm learning something unfamiliar, hard, and interesting things. I need to focus and write down a new information in my brain.
I can say that math is a good example for both ways of studying. Math give you many concepts and you have to understand them. 
Being taught by others helps you to understand things too, but you have to clarify them while you study alone. 
If you learn 'vector' and all other calculating methods about vector in class, then it is better to study them alone and try calculating methods by yourself.

Studying in groups is quite different. It is really efficient when I need to enhance my skills.
You can't be good at math if you are only good at understanding concepts. It is good when you need to share your skills, solve a hard problem which requires many different skills to solve.
When you need to solve a very hard vector problem, It can be really helpful to study together and learn their various skills. They also can watch my style and get something.
There are thousands of different ways to think and reach the answer, and you can get more of them by studying together.

As a results, I prefer alone style when I have to understand something, and group style when I feel that I need to solve problems in various ways.
My study style depends on my situation and this mixed method works well to me!"	3	3	3.5	9.5
189	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are two types of students about their study : students who study alone and who study with a group of students. It depends on each one's preference, but i think studying alone is better in terms of concentration, efficiency, and internalization.

           First of all, you can concentrate better in studying alone than group studying. While studying alone, you can care only contents and your comprehensions.

But in a group studying, interacting with other students is not avoidable, so you are supposed to care about things that are not related your learning : chatting with others, checking other's comprehension about contents. This disturbs you to concentrate and leads to low learning efficiency than studying alone.

          Secondly, you have to notice an importance of studying alone, not together. To master the contents or subjects, you firstly have to hear a basic explanation about them, secondly, have a time to understand and practice on your own.  The first step can be carried in many ways : asking a teacher, googling. But the second step is an internalizing step for you, so it can be carried only by studying alone that contains your own thoughts, comprehension. The group studying can not do this. 

It is just a repeat of the first step with other students.

         So far, I have talked about the reasons I insist studying alone is a better way compared to the group studying. Studying alone can bring you a better grade and deeper comprehension with better concentration and internalization that the group studying does not have."	3	3	3.5	9.5
190	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"How did you study when you were in high school? Most of you have studied alone, sitting on the desk in the quiet classroom. If not, you have studied in the study room, where the walls are separating every person in the room. These days, different studying method appeared which is called 'group studying', but it is not common. Why most of the person study alone? In my opinion, it is because studying alone is more efficient than studying with group of students. Also, I prefer to study alone by these reasons.
 First, studying alone is the better environment to concentrate. When you study alone, it is very quiet. Otherwise, you tend to talk continuously with friends when you study with many students. Also, your eyes will sometimes go to the friends' textbook, and it will make harder to achieve the daily amount of studying. When I was high school, I have experienced both of studying method. When I studied alone, there was no problem with studying. But when I studied with friends, I was confused because friends were talking things about games, k-pops, etc. Since I realized that studying with friends are not fitting with me, I studied alone. 
 Second, studying together with whom has different study speed or study routine is much harder than studying myself. For example, one student solves problem in 5 minutes, and other student solve the same problem in 15 minutes. However, another student cannot solve the problem. Then the first student will take much more than 5 minutes for going one problem because he(she) needs to make understand the last student. It is same with second student, too. This will happen at the most of the cases, and it is the main cause that drops the efficiency of studying. My math book studying rate was 1 chapter for 2 days when I studied alone. But I took 3~4 days when I studied with friends, because my friends were asking a lot of problems to me. 

Before I go to high school, I thought studying with friends were also good. But studying alone had better conditions and faster studying speed. Because of these reasons, I like to study alone more."	3.5	4	3.5	11
191	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"I think that there are three parts of studying. They are getting to know about something; to understand what it is, taking it into memory, and applying it (for example, solving problems).
With this viewpoint, I prefer to study with a group of students.
  First of all, studying with some people can help you to understand about something better. When you learn about some contents, it is inevitable to face some problems. They can be caused by misunderstanding about details, too hard contents which make you confused, and so on. When you study alone, you cannot correct those misunderstanding. Also, you cannot ask some confusing things and cannot fully understand them. When you study with your friends, you can discuss about those things. Then, you can know more about what you've learned.
  Next, studying together is also helpful for taking things into your memory. When you study alone, the best way to memorize something is just to recite it. However, you can do some great way to memorize when you study with other people. It is teaching about something that should you memorize. When you teach about some contents, you can check whether you memorized it and whether you understood it. Also, when you talk about those things with someone, it helps you to get stronger memory. Actually, the effect of teaching for way to memorize something was demonstrated with some studies.
  Lastly, group studying makes you apply what you learned better. You may have some experiences that you already had understood about something and memorized it, but you couldn't solve problems about it. That means you didn't know about what you should apply to that problems. With your group, you can learn how to apply, and what to apply for it. 
  As I wrote above, there are lots of benefit when you study with your group. Therefore, I think that studying with a group of students is better way for studying than studying alone."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
192	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Although there will be both advantages and disadvantages for each way of studying, I think it is much better to study with a group of students. There are two reasons supporting my opinion.
First of all, we can get solutions for our questions effectively with discussion. If we study alone, maybe it is possible to more focus on individual subjects. However, There is no one who can answer to questions and when they are accumulated, it can make us give up studying earlier. For example, when I was a high school student, I often have a question while studying chemistry and biology. At each time I can't understand the concept exactly, I figured it out with asking to others and discussing with the students who have the same question with me. These always gave me fast answer.
On top of that, it is possible to review the concepts while studying with group. For example, while explaining to other students, we can get more precise understanding of the concept. In my case, I often help my friends with solving mathematics problem and it is also very helpful to myself since I can review the definitions and theorems which I have learned.
To sum up, studying with a group gives us lots of advantages since it is effective and helps us to review the concepts. For these reasons, I prefer to study with a group of students."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
193	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Some prefer to study alone and some prefer to study with a group with others. Each of these studying methods have some advantages and disadvantages, but I prefer to study alone with several reasons. 
  To begin with, studying alone is a better way to concentrate than studying with a group of students. While studying in a group we should talk to each other. I think it is not an efficient way to study because all the students in the group have a different question. For example, let's assume that the group of students are studying for the calculus midterm. Before studying in group, students will have many questions about calculus. The question might be about some questions or about some theories. All the students in a group want to ask questions to each other and it will make a large sound. Although figuring out some questions is helpful, the sound bothers me. While, studying alone I can mark on the problems or theories that I couldn't figure it alone and ask others individually.
  In addition, studying alone makes me to study longer than studying with a group of students. When we study in a group of students, just one person can bother others studying. I have some experience about this. When, I was in high school, I was able to choose to study alone or to study with friends in some particular time. There was a room for studying alone and also for studying in a group. Sometimes I went to a room for studying in groups. The room for studying in groups is free at talking, so some students talk about other things which is not related in study. It makes a bad mood for studying. When just one person talks about other stuff, others might stop studying and talk about it too.  Studying alone, on the other hand, I can study until I am tired. So I can spend more time studying.
  To sum up, I prefer to study alone. I concentrate more when I study alone and I spend more hour studying when I study alone. I do not like the noise when I study. I can study using my own studying methods and it helps me memorize things."	4	4	4	12
194	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Until graduating high school, I didn't need to choose what to do. I just did what teachers said, I just followed what my parents told me to. I just followed school schedule and doing hard, that was all I had to do. But after graduating from high school, my circumstances have changed. I should choose what to do in my free time. There were not many options to choose, but only two options, harder and painful one or easier and exciting one. For last 6 months, I mostly choose the latter. I played Lol in my free time not studying although I need a lot of extra work. I didn't think deeply on math and physics assignment but asked to my friends whenever I faced questions that needs focus and effort. I didn't focus on classes but I slept during the lecture. For spring semester I only choosed easier one. Then my first college vacation started, one day of my summer vacation I retrospected my spring semester. I asked myself, 'what did you do?', 'what is left now?'. I answered, 'nothing'. I realized that I lost my 4 month in kaist because I made easy choices. After that I promised myself to choose hard one whenever I have to make choices. 
 'Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer?', it is a easy question for me if I can tell which is hard one and which is easy one. Let's find which one is harder. Before that, I will set the boundary for meaning of study. Study should be the thing that group study is optional not the one that study together is apparently better. It means that you don't necessarily study alone also you don't necessarily study with a group. In this circumstances I think study alone is hard one and better one. Study need long term thinking which is very painful and hard but in the end that makes me stronger. Study together can share that pain with your group members , you probably think deeper than think and study alone and you might get a better score. But still I think I should choose harder one. Choosing harder one not always make your score higher and your work better, mostly opposite. But I'm sure that it makes you better and stronger and it makes your score and work higher and better in the end."	2.5	2.5	3	8
195	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"When we study with a group of students, we can discuss and share ideas. It may help us to understand more. However in some cases, it may make us hard to concentrate. We can just talk with groups and play except studying. So I prefer to study with a group in some cases: group have enough knowledge to study more and they really want to study. If students in group not good enough to study certain topic, studying in group will not help us. In this situation, I can concentrate in studying more when I study alone. On the other hand. we have big problem or project to solve, we can't study about it alone. We must share ideas and discuss with other students in group. For example, I was in urp program and my teammate helped each other. We can learn more with talking with each other. But when I tried to study final exam with friends, we just played when we meet. It didn't help us to get good grade in final exam."	2.5	2	3.5	8
196	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Today, there are many ways to study. For example, using zoom to discuss about some topics with lots of people, study alone with books, and learn new things from teachers. There are also more methods to study efficiently, but I think the most important thing to consider about their study habit is whether they prefer to study alone or prefer to study with a group of students. In my opinion, I prefer to study with many people for some reasons.
 First of all, if you have some curious things, you can ask them to your group members as soon as possible. When you studied alone, you must have experienced that you cannot solve some difficult problems. In this situation, you should have waited until you meet teachers or friends. However, if you study with your friends, you can ask them to your friends and get answer directly.
 For the next reason, it is helpful for you to answer your group members' questions. Why? For example, you have to know some theories and background information to solve math problems. When you're solving your friends' questions, you can remind theories and information related to that questions again. It means you can study one more time with your friends. Don't you think it is helpful to you?
 Finally, study with your group members make you to concentrate better than study alone. About three years ago, I asked my friends, ""When you study with your freinds, Don't you feel that you concentrate better than study alone?"". Almost all of my friends said, ""Of course. We can help each other, but we can feel that we are racing together, too."" We can be not only teachers to each other but also rivals to each other. Because of this thinking, we can concentrate more on study to win my friends.
 In short, we can ask our questions directly, it is helpful for us to answer friends' questions, and we can concentrate more when we study with a group of students. I think this topic can be really hard to answer because these methods have their advantages. I want many students to experience both of the methods and find the way that fits them better. If they find the right way for them, good results will naturally follow them."	4	4	3.5	11.5
197	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Studying is a hard work. Many people study for various reasons and in different ways. There are people who prefer studying alone. Studying alone has some advantages such as possibility to focus on the point and to develop the skills of studying. However, I prefer studying alone because of the two benefits, possibility to notice errors and encouraged studying by others.
  First of all, I can know what I knew incorrectly by studying in group. When we study in groups, we usually discus each other about the knowledge we know. In this process, individuals talk about what they know about the topic. When someone says the incorrect information other will argue that one is wrong, and they will argue about that point. Because they are in group, usually person who said wrong point will understand that he or she was wrong, so he or she can correctly know about that point, and this is important in learning something. I believe correcting one wrong knowledge is better than learning three new knowledge but finding out what I know incorrectly is too hard to do alone. Therefore, I think it is a huge advantage to notice errors in studying, so this is the one reason I prefer studying in group.
 More importantly, I can focus on studying better when I study in group. When I study alone, I often loss my concentration during study, and do some other things which are not related to studying. However, studying in group helped me prevent losing concentration because other people are studying and I care that they can watch at me. I realized this effect when I was in high school. At my high school, many students study together in the same room and we can also use the small rooms if the student wants to study alone. I used to study alone at the first time, but I could not study well. Therefore I tried using the big room studying in groups of students. After changing the studying type, I could fully focus on my studying, and the grade became better too. Because I experience how studying in group can change my concentration, I know that is the best way of studying way for me.
 To sum up, studying together in group seems much efficent than studying alone for me because of the advantage in correcting wrong knowledge and more concentration earned. I have experience these benefits when I studied to attend KAIST, and I am sure that studying in group can help me achieve bigger goals in my life of studying. "	3.5	3.5	4	11
198	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"I prefer to study with a group of students. There are three reasons.
   First, I can be inspired by others. When I study alone, I usually can't concentrate on studying. But when I study with a group of students, I can see other people who study and think that I should study hard too. So, It can make good result to each other. For example I didn't study much because I always be alone. However I could study well when I participate study group with ZOOM. It's very helpful for me.
   Second, I can ask what I can't understand and explain what others don't know. Most people can't understand every thing, but they can't ask or discuss when they study alone. Then they should search internet, send e-mail to professors and so on. It takes more time. I can save my time by asking to study group members. Also explaining to others makes me understand the knowledge better and get skills of explaining. I explained a lots when I was highschool students, it was more helpful than when I studied alone at that time. Someone says it is unhelpful, but it's not true. And opinion of many people helps me to think diverse ways about knowledge.
   Finally, I can make new friends and they may help me at future. Knowing a lot of people is important in society because people can't live alone. Studying group members study same subjects, so most of them would have same dream. It's likely to work together not only now. Then experience of doing a group studying should make us feel friendly. Not only this case, working with diverse kinds of people helps me when I participate other group working, work at company and so on. I think it is good experience if they don't give much advantages to studying. For instance, a frined who study chemistry with me at highschool takes this class together and gives many help each other.
To sum up, studying with a group of students helps me get concentrate on studying well, understand the knowledges more, and make new helpful friends. For these reasons, I think studying with a group of students is better than studying alone."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

291	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Determining a range of subjects for taking classes is an issue that is often dealt with in our daily lives. There are obviously many opinions regarding this prompt. For example, some people assert that students should study many subjects which include less interested subjects for integration, ~~~~. But it is evident that students specialize in one subject is more beneficial than study many subjects lightly for the following concepts of deep understanding, efficiency, and choice of job.
First, students can deeply understand the major subject. Unless they spend their entire time studying many subjects separately, they can participate in the active learning, which includes long-term activiteisuch as the discussion or their own research of specific topic. Since, students use various methods of studying, students receive background information or advanced information ~로부터 to class, students who concentrate one subjects can understand the contents of the subject remarkably. In addition, advanced information which is earned by the active learning helps to backthinking basic concept. 
Second, students can study efficiently when they specialize one subject. In most cases, the student who wants to specialize the specific major enjoys knowing new topics and theories. Therefore, they can not only understand new theories more fast but also apply the theories to the problems more accurate. These talents and abilities should be specialized by the universities' class. 
Finally, students can easily get a job by appearing their expertise. If they even finish the graduate school, the firm may consider you as developing your own field for a long time, and may believe your ability and technology more than people who widely took classes in many subjects in their undergraduate. Therefore, many firms want to choose you for firms' development.
In conclusion, students should concentrate to one major for active understanding through various learning activities, efficiency caused by your interest, and expanding choice of job. Specializing in one subject is very important for increasing your own unique value in our societies. But, we should also be careful to have a narrow thinking."	3.5	4	3.5	11

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"In contemporary society, there are many discussions that people have yet to resolve, one of the frequently debated of which is taking classes in university. Although some people argue that students have to learn about only a specific subject, I believe that university requires students to take classes in various subject is nice for the following reasons.
To begin with, most of student don't know which subject is proper to them. By taking classes in many subjects, students can experience various subjects and find their interest in one of those subjects. It would help students to decide their major and job. In my case, I didn't have enough time to determine major when I was high-school student, because the goal of my high school life is entering famous university. However, I entered KAIST which requires students to take classes in various major then I learn about 3 majors. Now, I decide my main major and it is very proper to me. Thus, taking classes in many subjects can give these advantages 
On top of that, student can obtain wide knowledge from each subjects. Since the society becomes more complex, people need to study widely than before. Wide knowledge help people to work on various fields and reduce the restriction of major to take job. These days, the ratio of people who change their job increases so student must prepare to this change. For example, google, the large IT company in U.S, want to employ the programmers who are good at either programming and discussion. 
To sum up, taking classes in many subjects help student to determine their major and get wide knowledge. In this regard, I think that university should require students to take classes in various subjects."	3.5	4	4	11.5
293	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are different opinions regarding whether student take classes in many subjects or specialize in one subject. Regarding this issue, some people might say that student must study many subjects because it can make students much more powerful than study one subject. However, I believe that specializing in one subject is more efficient then study many subjects.
 First of all, if students specialize in one subject, they can do various experience. Compare time between students to specialize in one subject and take many subjects, it is clear that student who study one subject have many time. This make students have various chances. Student can participate exchange students and study at famous university in other country, or they can join company to learn how to apply their knowledge. This experiences make students better. 
 Further, it is true that studying one subject is efficient because they can graduate earlier. People's age is very significant at competition. However, if student study many major, it is hard to graduate in 4 years. In KAIST many student study multiple major. However, many students who study multiple major graduate at 5 years. This is because they have to take other major classes. However, in other university, many students graduate in 4 years because they study one major. In fact, 1 year can make difference at competition because many company want young person. Therefore, specialize in one subject is more efficient then take classes in many subjects.
 Finally, some people might think that study many subjects must helpful to students because they can build their multi capacity. However, this is not true. For example, in Korea University, student must study another major to graduate. However, my friends in Korea University say that it is not efficient. He think that this politics make them can not focus on their own major. He always busy because he have to study two major course and he cannot understand perfectly because he don't have enough time to study. This example clearly shows that study many subjects is not efficient at all.
 In conclusion, students specialize in one subject are better than students take classes in many subjects because they have enough time to do other experience, they can graduate earlier, and studying many subjects is not efficient. For the three reasons mentioned above, I strongly believe that specializing one subject is much more efficient then studying many subjects.  "	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
294	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"As the society needs the experts with various knowledge, some universities like DIGIST are starting the education policy that requires students to take various subjects. Some students thinks that this policy is disturbing students' right to choose the major and making experts, but this policy is the best way for students in parts of experience, ability.

 By studying in various major, students can experience lots of knowledge that can help them to decide their future, These days, many high school students study for their college not for their life's goal, so many students don't know what they really want to be. In this situation, how can students choose their major, which is directly related to their future jobs. and become specialize in that part. However, studying in different majors and having experiences about expert knowledge can help them to decide about their goal in life by letting students know about what they like and be good at. 

 Also those experience in different major will help students accessing to the solution of problems in different ways. Since robot and machine technology are developing these days, many workplaces requires creativity to their employers because they don't need blue power any more. Therefore students have to think in different way compare to others to become successful in their society work and their various experience and knowledge will give them many viewpoints of the problem compare to those who are specialized in the one major.

 Some people say that if students study various things, they can't become experts in various parts. Of course, they can't, but society don't need experts anymore since there are lots of knowledge that can be easily found cause of developed information devices. So the important point is creativity not expert knowledge as shown in other paragraphs. As the technology improving, the one major experts become more needless since AI or the Internet can replace them.

 Consequently, the development of technology makes great change in our society and work place. In the past, many work places required experts, but these days they need more creative people. In that point of view, the various major policy in universities is more helpful then one major policy in different way; experiences and creativity."	3.5	4	3.5	11

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are various opinions about the direction of the education. Some people think that letting students to take various classes and to have knowledge on various subjects is the ideal education, and some just think that specializing in one subject is the best. These opinions about education affect to each universities' decision about education and give severe effects on each university's students. There are many discussions about this, and mostly, this depends on the goal of education. Although some think shallow and wide education on various subjects is the ideal way of university education, it is actually true that specializing in one subject is better. There are mainly 2 reasons supporting this.

First, it is because unlike middle school or high school, university is not suitable for the place doing various experience. Most of the students look for a job right after graduating university. It means that, in the age of graduation, the student should have specialized techniques or experience that would seem attractive to the company which they want to apply. Shallow knowledge caused by taking various classes won't give specialized technique to students and this will cause negative affect on students. Some people say that various experiences will give better insight to students, the truth is that this does not give any good effect on application for companies since it doesn't give any specialized techniques.

Second, it is because forcing students to take various subjects might make students lose their interest on studying. Some students are very bad at specific subjects even thought they are very good at other subjects. And forcing these students to take classes that they don't like might make them lose their interest on studying. Some might think it is essential to gain various information to become a better scholar, but if it takes student's interest about studying, that it will be the worst occasion.

There is no exact answer for the direction of the education. It can vary from culture to culture, nation to nation, or even people to people. But it is still true that in the boundary of university education, specializing in one subject is much better than taking various subjects since it will seem more attractive to employers when students are getting hired, and to avoid students losing interest on studying."	4	4	4	12
296	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"In current, a number of universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Some people insist that this method of education is a kind of waste of time because concentrated education is the most efficient way to raise specialized workers. In contrast, I strongly argue that taking classes in 
many different subjects is better way for education. This essay will justify my opinion with several reasons.
    At first, a lot of study of current day are done by not just one subject but more than two subjects at least. For example, most of economics study are performed with advanced physics models. Therefore, lots of economics study project prefer people who studied physics and economics to people who just studied economics. This effect appears in every areas. As a result, because university must raise students who are attractive to industries, it is better way to educate students.
    Moreover, students who take classes in many subjects can communicate with other people more effectively. For instance, a person who studied math classes and physics classes can perform a conservation with another physicist more effectively than a person who just studied math classes. It is a role of universities to raise students who can communicate with people who are in different area. Therefore, it is better way to educate students.
    However, some people insist that taking classes in many subject is a kind of waste of time. They think university education period is short and universities should raise completed students in specified area. In contrast, I think that university education is not the end of education. Universities do not have to raise completed students. It is more important to raise students who can communicate with other people who are in different area.
    In summary, I insist that taking classes in many different subjects is better way for students because it can help students to be attractive to industries and communicate with people. Of course, someone can think that it is a waste of time, but I think universities do not have to raise completed students."	4	4	4	12
297	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Since humans have different backgrounds, humans cannot fully understand each other. This lack of understanding occurs some debating among humans. In that point, specializing or not is one of the most interesting issue among people in universities. Some people argue that students need to be specialized in one subject, not take classes in many subjects. However, there are also people who argue that students need to take classes in many subjects, not specializing in one subject. Both sides are very logical, but I think that specializing in one subject is better than taking classes in many subjects. 

 First, humans do not need people normal techniques. Nowadays, internet is widely opened to people in entire world. People who want technology can get information from the internet because people can update their technology on the internet. This made people to be familiar with technologies. However, the problem happens after this. Since people became familiar with technologies, they do not need people with normal technologies because they can get the information of normal technologies from the internet. Then, people with normal technologies do not have any properties because people do not need people with normal technologies. This is also true for people with normal technologies at wide area. Students taking classes in many subjects will be humans with normal technologies. Although they can cover wide area of problem, it does not matter to their properties. They will become useless. However, think of the people with specialized technologies. People with specialized technologies do not need to worry about their properties because people with specialized technologies are rare in their area. The reason why they are rare in their area is related to their subjects. Since they are specialized in their subjects, they need to spend enormous time so they cannot spend time for other subjects. This investment of their subjects makes the people with specialized technologies rare. Therefore, students need to specialize in one subject, not take classes in many subjects.

Second, specializing is essential to the development. The development of science is from the specializing. Specializing has made our technologies. People with normal techniques but can cover wide area cannot develop the technology because their result is just specialized technologies. They can develop their technologies, but the developed technologies are already developed by the people who specialized in one subject. In short, they are just following the people with specialized technology. Therefore, to develop their technology, students need to specialize in one subject, not taking classes in many subjects.

Lastly, taking classes in many subjects is just removing their money. Students in universities do not need to take classes in many subjects, because the information from the classes can be found at other platforms like Youtube. For example, in KAIST, there are a class that learns about the data structures of JAVA. However, the topic is also in the Youtube, because it is normal technology. However, there is no classes about the experiment about molecules at other platforms because it is one of the specialized technology. Students cannot learn about specialized technologies but can learn about normal technologies. Therefore, students need to specialize in one subject, not taking classes in many subjects.

Some people would argue that taking classes in many subjects are better than specialize one subject because using many subjects they can mix many technologies and produce other technologies. However, I argue that specializing is better."	3.5	4	3.5	11
298	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Nowadays, there exist different points of view about subjects in universities; taking classes in many subjects or specializing in one subject. Some people think it is better to be specialized in one subject, because concentration to one subject makes student be expert in the field. However, I think it is better to take classes in many subjects for following reasons; finding what they really like, wide thinking and 
  First of all, students can find the subject that they really like. In the process of applying to universities, every student in Korea have to choose their major rely on what they have learned in primary, middle and high school. Although there exist many subjects from primary to high school, the important thing is that it is not exactly what students want to learn. Entering universities, students can choose what to learn from hundreds of classes. In this environment, students get to take classes which they have wanted to hear or they have never experienced. Students have high possibility to find the field that fit to them. Specializing in one subject will not give students these kinds of experience and students will just believe what they are learning is what they are mostly like and good at.
  Taking classes in many subjects is good for students not only in personal satisfaction, but also in their wide thoughts. One of the key aspects of 4th industrial revolution is mixture of the fields. For example, one of the main technique of 4th industrial revolution, IoT requires not only excellent computing but also knowledge about machine, even knowledge about user's minds. Also, in the process of attracting consumers to use certain item, people tend to view design as one of the most important aspects of devices. Therefore, mixture of knowledge from many fields leads to wide thinking and better item that fits to needs of contemporary people.
  Last but not least, students can make friends in various majors. One different point of life in university from life in high school is that students do not have to be concentrate only in study. Rather, students can do activities that can improve themselves or work on various activities with friends such as events or group activities. In this process, students who hang out with various type of friends have higher possibility to think one problem in various views. However, if they only have to hang out with friends with similar thoughts in same majors, their thought can be narrowed down.
  In conclusion, I think it is better to take classes in many subjects because students can find the subject that they really like, have wider thoughts and make various type of friends. Taking classes in many subjects is one of the significant thing in universities compared to other schools and they would better utilize this chance."	4	4.5	4	12.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are many students in KAIST who think between taking classes in many subjects for fusion and specializing in one subject for getting strength in one field. I think that specializing in one subject is better than taking classes in many subjects. There are three reasons for my opinion.

First of all, if we take classes in many subjects, we cannot have a lower specialty in one field. For example, in the Department of Materials Science & Engineering, all students are taught about the introduction of chemistry, physics, and biology. It may seem good, but many students can't get depth knowledge about any one field of science. So, it eventually can make students lose their force to perform strong studies, and lose at competing among other science major students.

Moreover, specializing in even one subject is very hard for university students. According to my lab professor, there are many students to do double major for achieving fusion between two major. However, he said that there are also many students that miss their core major subject since they are so busy to take other major classes to get a title of double major. So, he advised that concentrating on one subject is much better than taking classes in many subjects. And in his empirical, it is said that students who study one subject in depth usually do better performance in graduate school.

Finally, students who specialize in one subject can get a better opportunity in the field of industry. Compared to the students who take classes in many subjects, they have a bigger possibility to solve an industrial problem because they have a higher understanding of one field. So, they will catch more opportunity to revise an industrial problem.

For these reasons, I think that specializing in one subject has more strength than taking classes in many subjects. Although the students who specialize in one subject may be hard to fusion two subjects, I think that the fusion of the two subjects is possible for students who already specialize in one field. So, as I mentioned before, specializing in one subject is better."	3.5	4	3.5	11

Some people argue that digging one pond is good and even focusing on one subject is not easy. But, I would like to claim that students should take classes in many subjects rather than one subject.

We can have many advantages by taking classes in many subjects. First, We can gain various knowledge and technology in many subjects. In KAIST, all freshman students have to take the various classes in many subjects to graduate KAIST. It means that taking different subject classes is helpful since KAIST graduators have done a great job on various areas. Also, these various classes can help to understand our subjects by connecting points.
In addition to the first reason, cooperation (working together) is most important features in today. To work with another person, it is good to take classes in many subjects. For example, if we are studying for integrating parts,  then it is obvious that all people know the parts of other person's major is effective since we do not need to teach others.

In conclusion, there are many good points of taking many different major classes such as various knowledge and cooperation ability. So, it is clear that universities should require students to take classes in many subjects rather than on subject."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are still controversies about universities should require students to take classes in many subjects or to specialize in one subject. Among them, some people say that students should specialize in one factor to be more specialized person and to have high-level thinking. However, I think students should be required to take classes in many subjects for following three reasons. 

To the begin with, when students take classes in many topics and subjects, combining two or more of subjects could be easier for them and can have additional knowledge. In recent days, there are many research topics that combines two or more topics and requires the knowledge of other subjects. In addition, there are cases that knowing only one specific area is not sufficient to resolve the required problem. For instance, sometimes, designing and computing is required for mathematics when researchers should have to found optical way in problem solving. 

Second, it is much easier to contract and communicate with people in other area when students get their jobs. When students have carrier in the future, they will meet many peoples in many parts. To communicate and have a talk with them, students should have to learn and research about the language of the other area to understand specific contents. For example, the students who have learned about mathematics can contact with computer scientist to make formula about society communication and develop the platform. However, if they don't know each other's subject and language, the communication must be much difficult for them and will need more time for them to explaining to each other, which is not an efficient way. In addition, they both should study about the contents about the society if they don't know about it too. 

Lastly, students can have more creative thinking, if they can learn majority of subjects in the university. The word 'creativity' is often thought as a 'new' or 'fascinating' ideas. These thinking can be brought when someone combines one area with another area that nobody considered before. For instance, Davinchi had found many things ny

In conclusion, I think specializing in one area might have advantages for some students. However, learning the other subjects might have more benefits for the students because students can have additional knowledge be combining two areas, can be much easier to contact and communicate with other area people, and can have more creative thinking.

But specifically, we may have in trouble weather university requires you to take classes in many subjects. Both are have advantages . In South Korea, there are four word historical words, ""다다익선"", it means more resource will make better result. So, we can interprete take multiple subjects is better. 

First, it will get advantages for our nation. In management class, the term ""range of economy"" means one factory with provide multiple products or services will earn more benefits rather than one product or service factory. Because of this situation, provide multiple products or services can potentially take large customer pools and also reduce backward cost by actively adopt common factors technologies. By this, we can understand, our country may reach more efficiency for utilize human resources. More over, we can find our unknown abilities by interact with lots of new subjects, it will increase your results of your papers and also it can make chance to make new state-of-art technologies.

 Over the past few years, there is much controversy about whether university students have to take classes in many subjects or not. In KAIST, every student is required to take variety of subjects in their first year even if the department they want to go to is decided already. There might be some people who believe that taking classes in many subjects is good to be able to acquire various knowledge and helps to decide the department . However, I disagree with the above idea and agree with the idea that specializing in one subject is better for the following reasons: It can increases students' major expertise , and students can get more time planning their future after graduation.

 One of the most essential reasons is professionalism in major. Fields of interest to the student themselves usually occur before entering university. 
Even if I see my friends around me, there are no friends who have completely changed their interests after admission. The advantage for specialize in one subject is that you can greatly increase your knowledge of your major.

 Second, student can graduate ealier, which gives us ample time to plan your future It's common for UK universities to go to various companies to intern in their fourth year after three years of intensive major education. I think that it is possible because the curriculum that emphasizes majors rather than requiring students' knowledge in many fields. Actually, KAIST requires students to take many liberal arts and various subjects, so many students graduate in 5 years.

 In contrast to my side, many people still claim that taking classes in many subjects is helpful for getting various knowledge; however, I still believe that it is not true. Since there are some differences between what we learn in college and the actual situation, I think it is more efficient to specialize in major education for 4 years.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"People have different points of view about the diversity of subjects students take. For example, some universities require students to take classes in many subjects whereas there are some others that require students to specialize in one subject. Universities which prefer specialized students in one subject argue that focusing on one subject has the advantage of having better expertise. Although the idea of ""Deep and narrow is better than shallow and wide"" is true, I prefer students to take classes in many subjects for two reasons.

  First, all subjects are connected. Students cannot succeed just because they are good at math, and students cannot succeed just because they are good at physics. When it is time to utilize the subjects students have learned, they should eventually integrate them with other subjects. For example, suppose a student only learned mechanical engineering. This student has no knowledge other than mechanical engineering, and he wants to participate in robotics research, a branch of mechanical engineering. However, since robotics is also very closely linked to biology, this student will have a lot of difficulties in the research process.

  Second, students don't know which subject is suit for them. Most majors and subjects are determined when students graduate from high school and enter university. However, young students at this time are still inexperienced and don't know exactly what they will learn in college. Universities should provide these students with more opportunities to experience and set up a system to take various subjects.  

  In conclusion, because of the connectivity of subjects and the instability of young students due to lack of experience, universities should encourage students to take various subjects. A number of students change the subjects they are learning and taking at university. Universities should reduce the time wasted unnecessarily by students' wrong choice of subjects."	4.5	5	5	14.5

There are many universities in the world, and their types are all different. In some universities, they require taking multiple classes to graduate; on the other hand, other universities require learn a single major deeply. In my thought, learning multiple majors in the university is more helpful for students for some reasons.
 The most important reason why I argues for taking classes in many subject is contemporary world requires knowledge about many things. In a century ago, there are many subjects to do study, and we just need knowledge abut that. However, in nowadays, it has been harder and harder to work only in one major; instead, they have to get an idea from different field. In this perspective, taking multiple majors because it can make our view larger. For example, algebra and geometry look like different field of mathematics, but they can work with each other by using coordinates.
 Following to the first reason, sometimes we have to use other field's knowledge to do our study. For example, statistics are used for many fields. Even biology, and some majors in social studies requires knowledge about statistics to work. In this case, someone who majored mathematics can do a study fluently.
 Despite of these reasons, some people argues that specializing in a subject is better because taking classes in multiple subjects is less professional in the main major. However, we can collaborate with others, to make a better idea. Collaboration with people in other fields making a new knowledge that never exists before. In this case, knowledge about other's field can help talking and collaborate with each other.
  By taking these reasons, requiring students to take classes in multiple majors is helpful for students because it helps making new ideas, working with the study, and collaborating with other. Nowadays, collaboration is the most important to make a new knowledge, and teaching multiple subjects allows us to make pioneers of our future."	4	4	4	12

Even if some people insist that take classes about one subject is better choice. I personally prefer that take diverse subjects for the following two reasons.   
    To begin with, knowing about various field is helpful. we face uncountable situation in life. To solve this situation, we need to know about not only one specific subjects but also other field. My personal experience is a compelling illustration of this. I learned Japanese when I was young. At that time, I thought there was no reason to speak Japanese at all, but thanks to learning Japanese, I was able to answer questions when I met a Japanese at an amusement park.
    In contrast to opinion that take diverse subjects is better choice, many people still claim that take classes about one subject because if we study many things, we may not be able to do anything right. However, because each subject is linked, studying other subjects also helps to understand another subject. For instance, though I like only physics, I studied overall physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science because I went to science high school. However, In studying, I notice that the thermodynamics of physics and chemistry are similar and physics was used a lot in earth science.
    In conclusion, I strongly argue that learning about many subjects is better than specializing in one subject because learning various subject is helpful for both to solve the problem which we will face and to understand other subjects. Considering the two reasons discussed above, it is clear that taking classes in many subjects is more helpful."	4	4	3.5	11.5

"Considering the contemporary social aspects of the mordern universities, there are two contentions; that is, whether taking classes in many subjects or not. Some people argue that taking lectures only related to their major is crucial because that's more efficient to learn. However, I regard taking various range of classes is important based on the following reasons. 

The first reason is that the students can find their interests by taking classes in various subjects. For example, many of Kaist students who can take other subjects which is unrelated to their own major frequently change their major. Many students can find their own interests by taking different categories of lectures.

The second reason is that taking many classes can help students to get practical advice. Learning the knowledge related to not only the major but also the liberal acts is important. For example, the students who took the ""Modern war and conflict"" lecture can learn how to live to avoid and solve the conflict. These kinds of knowledge are crucial for real life, but it is not able to learn from their major classes.

Someone argues that takes the lectures only related to their major is important for the professionality. However, it is not true because learning from the classes which is not related to the major also helps them. The doctor who treated the cancer which is almost impossible to care said that he can treat the patient from the book telling the way of how to beat the war. It proves some important idea which can change the world is originated from totally different things.

To sum up, Taking numerous lectures is crucial taking account of finding their interests and getting the practical advice. Some people contend that learning in one subject is more efficient for their speciality but other subjects also helps the student. Even though. studying their own major is important, learning various area of subjects is also helpful for their life"	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

The number of total subject is directly connected with students grade, happiness, and so on. So it is important to decide weather one subject or more in class. This essay argue about the three point that why university need to take many subjects; effective study, effective evaluation, fewer risk.

First, many subjects can help effective study. University students almost do not spend a lot of time to study because there are so many things to do. And they usually start the subjects right before the deadline. If some classes give one subject to students in each semester, they may study the subject just one time. Even they could study about just one part of the lectures which is relative to that subject. This is never effective way to increase their knowledge. Students need to study with a cycle, and various subjects help them. 

Second, evaluate student with just one subject is not a good way. In one lecture, they learn a lot of thing and each students have their own interesting. For example, let's assume that student A is interested in chapter 1 and not good at chapter 2. And professor give a subject about chapter 2. Maybe, A is going to get a lower score than his ability. Therefore, universities need to evaluate various ability in students with a many subject.

Finally, many subject decrease the risk. There are unpredictable situations in our lives. Before the deadline, students can get damage on their product, or computer viruses, emergency situation, and so on. Following reasons, some students cannot complete their mission in time. If there is just one big subject, the risk is so high. Many separable subjects protect students from these bad situations. 

In conclusion, because many subjects bring effective study, effective evaluation, fewer risk, university need to make many subjects in a class. Some people think one subject is much more simple. So some students may feel stressful about a lot of subject, but they will satisfy about it in the future."	3	3.5	3	9.5

So almost of high school students go university and there are many universities in world. The principles of education are various by universities. The main educational argument among universities is 'taking classes in many subject vs specializing in one subject.' . Although some people claim that specializing in one subject is better for students, I believe that taking classes in many subject brings more good educational effect to students. There are several reasons of that.
  First learning various subject can give students the opportunity to find things they ever knew. Many students in high school, particularly in Korea don't have much time to find what they like , what they want to do in future, and what kind of potential ability they have. Their interests and potential ability only can be found by many directly doing. University, which have many exerted professor is best place to give that abiity.
  Second They can make friends in another department. If students only learn their one major. They don't have enough chance to meet friends in another department. Making different people who major another field is very precious thing in one's life. Because it opens one's eyes to larger world and it improves one's ability to communicate other people. Communication ability is necessary for these society.
  In despite of these reasons, some people says that studying one subject enough and is more important to students, because of there are many things to learn in just one major and four year is not enough time to master it. It is right. However the these days society really want for people is not perfectly knowing alone but ability to communicate each other. And also there are advanced school.

It was an organization for research, the only source of breakthrough. Then companies with mass capital setup their own research facilities, leading new breakthroughs. Time by time, universities became concentrated at education more than research. Also the educational requirements of workplaces generally increased, several small universities were even considered as a place for job training. Nowadays, numbers of universities are facing new problems caused by upcoming changes in this rapid developing technology civilization. If they could not handle new requirements, they will not be able to evade termination. Universities must give students diversity in their subjects to flexibly deal with those problems.
 The first reason why universities should offer diverse subject's educations to the students is the rapid changing workplace. For example, product designers have to know what digital circuitry is needed to make sure the design with LEDs or digital interfaces can possibly operate. Even if they doesn't know deeply about electronics, at least they should know it's possible or not. Programmers working for web sites are required to have knowledge in art and design. Those requirements did not exist in last centuries, but it is becoming essential. 
 Even though, there are several opinions that diversity in educations lower the quality of itself. However, this is restricted on a specific portions of diverse jobs, such as researcher. In a situation that adapting to new job requirements is required, spending time on one subject causes the students to lose their possible chances for practical job educations. Also, most of the students enter universities without knowing what they really want to do. University is now treated as a place for finding job preferences.
 In conclusion, the change of workplaces require new workers armed with diverse knowledge. Universities should follow this trend to offer students new diverse educations that they need. Being specialized on a few subjects causes risk of loosing time for this era's students."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"All over the world, university students have to choose between taking many subjects or specializing in on major. Some people argue that one major is more efficient because through that, university students can become a specialist of their major. Of course, this idea is true, but I regard that taking many subjects is more important based on the following reasons.
  First, by taking more courses, students can find their interest in those courses. Knowing what they want to study and research at once rarely happens because it is difficult for students to know their interests in subjects before they study those subjects. In KAIST, one of Korean university, runs a special freshman program, which is actually choosing a major after freshman semester. students can select and take lectures by themselves. Then, after their freshman year, they choose their majors based on their 1 year experiences. This methods can bring students chances to experience their future majors, and a better choice can be followed after.
 Second, these days, many researchers conduct studies which are mixed area research. For example, a bio-engineer studies species by using big data and AI technologies. Traditional biologists may study with biological or chemical processes; in contrast, current ones do so with other area's technologies. Therefore, considering the current research trends, it is good for students to learn various fields, and for universities to give students various courses in order to make competent researchers.
   In contrast to my side, many people still argue that there can be waste of time and resources during studying many courses. However, I still believe that large background knowledge is better than deep one. Taking many courses must be take times and energy, but this is not a waste, rather it is investment. Past experiences are the seed that will grow and give us achievement. In other words, sowing many seeds have more possibilities to make fruits. Thus, it is good to study various fields for future achievement. 
 In conclusion, considering the factors above, it is easy to say that taking many courses has many benefits. Situation can be different person by person, but people in their age twenties are still young to take risks and challenge. In other words, spending times to look around various fields can not be a large risk in their life. Students still have to enjoy the chance to be bore ambitious."	5	5	4.5	14.5

"As people live, they circumstance other condition, and sometimes change environment or make special product which can make their life more easier. Moreover, there are big 4 industrial revolution as people live in earth. In name of revolution, each revolution involve, job and lifestyle are changed dramatically. And now, we are live in 4-th industrial revolution. AI are main issue in this revolution, which can evolve itself and learning speed is much more faster than people. Some people might says 'Many job will substitute employees to AI'. This means people might lost their jobs as soon. To win this emergency, people should study in universities and make creative think to lead society. Some people says university should make students to specialize in one subject. But as society becomes more complex, technology needs to make creative idea and inter-communicative thinking. For this reason, I would say universities should require students to take classes in many subjects.

 For the first reason, People can't win robot. Many scientist make game-playing robots from past. From the chess robot, now is Alphago's era. Many people says robot can't win go because there are so many kinds of behavior in one turn, and it is on;y human's sense. But all of people knows, Game result was 4:1. People absolutely lose. And even one win was belongs to Alphago's error, We can't say people is better than robot. And many people are surprised that this robot is learned this knowledge by machine-learning. This means, robot can learn types of knowledge by oneself. this means human can't challenge robot with their knowledge. They are already knows everything and they has super-massive speed. Then, how can we win? I think it is depend on creative and mix. There are not manual such as mix each type of knowledge, robot has no idea to mix idea or knowledge. so people's creative idea to mix knowledge is only one thing to win this robot. 

 Second reason is level of class. In university, many professor says that undergraduate level class is basic. So, though you put your all time in just one subject, You are just knowing basic level of one subject. But if you learn many subject like math, computer science,...etc. Then you can think common point and different point at all subject. This can make your knowledge variety. If you go graduate school, you should research and make some many experiment. This variety knowledge will give you much more strong point.


 Third reason is your sight. At same event, people who learn many subject can think at variety sight. This people can analyze reason or effect at many sight and it can lead to most effective analyze. But other are different. People only one think just make one sight, and it would think that he or her think is only idea for this event. This is loss for other reason or effect. So Many idea can make your sight broader.

To complete this essay, this article show that  students to take classes in many subjects has many advantages for 3 reason. As society become complex, many think and creative idea is more important at this time. I agree that people should have broad idea and make society more better. "	3	3.5	3	9.5

    Nowadays, some universities like KAIST, UNIST, POSTECH, and the universities which have a specific admission case make students take various classes in many subjects. However, other universities' students except for those kinds of universities mentioned previously can take classes in only one subject. People think the second method efficient because of the depth of study. Although studying one subject has advantages which taking classes in more than one subject does not have, I think studying various kinds of subjects is better due to two reasons.
    First of all, requiring students to take classes in many subjects makes the number of feeling like a failure of choice decrease. Even if people like the subject which they choose first, they can have another subject that people also want to learn. Therefore, if universities make students study more than one subject, people can study a subject which is the next choice, then, the percentage of disappointed thoughts with the first choice decreases. Although people want to change the main subject to another one, the rule of universities for the subject makes people feel less disappointed.
    In addition to the student's feeling, the number of students who are similar to a person required in a company increase. For times progress, students have to study many subjects as lots of company need the usable person who can work in many cases of working. However, the range of study in one subject is limited, then, students cannot learn widely if a university ban studying more than one subject. Even if a university does not make a limitation of the choice for class, the subject makes students who are not the last order of getting a chance to take a class. Therefore, the rule of taking classes in many subjects can give more chance for students to study than the rule of taking classes in one subject.
    To sum up, there are two rules for giving the power for students to choose the classes in the subject. The first method is requiring students to take classes in many subjects, and the next method is requiring students to take classes in one subject. Although both methods have advantages in each case, the first method can make students feeling better for their choice, and make students more needed in society. Therefore, I think universities which require students more various study is the better university."	4	4	3.5	11.5

          Most of the students consider what will be their major before entering university because students have to choose their major for applying to university. While some universities do not require a choice of major before entrance. If students go to these universities, they choose their major after about 1 year or more year. They do not have a major, they have to take classes in many subjects. Some people said it is better to specialize in one subject. However, it is better to take classes in many subjects than to specialize in one subject because of the following three reasons.
          First of all, it helps brains are developed to combine each subject; for example, there are many connections between chemistry and physics. Most reactions in chemistry can be described by physics. The student who learns physics and chemistry together can understand chemistry reaction easily compared with the student who learns only chemistry. Like this, there are many connections between each field even music and math. 
          Next, it helps to grow the ability that required complex thinking. During learning various subjects, there must be walls that interrupt one's thinking such as hard math questions. To solve this problem, people have to think in various ways and keep trying. A person who tries to think complex in various fields can improve his ability to solve problems. It can be used in not only study but also normal life.
          However, some people said it is more helpful when someone works at his or her workplace to specialize in one subject, but it isn't. For instance, many people are required to produce a new phone such as product designer, engineer, and a person who is good at marketing. A phone that has high quality doesn't be sold when it has bad marketing. So, it requires co-work by various people from other fields. Understanding other fields are the most important point for the best work.
          In conclusion, taking classes in many subjects is better than specializing in one subject. It will be more helpful for developing the brain to combine each subject. Second, the ability that required complex thinking must be developed. Moreover, it needs at the workplace. Many universities and companies want people who are good at corporations and many fields. It will be helpful to take in many subjects."	4	4	4	12

Daily life had significant differences due to the appearance of computers. Among the various discussion topic, the debate topic ""Do computers make people's life more convenient or not?"" prompted people to take different views. Some people strongly believe that ""Computers have made life more complex and stressful."". But I would like to make an argument against them that ""Computers have made life easier and more convenient.""

Some people are concerned about possibility which people's jobs substituted by computers. They argued that people will become more stressful because of decreasing occupational rate as computers appear. But I believe that computer does not take people's job away because computers' specialized jobs are different from people's. As computers developed, segregation with tasks that people make the better results and computers do appeared. Therefore, it makes our life more convenient.

Other people pointed the problem that older generation cannot adjust to environment with computers. For example, most of grandfathers have a difficulty to use the internet for shopping. This can make older generation complex to daily life. However, there are so many education programs for older generation to teach about using the internet. And these programs help older generation adjust well to environment with computers.

Somebody can argue that stressful and harmful effect caused by electromagnetic waves appeared as computers invented. Actually, exposure of electromagnetic waves for a long time deliver people stressful feeling and diseases. But electromagnetic waves which computers make were so small that people did not has an effect. And there are many panels which prevent from harmful waves. So convenience due to computers are more effective that stressful affect by them.

In earlier paragraphs, I delivered an argument that computers have made life more benefical and some refutations to counter-arguments from now on. Through the earlier paragraphs, readers can understand about convenience which computers make. I hope readers become more familiar with computer because it takes various advantages to us."	4	4	3.5	11.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"The society has agonized about whether computers have made life easier and more convenient for a long time. However, socially agreeable answer has not appear yet. Some people argues that computers have made life easier and more convenient; on the other hand, the other stated that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Between both sides, I agree with the opinion which argues computers are beneficial to human beings for following reasons: providing various contents, supporting complex calculations, and increasing accesibility of informations.
       Firstly, computer provides various contents to people. It allows people to enjoy online games, stream movies, and chat with other people, regardless with time and place. Nowadays, a lot of people enjoys online games like League of Legends, and watch movie through streaming platform such as Netflix. They can enjoy these contents because of computer, which makes long-distance submission of videos and real-time interaction possible.
      Secondly, computer supports complex calculations. computers can deal with complex calculations not only accuratively but also quickly. Therefore, it can solve equations that human cannot solve, such as equations for QR decomposition for large matrices. By solving those equations, computers extends the ranges of sciences which human can deal with. As a result, technologies that benefits human beings are invented much faster.
      Finally, computers highly increases accesibility of various informations. Some people may state that there are plenty of worthless informations in the internet, and people can obtain high-quality informations at libraries, so computers have not contributed to increase accesibility of useful informations. However, through computer, people can access informations without limitations of place and time. Moreover, they can obtain only useful informations by using faithful sites. Therefore, computers highly increases accesibility of various informations, which helps people to get informations that they need.
     To sum up, computers have benefited human beings by providing various contents, supporting complex calculations, and increasing accesibilty of informations. Therefore, I totaly agree with the opinion which states that computers have made life easier and more convenient."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"In 21th century, a computer is treated as one of the most closest and helpful tools to people. Although it provides significant advantages for people, some people argue that their lives became complex and stressful while others like the benefits from its convenience. There are two different aspects of computers, and I still think that computers have made life easier and more convenient for following reasons.

First, people can save time by using computers because its speed of working is much faster than human. As a simple example, writing something on paper with a pencil is significantly slower than typing it with computers. As the purpose of the computers as a tool is to help people work more efficiently, it is true that using them can result convenience and time-saving. Moreover, computers are used in the area of making and moving robots which help people to do dangerous or repeated tasks such as cutting metals or coloring cars.

Next, using computers takes an advantage that people can work on-line. If people do not use the tool, they should complete some stressful tasks by themselves such as sending a mail through a post office and wait for a person who they want to meet until he or she has time; however, if they use a computer, they can send an e-mail or contact the person on-line. Furthermore, in the period of COVID-19, the computer gives people an on-line lecture. Because of the disease, people have to stay home and can not visit their schools for lectures. Many people considered about a way to give students a lecture, and by using computer, they can teach their school members on-line with some tools such as ZOOM. 

However, there is a controversy that a computer is hard to learn, and the hardness make people stressful. It is true that learning a computer is difficult because people have to memorize the location of alphabets in keyboards, how to send an e-mail with some contents. But, once they learned about basics of the computer, not the complex parts of it such as coding, the benefits from using it come more significant than difficulties in learning it. And, learning basics like typing, web-surfing is not really hard comparing to their worry.

To summarize, because of a function as a tool, a computer benefits people's lives in aspects of time-saving and providing on-line circumstances. Although some people worry about a difficulty in learning the computer, I think that computers have made people's lives easier and more convenient because good things from using it comes bigger than the difficulty."	4	4	4	12
318	Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"One of the most controversial topic today is whether computer made life easier and convenient or computer made life more complex and stressful. Although some people claim that computer made life harder, since there are more things to learn and life become faster, I support that computer made life easier for three different reasons; e-mail internet, e-mail and programming.
First, the invention of the internet is one of the greatest invention through human history which made human life easier. The internet helps our life in many different ways. One of the main function of the internet is searching.  Before the invention of internet, if you do not know the recipe of certain food, you have to find someone knows how to make the certain food and ask them. However using the internet, we can search unknown information through web-browser and there are millions of information collected from people in all over the world. 
The second function of computer that helps our life is the e-mail. Before the invention of e-mail, in order to contact with friend who live far, we should either send a mail or go see the friend which take long time to contact. With the help of computer, we could communicate with others immediately using e-mail. These function further developed to the messenger such as kakao talk and zoom that people could communicate asynchronously.
Lastly, today there are many computer programs that helps our life. The computer process with the codes and if you are professional developer than you could make any program that you want. In most of industry, people make programs using computer to control machines. Learning programming is not an easy task, but it is important in development of many 
In conclusion, computer made our life easier and more convenient in terms of information, communication and programs. The internet enable people to find millions of information made by various people. The e-mail and messengers enable people from far away to communicate asynchronously. The programming enable people to do anything they want. learning how to use the function of computer which could be complex and stressful however when you are familiar to use computer then your life will be easier and convenient."	3.5	4	3.5	11

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"Humans have come up with wise solutions through debates on various problems throughout history, and now we are facing controversies surrounding whether computers have made our life more better or not. Some people argue that computers changed our life more complex and stressful. I assert that computers developed our surroundings and made more convenient. There are three reasons; we can do work everything in house, we can buy things what we want easily, we can save our money more convenient and safe.

First, we can do our work in house. Nowadays, every works in most jobs are done by using computer. For example, NAVER APP developer coding the code for developing app on computer, and architect designer draw things on computer. These works are done by computer and it can be done in house, because we just set computer in house and turn on it. It can save time and more convenient than go to company every morning. Moreover, working in house can save us from getting COVID-19.

Second, we can buy things that we need easily. In Choseon dynasty, people should go outside and buy food, cup, and many other things in off-line marker. In addition, people couldn't buy things from overseas. However, today, we can buy food and clothes on computer by just click the button in house. For example, people can buy food through LOTTE-online-shopping and buy clothes on MUSINSA. Thus, people don't have to go outside and buy things more convenient. Also, shopping in house can save people from getting COVID-19.

Nevertheless, some people think that using online banking is very complex and dangerous. However, I believe that using paper money is more complex and dangerous for managing. Because, paper money can be hurt, hard to save, and easy to lose it. However, by using online banking, money don't use real space and people just put credit card in her wallet.  Moreover, stealing money become more complex, because stealing paper become to hacking the system. Thus online banking by computer in more convenient than using paper money.

Computers changed our daily life in shopping, working, and saving money. According to above, today's our life is more safe, more convenient and easier than past. We can do almost everything in our house by using computer even i write this essay. Doing something without stress of place is the best advantages in convenient. Therefore i assert that computers developed our surroundings and made more convenient."	4	4.5	4	12.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"All the development of technologies have both good points and bad points on people's lives. Some people may think that their life became more complex and stressful by the development of computers. However, I think that our lives have became easier and more convenient as the development of computers for the following three reasons.
  First of all, the communication between people became easier as most people use computers or phones. Before the development of SNS, the quick conversations were impossible. When someone had to talk with other people, they had to use telephone call or go for face-to-face talking. However, most of all people communicate with SNS, while very few communications are performed by face-to-face conversation in theses days. These SNS system could be developed as the rise of the use of computer and internet web. Also, the relationship between people has developed and conversation has increased because talking or chatting is easy and convenient on SNS.
  Not only the convenient conversation but also the convenient use of money is a important positive effect of computers. These days, people don't need to bring bills or coins to buy products. They only need small cards or their phones. Calculating money with bills and coins might be complicated and cause problems such as the cost of long time for finding coins. These days, by the kiosk, consumers can pay money easily without talking with workers. Additionally, consumers can buy products at home for internet market. They can compare products easily and get them by package system without bringing heavy bags from the market. Only some clicks at home allows them to buy easily. As they reduce time for buying or paying money, they can use the time for other purposes. In other words, the process of paying money became faster and efficient.
  Finally, the development of computers helped other developments of technologies. Computers can perform calculations or simulations in very high speed than humans; as a result, people can research or enhancing previous technologies faster in research labs or factories. The more computers are used, the more developments can be occur. Most of the technologies which make people's lives convenient such as wireless machines, public transportation system, smart phones with higher qualities are based on computer system. Moreover, experts say that extreme level of development was shown in recent 100 years as the development of computers.
  To sum up, I think the development of computers had a great role for making our lives easier and more convenient because the computers have allowed convenient conversation using SNS, efficient money-paying system and great development of all technologies. People should use the technologies in right way receiving all good points of the them including computers."	3.5	4	4	11.5

There has been a long controversy over using computers in life. Some people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. However, I think that computers have made life easier and more convenient for three reasons.

First, computers help us to get information easier. It is normal that everyone has curiosity when we study something new. Some people prefer to resolve their curiosity by finding books or dictionaries. In contrast, using computers can find the information we want faster than before. In addition, there are some web browsers which automatically programmed based on big data. Using that web browser, we can get further information or complement information. For that reason, we can get advantages of getting information when we study.

Second, computers can help us as a tool to compute our complicated and repeated tasks. Imagine that there is a complicated experiment project which requires many calculations. In that case, calculating in hand can make a mistake and can affect the result of the whole expriment. On the other hand, using computers in that case, there are no possibilities to make any mistake and the speed of the process will be more efficient. In that aspect, using a computer can also give us advantages.

Last but not least, computers can help us enjoy and relax. Some people argue that playing computer games or watching media(drama, movie, etc) can be dangerous because that can result in them to pain-mode on computers. Nevertheless, if we have some time to manage computer using time, the possibility to get in pain-mode will be very low. And the more, we can get relaxation with computers.

To sum up, some people disagree with using computers since they are worried about the complexity of computer systems and the dangers of spending much time using computers. However, if users manage their using times efficiently, they will get more advantages of getting information, use them as a complex calculator, and a way to relax and enjoy."	4	4	3.5	11.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"Of all discussions that surface in contemporary society, the debate over whether computers have made life convenient or stressful remains controversial. Some people may assert that computers deprive leisure time and increase our stress by making people are too dependent on computer. However, I strongly belive that computers achieve conveninent life on now for the following reasons. 

FIrstly, computers be able to perform several complex tasks instead of people. Before the invention of computer, people should calculate all calculus equation by their hands, and it spends long period to complete even with mistaskes. Some people might argue that people become too dependent on compure, because it can handle the things to do so easily. However, people can gain  more leisure time by reduce their meaninglessly wasting works and feel satisfaction from enjoying another hobbies.

Secondly, computers are particularly capable to deal with on-tact works. Nowadays, although strict limitations ban people's ordinary behaviors on life, computers get rid of the virtual Covid19-wall among people. It is true that, if there was no computer, people would meet each other and spend more time. Nevertheless, computer performs the role of essential key on now and people maximize their happiness that stealed from Covid19.

In conclusion, computers have made our life more easier and conveninet by saving human's time. Furthermore, computers are clearly essential to retain nowadays' ordinary life against Covid19. After computer was invented, human obtained freedom from samely reciprocal works and it allowed people to use their time more colorful. Without computer people can't enjoy their life fully.

323	Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"The discussion of whether computers have made life easier or more complex and stressful has always been an argumentative one for the modern times. Even though many people claim the fact that computers are one of the significant elements that cause stress and complexity due to the fact that they had extremely increased the responsibilities and competition, this essay asserts the validity of the argument that computers have made life better and more convenient as a consequence of the following justifications.

    To begin with, it would be natural to observe that computers have enabled people to do many things when compared to the past. The evidence suggests that the growth of possibilities is exponential. To illustrate, modern people are able to access information and data instantly by means of the computer networking called internet. Moreover, by means of this beneficial invention, anyone having an internet connection can communicate to a person who is thousands of kilometers far away. Even more, by means of the power of computation, people do not have to perform error prone, tiring and boring calculations which might be very crucial for a scientific project. When those huge benefits are analyzed, it can be seen that the freedom of contemporary people had been increased remarkably when compared to past. Thus, claiming that computers have not give humanity a chance to make their lives easier, would not be reasonable.
   
    Another important aspect that computers have a great role is that contemporary people live longer and healthier. According to the recent data, the expected lifespan of humans have increased by five to ten years in the countries that advanced in technology. Since it would be possible to directly related computerization with technology, this data would be a direct indicator of one of the huge benefits of computers. To analyze the contributions of computerization to the health industry; examples of computer modellings of human body, more accurate treatment devices and robotic supports in operations, can be given. Therefore, the role of computers in health industry is inevitably important.

    Besides the facts that computers have such great advantages, many people claim that computer have made life very complicated and stressful. The underlying reason behind this claim is that the capability of computers to perform various tasks without significant human effort. When this is the case, the level of the jobs that humans are expected to do have been increased dramatically because the evolution of computer industry is extremely rapid. In that case, it might be the case that people have adaptation problem to this situation. However, people should not think in a self-oriented way in that situation. Since the evolution of ideas and life had always been the reality, the same complexity and stressfulness will not be a big burden for the next generation as they will easily adapt to this situation. For the current generation that may have those issues with computerization, they should get educations on how to efficiently utilize this device and technology. Thus, those issues can be seen as non-permanent and fixable issues.

    To conclude, it would be possible to indicate the fact that computers are very beneficial for humanity in terms of making life easier and more convenient when compared to the past. Even though there might be some issues regarding the computerization, it would be possible to show that humanity will adapt the computerized society soon in case they intend to obtain the proper education. Thus, in order to improve the standards of our lives, investments in computer industry would be a beneficial and highly profitable one."	4.5	4.5	5	14
324	Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"As we live in new era, where everyone can share their own opinion freely, there are different thoughts about using computers in daily life. Some people think that using computers facilitated many processes in their life, making it more comfortable and easy.Whereas, others claim that computers have made life more complicated than before. I strongly believe that new technology such as computers have more positive effects on our daily life.
        Firstly, it is worth to mention that every field  started to develop faster after invention of computers.Because, computers treated as a source of power, that effectively changes people. Also, even though computers have been created  by human being, they have good memory and functions, which helps to easily analysis big datas comparing to  people.For example, in quantum chemistry scientists use quantum computers that computes complex functions and gives appropriate results, whereas people an able to compute that kind of functions.
       Secondly, our daily life become much more convenient as everything started to digitalised.It is the consequence of using computers. Because, computers are capable of doing many functions in a short period of time in compare to people.Therefore, it is much more convenient to use computers instead of people.In addition to this, computers do not ask money.In other words, computers are best option for economic development.
       On the other hand, we should consider that using computers can lead to some diseases, and make people's life more stressful.For example, sitting in front of computer for a long time can lead to heart disease. However, it is the case, when people use computers for too a long time. Using computers for short time period do not affect people's health.
      In conclusion, even though using computers can have some bad effects on our life such as making life complex and stressful, the contribution of computers to the fast development of the world is much more worthy."	4	4	3.5	11.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"As technologies are being improved more and more, computer are taking more and more place in our life. Some people might argue that the computers have made life more complex and stressful, but I think it is clear that the computers have made life easier and convenient.
  First, computers can do things what people can't do. Computer can handle and compute massive amount of data in short time with out any error. Without computers,  people would have to compute complex numbers to do simple work for computer such as calculating earring of the month. 
  Second, computer can do things what people don't want to do. Computers don't become tired. It can do boring computation again and again all day long without a break. For example computer can classify all products on the internet, which is hard and boring work for people. Thanks to computers that do boring and time consuming things instead of people, people can concentrate on more important things and enjoy their time. 
  These days, computers are used in everywhere in our life.  Computers  can do what people can't do, what people don't want to do. It is hard to imagine life without computers.  If computers are disappear suddenly, the life will be more complex and stressful. Thanks to the computers, our life became easier and convenient."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
326	Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"Let's think about the things that we enjoy. Movies, cartoons, illusts, Youtube videos...etc. If these things will be disappear at the moment, can we enjoy the life? How about the documents, reports, papers? Is it okay? Because of this, I agree with the opinion that computers have made life easier and more convenient. There are 3 reasons that why.

First of all, by using the computer; we can find and share informations very easily. To be more specific, thanks to the word processor, we can type letters on the document file in the computer. This is important, because of the lasting time. When we save the document file in the memory of the compueter, without any physical force; we can find and share the informations any time, and to anybody. Several experts said that the 21st century is the period of information. We can earn the informations by each other and able to develop the society together. This is one of the reason that why computer make life convenient.

Second, computer is a good tool. According to the result of Jean Pierre, who is the professor of the Harvard University, he said that human can memorize 10% of the conversation without any writing. For example, if we take the one-hour lecture without any writing, we can only memorize for 6 minutes. By contrast, according to the Jean Pierre again, if we take notes for the conversation, human can memorize 80%. Let's focus on this result. To memorize the informations of the conversation, we need to take notes. However, human's hand isn't fast as much as needed. To take the notes, human neeed to find tool. That is the computer, which make life easier. 

Finally, computer is faster and efficient than human. Because of the high-concentrated information circuit(hereafter abbreviated as IC), computer can compute every calculation, even if it is difficult. In case of the differential equation, human can solve linear form only. In case of the non-linear differential equation, human cannot find the answer because we need approximate the equation. Due to its enormous size of the calculation, human's brain can't solve it. On the other hand, IC, which have about millions of brain on the chipset, can calculate it in few minutes. Efficiency of calculation of the computer bring us the convenience.

To sum up, computer is the good tool to us. Without computer, we can't develop the society. This is the reason that why I agree to the opinion: computers have made life easier and more convenient."	3.5	4	3.5	11

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"After the invention of computer, people has made many tools and academical results that made our life more convenient. However, some elders face difficulties in using computers. Although some people claim that computer made life stressful, I believe that computer has improved life for the following reasons.
 First, people can do their work faster with their computers. There are a variety of tools that help people's work. For example, Microsoft Office assists people to write their files with Word and make sources for their presentation with PowerPoint. Without them, people have to make their sources with hand, and it needs more time than using computer. In addition, people can do their group work well with some applications; Kakaotalk or Google docs. With applications based on Internet, they no longer have to move to meet their team, so they can save much time. 
 Secondly, people invented lots of other tools that made people's life more convenient. For instance, with computer, people invented smart phones, subway management system, and etc. Nowadays, people don't have to work a lot with those inventions. Moreover, computer can do a machine learning; constructing an AI and learning with big data. With those AI, people's quality of life will be improved a lot because they can drive a car, cook some food, and solve some simple problems. People can study or enjoy their hobbies during the AI is helping their daily works.
 It can be argued that computers have made life more complex because there are too many things to study to use computers. On the contrary, the saved time by using computer is much more than time which was spent by learning the way to use that; besides, the using computer has become easier, too. Computer programmers are trying to make simple and effective user-interfaces like one-touch systems. Furthermore, there are some computer programs for old people or children. 
 In conclusion, computer made people's life more easier because it made people work faster, there are many inventions with it, and controlling computer is becoming easier. Since the development of computer is rapidly, people won't have to do simple and tired work in the future."	3.5	3.5	3	10

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"Despite a wide variety of interpretations and discussions, opinions about how computer changed our lives have not been narrowed down to one. Although some people think the computers have made our life more complex and stressful, I claim that computers have made life easier and more convenient.

Thanks to computers, we can use various data more easily. Computers has the large space to storage information, and it doesn't take to much space compare to the information in paper. if the computer had not been developed, people might have to work with the large amount of papers on the desk. Also, because the computer has better computation ability than people, we can assemble data fast and correctly to make the result that we want. 

Even in the case that computers are not used for the data work, computer made our lives more convenient. One example is the bank work. Through the past, until the computer has developed, people had to go to the bank themselves to save money, or send money, and etc. Because banks are the places that only run before the 6 p.m., going to the bank had made the schedule more complex. However, people can use the bank services by their own computer now. Therefore, people can modify their schedule more flexible.

These days, computer has been one of the must-have item and almost everyone has a personal computer now.  Although some people would feel stress due to the complex stages of the work made by the computers, it is obvious that computer has helped us working with data, and using time more efficiently."	3.5	4	4	11.5
329	Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"Since computers were invented, there have been arguments about whether computers make life easier and more convenient, and even now, they make controversy. There are two main perspectives. One is that computers make life easier and more convenient, and the other is that computers have made life more complex and stressful because they made people work outside the workspaces and cause various of diseases especially for eyes. Though, second perspective is lso persuasive, I think computers have made easier and more convinient because they offer a lot of softwares that can entertain people, improve the productivity of people, and connect people to people.
 First, computers have improved our productivity in workspaces. Before the computers have invented, when people want to get statistical informations, they needed to calculate and compare all the values they got from their investigation. In contrast, after the invention of the computers and development of spreadsheet office program, all the statistical analysis have been able to do with just some mouse clicks and draggings. Therefore, people have advanced the ability to use bigger size of datasets which are more meaningful than small datasets an improved work efficiency. 
 Second, computers have connected people more closely. After the invention of computers and distrbution of internet services, various types of online communications have been created. These new communication tools have different characteristics to other communication methods like phone call and SMS(small size message of mobile phone), for example, Facebook, one of the most popular SNS nowadays, have a simple-blog like form of communication. When people want to share somthing, then people write and upload a short post with pictures. And then other people who have access permission to that post can read it and write comments. That's how people communicate through Facebook and it is unpresented way of communication before. Through various form of communication that computer offer, people have been able to share more about themselves to other people, people have got closed each other.
 In other perspective, computers make people stressful by let people work outside the workspace. However, the stress from work is not from the computers, it's from the work. Before the invention of the computers, people didn't work outside workspaces, however, they worked for more than 20 hours, in 19C. Because of the improved productivity by computer, people can go back to their home, not always work in workspaces, so working outside workspaces cannot be the bad effect of computers, reversely, it's an evidence of more comfortable life than past by computer.
 The computers offer people productivity-improving tools and connect people. Although the computers also make people work outside the workspaces more frequently, the inconvinience and time-wasting caused when the computers are not present are much bigger than that bad effect.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"Nowadays, many people contend with each other about whether computers have made life more convenient or just stressful. Some people may assert that computers have made life more complex and streesful; however, I strongly believe that computers have improved the life more easier.
To begin with, computers help people by connecting all people to ubiquitous network. I think that computer is the first device for ubiquitous network, and it means that people not only can get various information such as a weather forecast immediately but also break the boundary between people in different places and time. People are connected with each other by the computer network; therefore, there is huge convenience for people who live in the modern society and the revolution of information because they can work together whenever they are, and wherever they are. For instance, people can do their work or study in the colleges because of the development of computers and ubiquitous network system, even in the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows that the value of information from computers is much higher than the stress caused by computers.
On top of that, people can alter their labor by computers and increase their work efficiency. Of course, some people can claim that computers will alter all humans because people do not have advantages in the workplace, and this is why people feel streesful on computers; nonetheless, I believe that people have to give their simple work to computers. It is well-known that computers are not good at some regions such as analyzing images, creating a new idea or emotional work. Not only these regions but also many parts of human work need people's creative brains, not just mathematical calculations. If people use computers only in hard work that cannot be done by people or takes too long time to finish, computers can help people and people can live more easier with their own jobs. This occurs in various parts such as the design, the research, and even the work at the factory now and almost people in that workplaces tend to recognize the need of computers.
To sum up, computers can provide ubiquitous network so people can work together whenever and wherever they are, and people can give some of their simple work to computers to increase the work efficiency. In this regard, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient. I think that there is no reason not to use computers if there are advantages from computers in appropriate parts."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"In this contemporary society, computers are one of the most necessary items to live a life. And in relation to the computer's effect, there has long been a discussion. Some people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. However, I think computers have made life easier and more convenient for the following reasons.
First, computers can improve the efficiency of work. It can do works that human requires a long time, like calculations or word typing, in a very short time. For example, a few weeks ago, I forgot to bring my computer when I went to a library to study. Because I only had a note and a pencil, I wrote a note by hand. It took a very long time to write all of them compared to when I take a note on a computer. So there is no doubt that the computer saves time.
Next, we can easily enjoy our free time with computers. Without a complex procedure, we can enjoy many exciting things like games, television programs, and even a concert. For example, when you want to see a concert at a concert hall, it needs many time and money. However, if you use computers, you only have to turn on the computer and enjoy it in your room freely. With computers, we can not only enjoy various activities but also save money,
Finally, with computers, we don't have to move long distances. We can easily work or listen to a lecture at home. Also, there are many shopping applications, so we can easily buy items at home. Computers reduced our efforts to move a long distance to do activities.
For these reasons, I think that computers make our life better. And I believe computers' improvement will cause human's more convenient life."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"After the invention of the first computer to solve German secret message during the World War 2, computers started to be used in various fields to make systems automatic. However, this automatic systems made complex problems such as privacy problems or unintended errors so that people started to doubt convenience of computers. Despite the opinion that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I still believe that the computers have made modern life more convenient for the following reasons.  
 The first reason that computers have helped life to be more convenient is computers reduced repetitive works in modern life. The representative example is calculations. In the field of bio-science, computers are used to find specific DNAs that cause serious diseases or disorders in the whole enormous genome data. Also, in the field of economy, since computers automatically calculating taxes based on each citizens' income, government could make fairer tax systems than before. Like these examples, computers' repetitive works enabled people discover new facts and even gave time to concern about more innovative thoughts.
 Some people might argue that the development of computers brought complex questions as well as new facts like the unknown reasons why computational facts and real life fact is different. But I believe that like the invention of computers 
 In conclusion, computers had many benefits to make life more convenient. Furthermore, as computer technology evolves, computers will enable us to do more things."	3.5	4	4	11.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"Computer is one type of technology that has been invented and significantly impacts people's life nowadays. Over the last few years, there have been and arguments about whether or not computers provide several advantages to human society. Numerous people argue that it results in better and more convenient life. On the other hand, others concern about new problems that can be emerged because of this technology . Indeed, I believe that computer can bring more complexity to everyone's life.

One major argument is that people can communicate with one another easily due to computer. There are various websites and applications that allow people to send messages via their platforms, such as facebook, and email; therefore, people can communicate with one another although they are staying in different place. On account of this features, it provides the advantages for both of working with colleagues living in other countries and contacting foreign investors to expand business.

However, the opponents of the idea which supports the advantages of computers state that the emergence of computer also lead some problem which must be taken into account. For example, in case of health problem, if individuals use computers for a long period, their eyes might be hurt. In addition, sitting on a chair with unsuitable position can cause a person to have a back pain.

Another issue relates to ethnical problems. It cannot be denied that the introduction of computer associates with the development of cyber space which can be seen as another world of human society. In this world, it allows people to express their identitiy while their real ones are unknown. Hence, it allow people to behave inappropriately without concerning about the impact to their real life. For example, many individauls can post the hate speech related to a person they do not satisfy.

In conclusion, although the computers can make people life easier, it comes up with new serious problem. Since the development of this technology continues, it is impoartant to find the appropriate way to manipulate new emerged problems."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"Computers become widely used in the era of science and technology. Some people say that the upcoming technology of computers have made life easier and more convenient, but others do not agree. They say that computers have made their life more complex and stressful. While those people think like that, I still strongly believe that computers provide comfort and easy life by several supporting reasons: ease in communication, and information accessibility.

With computers, people could solve one of important problems in the past that is communication problem. If we look through the past, it took pretty long time to communicate with someone far away. At that time, people may use birds or horses as the fastest way to send letters. The presence of computer make the ease in communication through the internet that link every part of the world with social network. With this technologies, we could contact with the person who we are missing or want to talk with using just several seconds. Phone is considered to be a small computer which is a good example of how it make more convenient on the communication such as video call, email, chat application.

For the second reasons, we can obviously see that computers provide the convenient in the accessibility of the information. While people in the past had to go to the library to search for the interested information or look at the newspaper, people in the world of technology do not have to do that. With computers, they can use search engines to find whatever they want to know; for example, the recipes of dinner, various categories of news, weather forecasting, and also GPS. People do not need to waste their time for looking at many books to get one knowledge as plenty amounts of data are now in the internet, which could be looking by computers.

To summary, ease in communication and information accessibility are just two out of plenty reasons to support how computers have made life easier. Although some people would argue this statement with some computers' disadvantages, I am still sure that computers have changed the world to be a better place."	3.5	4	4	11.5

Numerous people's daily lives would probably consist of using options such as email, online texting, handling documents, watching movies, etc. However, the issue about whether computers influenced life in a positive way or in a negative way remains controversial. Regardless of benefits that computers offer, sometimes, people are overwhelmed or addicted to the programs they use and feel uncomfortable. Although some people argue that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I insist that computers have made life easier and more convenient.
 First of all, there exists an argument that people get confused and feel complexity because of severely numerous options that computer offers. Especially when it comes to the old, people can easily observe old people not knowing how to handle electronic devices including computers. However, this kind of difficulty occurs because computers deal with numerous tasks in a short time. By understanding basic manuals to use computers, people will be able to complete a number of tasks with less effort and their life will be much more efficient and convenient. 
 Second, some argue that people's lives became stressful because they can easily be addicted to the entertaining programs. It is true that people now have numerous games, movies to be addicted when they use computers. Also these kind of entertainments are usually not easy to overcome. However, there are also useful options that prevents addiction. If we use anti-addiction programs that limits the usage of time, etc, we can effectively shut it down. Therefore, computers provide good options.
In conclusion, computers have made life easier and more convenient for two reasons. Although using options of computer might be difficult and people can be easily addicted to them, computers could provide us with so many useful options including solutions for each problem. As technology advances, the function of the computer will also be improved. It would be interesting to observe it."	4.5	4	4	12.5

It is undeniable that most of our activities are done with computer, just like attending a lecture, doing assignments, contact with other people, and so on. Looking at this dependence on computers of our life, someone claims that the computers have made life easier and more convenient, but I believe that computers have made our life more complex and stressful with following reasons.
    First, working on computers has many negative effects on health. People have to focus on monitor screen, which is close to their eyes, for a long time. Consequently, it gives a massive stress to their eyes and neck. This finally results in bad eyes and turtle neck syndrome. Computers must have the responsibility on the increasing of the number of people who wear glasses. 
neck. Moreover, people tends to sit long time in their chair due to computer jobs, so it causes less physical activity, which is not good for overall health.
    Second, people have to learn more and more tools and programming languages. As computer technology is being advanced, It becomes even harder to 'use computer well'. In fact, the meaning of the person who is good at computer has been changed. In past, It was enough to use computer programs well, such as excel, word and powerpoints. Nowadays, the ability of coding is required to make their own programs. People have to learn programming languages like java, python, and c++ to do an advanced work on the computers.
     On the other hands, someone may say, it is true that computers made our life convenient. However, I think that computer is just doing simple jobs, so what are remaining for us are complex jobs. Also, computers do the work fast; we have to do more dense work. 
    In these reasons, I think that have made our life more complex and stressful."	4	4	3.5	11.5

Although some people might say that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I strongly believe that our life has become more convenient thanks to computer.
   First of all, computers can do so many things that humans can not even try. For example, computers are able to calculate about 10^12 times faster than human. Therefore, there are no need for people to spend countless times on our daily occurring calculations. Also, computers enabled us to storage thousands of documents, videos, recordings, and so on. Before computer was invented, only thing people could do to save their works was writing down on a piece of paper. But now, thanks to the enormous amount of computer's storage, people are able to maintain their results.
   Secondly, computers are the key factor of using internet. Nowadays, it is almost impossible to live without an internet. People use internet everywhere at anytime; order products from website, email each other, or use internet banking. Because of the development of computers, people could easily access to internet, which made our life much more convenient and easier.
   In conclusion, thanks to the computer's ability and access to internet, people's life become way better and easier than before. There could be some complexion or stress due to using computer  , but the benefits are beyond its negative effects."	3.5	4	4	11.5

"Living in the modern world, the issue of whether computers have made life easier or complex is a discussion topic that we encounter at least once. Some people even claim that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I still assert that they made our life easier and more convenient.

First of all, almost every piece of equipment that we use nowadays are including computers. Especially, that we cannot live without them. For example, a smartphone is a small computer that we always bring along. It will be a great pain to live without a smartphone for a day. We cannot know where to go, what to eat, and what to do. Not only a smartphone but also the home appliance such as dishwasher, and washing machine include computers. It is obvious that they are making our life much more simple.

In addition to the idea that we are already using lots of computers, it is clear that computers are essential for next-generation technology which will make our life more convenient. Many computer scientists around the world are working on a new computer that leads to the technological revolution. In particular, AI is a computer-based technology. AI can replace humans at hard work, and reduce risks or hardness of human's life. 

Nevertheless that we are already using lots of computers and much more in the future, some people still claim that computers make more hardness in our life. They assert that SNS, which is based on the computer makes complexity between human relationships. However, there is much more advantage. We can easily get daily news from SNS and communicate with other people without contact.

In conclusion, I claim that computers have made human life much easier and more convenient. For reason, we are already using lots of computers in our daily life and we cannot live without them. Also, computers are essential for the next technology such as AI which will make our life on another level. Moreover, some people might say that SNS, based on the computer makes relationships harder. However, there are more benefits."	4	4	4	12

There have been massive and fierce controversies about whether computers are helpful for our lives or not. Certainly, various opinions may exist. One side argues that computers have made life more complex and stressful. This is contradicted by the claim that disadvantages of computers much less than the advantages of those. In addition, when the development cause easily and the society more complex, people should adapt and changed their movements and reactons. If they should not change their situation, they will dissapear in the progressive world. However, in my opinion, there is no little doubt that computers have made life easier and more convenient for the following reasons.
 To begin with, computers led a development of technolgy. This is because computer can make people deliver the infromation for other people much more easily. It is evedient that it is comfortable to get and give informations compared with the the past without computers. In the past, if people want to search data, they ask and direct experience. Nowdays, it is easy to get search and read paper in the internet. In addition, the developments of technology make our lives more easily and improve the various academic terms like science, math and art. 
 On the top of that, computers give a chance for education. In fact, Africa and asia childern are hard and dangerous to go school, and  they can not achive to study. However, the social company like world vision, and Unichef give them to study. The imbalance of education is not problems for developing country. It can also occur in Korea. In the spring, COVID-19 virus happen and many peole restrict to movements. Furthurmore, the children must stay in home and study using online school classes. 
 Finally, Youtube and Google have tremendous media and vedio to give indrect experience. For instance, People who want to go outside and go abroad experience activity in home. If people want to get informations, they just search on goole and learn how to do. Moreover if you want to watch past drama, it is easy to wach you tube.
 To sum up, Some people claim that compuer makes our more complex. It is evident that society more complex beccause of increasing entropy in the view of nature science. The developments of tecchonogy, broad chance to education and indirect experiences is possible due to computers. In this regard, I belive that the computers have made life easier and more convienient."	3.5	4	4	11.5

The issue of whether computers have made life easier and more convenient or computers have made life more complex and stressful has always been a hot potato in modern society. Although some people think that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I argue that computers have made life easier and more convenient for the following reasons.

First, by using computers, we can access information we need much more easier than before computers were developed. Also, we can easily calculate very complicated calculation by computer and do more meaningful things at remaining time.

Second, we can make full use of working at home and online lecture by computer particularly circumstance like now, pervasion of COVID-19. If we do not have any communicational devices like computer, our life could differ extremely to life before the outbreak of COVID-19, more than now.

However, some argue that computers have made more complex and stressful by these reasons. They insist that using computer change lifestyle more indoor and make posture bad for neck and waist. And advantage of computer that people can achieve things without moving cause people not to move at all. As a result, there can be a problem caused by shortage of workout. Of course, these problems can be cause by using computers; However, we can overcome them by making advantage of remaining time earned by computers. People can surely improve their work efficiency by using computer and using that time by workout then it would be more better than not using computer. Even though some problem can be occurred by using computers, advantage earned by using computer is more huge. So I argue that computers have made life easier and more convenient."	4	4	4	12

Although some people suggest that computers made life more complex and stressful, I believe that computers made our life more convenient. Here are some reasons. 
  First, computers can give fast information from all over the world. As a result, people could learn something which they did not know before faster. For example, people in Korea could know the result of the American president's vote result immediately through computer news. Moreover, the computer can calculate tons of information during the science and mathematical experiment. for instance, most KAIST students experience experiments that analyze information by using the computer. Also, the computer is a core part of the development of the entire technology of current. and the computer allows anybody to access information. so, we can expect equality of information through computer technology. Finally, computers could gather people who have different backgrounds and cultures. therefore, people are able to cooperate easily by using a computer. However, there is a risk of using a computer. despite fast information, false information exists too. and some people claim that they have to treat more information which causes people to be stressed and work because of the computer.

Some people claim that computer have made computers have made life more complex because modern people should understand how computers work. However, in my opinion, computers have made life more convenient for 3 reasons below. 
   First, computers replace human labor. In the past, people calculated all things such as costs and data by their hands. On the contrary, people do not have to treat simple work, so computers have made life more convenient. People who say computers have made life more complex argue that computers can make fatal error. However, computers are much faster and more sophisticated than humans. 
   Second, computers allow communication with people easier. Nowadays, almost of people have social network service account. They can communicate much more easily through social network service than in the past. Opponents argue that social network service reduces people's direct contact. However, it is true that contact with people has increased significantly compared to the past. Therefore, people can maintain a closer relationship with each other.
   Third, computers provide a large amount of information. Nowadays, people can easily get information at any time by the Internet. Some opponents argue that people may not be able to make decisions easily based on too much information. However, it is good enough if people select the information well.
   In conclusion, computers replace human labor, allow communication with people easier and provide a large amount of information. Therefore, the argument that computers have made life easier and more convenient can be persuasive."	4.5	4	3.5	12

There's much controversy about inventions of computers. There might be some people who believe that the computers make their life more stressful. However, I personally believe that computers brought many benefits and play a very important role in our modern life.

  First of all, they do every task faster. Considering the fact that time is a valuable factor in everyone's life, when you give your computer a job you are sure that it will be done in a blink of an eye and it is not going to take much of your time. For instance, before the computers were invented, we had to do a large number of calculations by hand and not only did it take a lot of energy and effort but also it took a great amount of time to calculate what we needed. But these days these type of calculations are no longer a human's concern. In the fall semester of the university, I had a project in “Program Language”, a very difficult course with huge and long coding and calculations. Having a laptop and a suitable software on it, I managed to accomplish the project before its deadline. As you can see a computer facilitates and accelerates many works that we used to do by hand.

  Second, they provide various sorts of entertainment for people especially for children. Computers include many video games for different age ranges and a variety of tastes.  When I was in high school, I did not have a laptop for some financial reasons. I was living in dormitory and there were a lot of free times that I did not know how to fill. I had to spend my free time sleeping or staring at the wall. As a result, huge amount of time was wasted and I was often bored and totally confused about what to do specially when I just finished my study and did the assignments. This experience taught me that if you have a computer you can easily fill your spare time with a diverse beneficial software programs on this device.

  Nevertheless many people argue computer make their life more complex and stressful. However I believe that invention of computers is the greatest useful innovation. For this reasons, every company use computers everyday, and they can't do anything without computer's software programs. I can say that we can't live one day without computers.

  In some, even though some people may believe that computers have made life stressful and more complex, but I intensely think that the opposite is true. Note only do they do many jobs faster than ever, but also they provide a large variety of entertainment for human. I advise every office and home to have at least one computer and make a good use of it in its most proper way."	4	4	4.5	12.5

Some say that computers make life more complex and stressful; but in my opinion, computers make life much easier and convenient.
These days, computers are advanced enough that it could assist human in a wide range of tasks. For instance, computers are used as tools for communication via social media and messaging applications. Without computers, there is no other tools that can ease the communication to this caliber using the internet. Moreover, developers has created many applications to make use of a computer to the limit, such as document-editing applications, digital clock, calculator, and calendar. All these applications can make life easier by turning everything to digital. Users no longer need to buy or find an access to tools to make their life easier as computer can act as a multi-purpose tool. As an example, it is cheaper and more convenient to use a timer on a phone than buying a watch and use it as a timer. Furthermore, with the internet, everything can be done online: shopping, watching movies, file storage, etc. Although users may not have the exact same experience of actually doing these tasks, it is less time-consuming and more convenient to do them online.
Even though some may say that computers make life more stressful, it mostly depends on the job and person rather than the computers themselves. For example, jobs like programmers that mainly use computer can be really stressful, but it is due to the task that they are doing using the computers. It is agreeable that the computers are complicated, but so as any other tools, it takes time to get used to and fully gain advantages out of it. People with a lot of experiences with any tools, they often find that the tool is very useful and easy to use. In addition, computers can help relieve stress. With computers and internet, users can easily access entertainment like games and movies. 
To conclude, rather than make life more complex and stressful, computers make life easier and more convenient. Some could say that computers make life more complex and stressful, but it is due to themselves and their experiences for not getting used to it and not being able to understand the convenience that computers could bring."	5	5	4.5	14.5

One of the most crucial changes is related to the improvements of computers which become nearly the most essential thing in daily life. The issue of whether computers have made life easier and more convenient or made it more complex and stressful has always been a hot topic over decades. Although many people argue that computers are changing life in a more sophisticated and stressful way, I still believe in the opposite direction where it actually makes our lives easier for the following reasons.
  First, it can be seen that computers are having human dealing with complex tasks which happens everyday in the modern life. Computers appears almost in every field of work ranging from factory and company to school. For example, engineers can use computers for coding to control robots in factory that enhance the accuracy in producing products. The work that human can make errors are now replacing by the hand of robots which increase the efficiency and profits for many companies. Thus, computers help reducing the labor workforce and supporting human with providing quality products.
  Another beneficial factor that computers help us is they faster the way people communicate each other. Nowadays, people can call their friends and relatives over the internet faster than before due to the improvements of computers. In addition, the way individuals exchanging letters also different comparing to the past. If in the past people had to wait over months for letters to be transfered, now they can just simple write their emails in few minutes and send them over internet for just few seconds.
  Despite the positive reinforcement of my idea, some people still claim that computers make our lives harder because they make work around us more complex. However, I should say that we work to make others lives happier. If we can see our friends or parents can live happily in this sophisticated world, then the enhancement of computers to make those things reality is worth, right? Computers help the lives of our relatives become more convenient.
  In conclusion, it is true that computers are actually trying to provide human with more convenient life. Although the hard things can appear sometimes in our lives, we should continue move on and trying our best to contribute to the development of technology especially computers to make others people in this world live easier."	4.5	5	4.5	14

"By the importance of studying at universities has arised recently, there has been immense discussions arguing about wheather requiring students to take classes in many subjects is better or specializing in one subject is better. Both opinions of each sides are outstanding. I would like to stand on the side of requiring sepcialization in one subject to students since, first, strong specialization in one subject has benefits , second, taking classes in many subjects requires immense time, and last, specializing is more efficeint than the other.
 First, having specialization in one subject has benefits after graduation. Most students will find for jobs after graduating to earn money. As high quality job requires high knowledge or profession, specializing in one's major will have an advantage. If students take calsses in diverse majors, their knowledge might be diverse but depth won't follow. Since our society wants depth rather than variation, working hard in on major is an appropriate method for students. In addition, most universities gather students with certain majors and have seperated departments like department of electrical engineering or department of social science. This feature of universities support the idea that specialization is important. 
 Second, immense time is required for taking classes in diverse subjects. Most universities are scheduled to graduate after attending for four years; which means, there is no enough time. Even if a student registers a lot more courses than the others, it might fail to achive all the courses successfully as there are lots of things to do, but the time is limited. Some might argue that attend more years at university will be the solution, but students have to go through the next step of their own career. They cannot study at university for whole time. 
 For the last, specializing in one major is more efficeint in studying. If one studies many subjects, most of contents students learns are seperated. On the other hand, studies in on magor are all connected like a map. Knowledge obtained from a particular lectrue will used to the following lecture and courses. Therefore, majoring is efficeint than studying many subjects. 
 In conclusion, universities requiring students to specialize in one subject is better than the other. Of course, it is the problem for the university to decide, for the reason of benefits after graduation, limited time and efficeincy, specializing is helpful."	4	4	4	12

"With the rapid development of computer and IT techniques, over few years there have been immense arguments about whether computers have made life easier and more convenient or they have made life more complex and stressful. Both opinions of each side and their bases are truly outstanding, but I'd like to argue on the side of computers have made life easier and more convenient.
 First of all, computers have rased work efficiency highly in almost every profession. In simple tasks, by automation and fast processing speed, computers can complete a task in seconds which takes days to complete for a person to work. About 50 lines of program codes can finish a task which 50 person does, even more faster. Even in complex tasks which essentially requires a person, computers can help people work much efficiently by lots of supporting programs.
 Second, computers are playing a big role in education. Easy accessibility of data by internet technology has made students' education much more efficient. Rather than using only limited information and pictures on a textbook, teachers can also use a huge amount of media on the internet. With the development of AR technology, students now can not only imagine the shape of a Tyrannosaurus via text information on a book, but they can also see the realistic 3D-Live video of a Tyrannosaurus through their cameras.
 Moreover, Artificial intelligence and Deep-learnig technology can liberate humanity free from labor. Now A.I can do most of things which people used to do, and by the development of technology, it will soon take most of the hard and difficult, dangerous work people used to do.
 To sum up, computer technologies have made life much convenient. Some might say that there may be some problems by the developments of computer technology, such as game addiction and job losses, but I think the positive side of the developments are much more to humanity."	4	4	4	12

Because it can make very fast and very accurate calculation, it could be applied to many field and made huge differences in various aspects. It is also applied to our ordinary life. As computer became more and more advanced, our life has been changed according to such change. However, there is some conflicts about does it made our life more easier. Although some people say that computer made our life much more complicated, I think it made our life definitely easier.
 The first reason is about its multi function. One example is video. Before computer, the major media was the pictures and texts in the paper. To watch the movie, or other kinds of videos, people should go to the theater. For common people, it was hard to watch such videos easily because watching videos required very complicated and expensive equipment. However, after the development of computer, it became more easier to watch such videos. There are many video player in our computer like gom player or windows media player, and they does not require complicated knowledge. Some opponent may say that there is also some problems in those players like video codec problem, but the programs automatically give solutions to such problems. Also, the development of information technology enabled online video platforms like Youtube, and it is much more easier that such players. As a result, such players and platforms made watching videos much easier. Like video, many other process like illustration or copying became much easier thanks to computer's easy programs.
 The second reason is about information. Before the development of the computer science, the major source of information was newspaper of journals. The number of such medias was limited, and not opened to all people around the world. For example the people in Korea could not see New York times easily, and such differences could occur according to the person's social position. Compared to these old information sources, computer is very convenient. The web browsers like Google have enormous amount of information in its server data, and we cam find these data with just one click. Now, people don't have to read library index to find information because the computer find information with its fast calculation.
 The last reason is that consumers don't have to understand the complex principles of computer. A few opponents say that the mechanism of such programs is very complicated, so when their is problem, it is hard to understand the problem and hard to find solution. But mostly, we don't have to find such solution manually. Most of the solutions is automatically drawn by the program. Although the program does not give precise solutions, people can just follow the solution on internet. Of course, there can be some errors which is very hard to get information about the problem and solution. In this case, however, people just go to the offline A/S center and follow the way of experts. There are no needs for the mechanisms for the program.
 To sum up, computer made our life more easier in aspects of its function, information, and problem solving. Thanks to it, our life became more easier. We need to be more appreciate for such technological development"	4	4	4	12

Some people claim that computers have made life complex and stressful. On the other hand, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient, because of information accessible through the internet, globalization.
 First of all, Some argue that countless information including private information is opened on the internet even though people want. On the other hand, information and knowledge in the various areas are accessible via the internet. In the past, information was exchanged by letters or face to face meeting. Furthermore, a lot of knowledge was learned from books. However, since the internet has developed in the world, people can easily ask about the recent situation of friends and families. Also, by sharing knowledge in the media, a lot of students can get opportunities for learning. Even though inevitable information can be opened, convenient accessibility of information via the internet give people more interactive relations and educational opportunities. 
 Next, computers have made the world globalized. Through the various interactions with other countries, people can get an interest in other countries' cultures. For example, BTS from South Korea could be famous all over the world since their music videos and performance videos are spread fast through SNS such as Twitter and YouTube. The development of computers made people interact and share their cultures with each other conveniently. As the result, globalization has been proceeding all over the world. 
 In conclusion, the development of computers brings positive effects such as the accessibility of information and globalization. As some say that computers have made life complex, if people struggle to use computers positive, we can solve many problems with computers ."	4	4	4	12

"As the computers being propagated to most of the people from the very first of 21st century, the argument on whether the computers have made our life easier or more complex is rising. Some argue that computers have made life more complex and stressful, yet some others oppose to that opinion. I believe that computers have made our life easier and more convenient for couple of reasons.
; it is available to do complex works, it is easy to record, and it people must follow the development of technology.
    Firstly, the computers have made it available to do complex works that cannot be done by human. Works such as making charts, calculating and solving complex problems, and editing pictures and videos are the complex works that cannot be conducted or too hard to do without computers. For example, nowadays computers calculate the infinite number 'pi' to the tremendous number of digits. Additionally, it is easy to justify this reason even not looking at the history before the computer has been invented. By comparing the capability between the computer of 2000 and 2020, the complex works mentioned above are now done in much less time.
    Second, the computers allows to record everything easily. Before the computers were invented, people needed to record everything by writing on a paper with a pen or by using typing machine and print on a paper right away. In this method, people should have made copies by repeating the same work in order to save the document safely. However, data on the computer do not get ripped, burnt, or wet and vanish. In some cases, the data can be destroyed by some possibilities; the possibilities are situations like light out or error of the computer itself. Nevertheless, using the internet network through computer will help to save the data in the cloud service which is safe from it.
     Even there are advantages of computers such as things mentioned before, some argue that people who didn't learn computer cannot do anything. However, following the flow of technology development is inevitable in modern society: Learning computers are thing that must be done in this society.
    To sum up, computers have made people's life more convenient in the stance of works that can be done with computers and the stability of saving the data. Some might believe that those advantages are useless without learning computers, so it had made life more complex, but it is true that people should learn and follow the development. For these reasons, I think that there are more advantages given by computers than disadvantages."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

    The biggest influence of the computer is changing the spped of our life. The machine, which has overwhelming computing Speed, already takes over human for several works. For exmaple, in the past, to improve the 
productivity, many companys higher engineers to their factory and study for the better proccess; however, nowaday, the super computer and its maching learning algorithms makes much more productivity compare to the human developers. These phenomenon contunes to the decrease of several jobs. In the extreme perspective, people argue that computers and robots will replace every human job. Though there are negative evaluations for the computer, serveral positive effects of the computer also exist; and, it is sufficient to ignore the negative side of the computer. The computer makes two major benefits: generation of the new occupation and scientifical evolution.
    It is obvious that some works are replaced by computer. However, much more occupations, which are realated to the develop of the computer its' applications, will generate and the total number of jobs will increase. In the hictrocal viewpoint, steam engine is the simmilar example. When the steam engine is invented, many laborers oppose to adoption of the machine; however, finally, the machine made a huge amount of improvement on the production and it is called the Second Industrial Evolution nowadays. People who believe the efficincy made a simmliar word, the Fourth Industrial Evolution. The evolution will lead us to equal or more improvment of the productivity, which is highly relative to our life benefits.

    (3rd paragraph, about scientifical evolution)

    In summary, the compter give us industral and scientifical innovations. These benefits will provide us new jobs, new technologies, and new societies. It is obvious that the computer's high performance is essential to the modern society."	1.5	2	3.5	7

"I think young children should spend most of their time playing. I have 3 reasons to support my opinion, first, children who spend their time playing tend to be more creative in their future. When I was young age, I spend most of my time on school studies and advanced math and science. On the other hand, my sister played a lot and had many different interesting things when she was younger age. My sister is now playing cello which she was good at when she was young, and she is more creative than me.

second, children can find their ability and set his/her dream. Few years ago, studying hard and having a job that can be obtained by higher grade at school was the only answer of successful life. However, it is no longer the answer. Recently, there are many jobs that does't need higher grades at school such as math, science, Korean, and is became a succesful job and that talent can be found on younger age.

Third, there is no time to play in teenager age, so that children must play. In Korean education system, teenagers have to study most of their time in daily life. If children don't spend their time to play, then they will not able to have time to play until 20s."	2.5	3	2.5	8

"Childhood is very important for our entire life. It usually determines our personality and the direction of our life. Then what should we do on childhood? Some people think that children should begin their formal education at very early age and spend most of their time on school studies. Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. I think that young children should spend most of their time playing.
    First of all, we all have diffrent talents.  Young children can find their talent when they are playing. For example, a child who could be a great soccer player may find talent when playing soccer. If the child spends most of their time on school studies, then big opportunity will vanish. Most adults do not know what they really like. Some of them work for just money. However when they examine what they really like on childhood,  they can select their job better. 
    The other reason for spending most of  time playing is that  children may burn out. In 21th century, we study until we dead. The wolrd changes so rapidly that we need to adjust ourselves to the world. It means that we need to prepare for learning. If we begin our formal education at very ealry age, then we may be tired on some point. It could be on highschool,  on university, or when we get job.  It makes hard to long run. If children spend most of their time playing, then they may be bored on some point. From that point, they are ready to learn something.
    Therefore  yoong children should spend most of their time playing because of finding their talent and preventing burn out. Nowadays, school education is not the unique way to survive. There are a lot of other things to do. Finding what they really like is the most important thing to live.  So, ejoying childhood is more valuable. One can find it when they are adult. However, If you experience it early, then you can save a lot of time."	3	2.5	3	8.5

Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Young children have to spend most of their time playing. Let me show several reason for that.
First, young children have a large amount of curiosity and energy. They love running to somewhere, touching something new, and hanging with someone. However, they never want to sit down and read a book, or pay attention to their teacher. It is not a good choice for them such that forcing them to go to school and sit down on their 'fixed' seat at a very early age because it will make them depressed.
Second, young children do not know why they have to go to school, why they have to looking a book or teacher in front of them and why they have to learn some strange things. In short, they do not know the reason why they study. At early age, it is better to experience a lot of things which can satisfy their infinite curiosity. Then, they will find the reason why they have to study and go to school.
Lastly, very young childs are usually afraid of being apart from their parents. Even for some children at normal age to go to primary school, it is hard job to being apart form their parents. They need to more time to grow mentally with their parent in their very young age. 
In short, very young children are too active to sit in a class. Also they do not know why they should study and some of them do not want to leave their parent yet. For these reasons, it is better for the young childeren to spend more time playing, rather than going to school at a very early age."	3	2.5	2.5	8

Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I agree that the children should spend most of their time playing. There are 3 reasons. First of all, in whole life, there is very enough time to studying. Especially, if you get old, you may have lot of remaining time to do something. You can study at that time. Also at that time, you can study what you want so you can enjoy studying. However  most of children do not know what they want to know or study. This is second reason. Childern just study something they do not want to know because someone such like parents want they study hard and get a good grade. So they study without their own willingness. It implies that large portion of children do not want to study. In real case, when I was young, most of my friends do not want study. So the memory when they young become bad memories. Everyone knows that memory of young time is very important in whole life because it can affect their job, hobby and even future. So at that time children should do various experiences to make good memory and find their way of life. But only studying can gives only bad memories and bad effects to children. Conversely, playing implies various things so it can give good memories and good effects to them. So they should spend most of their time playing. Last reason is that if you get old you cannot spend time playing even though you want to because of your body condition. Human's body is getting old and old rapidly. So if you get old, your body also get old and finally you cannot do some playing which demands physical requirements. So you should play something when you are young. Those are 3 reasons that yound children should spend most of time playing. Only studying cannot make good adults. It just reduce way of life. 
However, playing can increase the way of life. So I recommend you to make your children spending lot of time playing."	2.5	2	2	6.5

"I stands for the view that ""young children should spend most of their time playing"".  I believe this is true because, children can learn variety of things while playing, which cannot be earned by beginning formal education early. He
To begin with, while playing, children can learn some values that cannot be covered by the formal education. Formal education is quite efficient in teaching  children some selected courses. However, it doesn't cover the important things that are far more valuable in the rest of the life. Some examples of such values can be honesty, sociality, confidence,  etc. One might argue that these values can be taught in formal eduaction also, but I strongly disagree on that point. These values are not learnt by the lecture, but are acquired by the natural context of the experience.    
Last and most importantly, children can find what they are interested in while playing.  Once again, formal education is quite efficient in teaching children some regular courses. However, it does not teach children what specific field to get interested in,  or how to  set a goal.  If  children starts their formal eduaction earlier, some of them may go over and over lectures what they believe as meaningless, without having a actual interest  or goal . I believe this is really dangerous. In the early age, it is very important to experience how to set goals based on their own interest, and pursue them. 
To sum up, comparing to the early start of formal education,  playing is much more valuable in the early ages. Children can learn wider range of things, and also find their interest and set goals while playing.  "	2.5	3	2.5	8

"I agree with children should spend most of their time playing. Formal education can improve intellectual ability of children. However, it teaches stereotyped things, so degrades the creativity.  Creativity creates when someone encounter a variety of things such as listening the music, see the greatness of nature and so on. Formal education does not teach these raw things, but it teaches the processed knowledge. The stereotyped knowledge makes children grow into  a stereotyped person and it degrades children's creativity.
Another reason is related to children's happiness. For example, in Korea, there is a lot of private education when childhood.  Korean students who grew up like this have very high academic performance. On the other hand, Korea has the highest suicide rate among OECD countries. The cause of teenage suicide is mostly academic stress. If children get formal education at an early age, academic competitiveness also increases at earlier time. It would be really unforunate to live this life as a teenager  who can grow up with anything. 
Each child has different talents and has different growth possibilities. Starting formal education at a very early age reduces children's growth potential, creativiy and happiness. For these reasons, I disagree early formal education and agree with the idea of spending more time playing."	3	3	3	9

"In nowadays, technology has been highly developed. Following this, many companies and nations need highly educated people to innovate their techniques. Because of that, many parents want to make their children study more than others  and it causes many arguments. In this writing, I want to mention my opinion about the argument ""Which case is better between child playing and education?"". To simply say, I think former one is better and have two reasons of it. (Young children should spend most of their time playing) 
 The first reason why I thought like that is that playing is one of the way of studying. Studying doesn't mean only reading, writing, solving something. Before learning those, children need to learn how to hang out with their friends and how to communicate and collaborate each other. These learning is originated from playing.
 Second, young children whose age is about 4~7(Korean age) are not ready to go school because they are not matured. If they learn something before maturity, they will take hard time. It leads decline of interest of learning and finally causes to give up to learn difficult things such as math, foreign languages. 
 In child stage, it is much more important to learn social relationship rather than school studies. Even though I agree with some aspect why they are worried about lagging behind, I can definitely say that children should play for preparation their own future."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

"There are a lot of children who start their formal education earlier than optimal age. Most of them study because of their  parent's will. However, young children should spend most of their time playing.
First,  learning at too early age can make adverse effect.  Early education can decrease desire for education. Most of children who takes early education study because their parents want. So, children who take early education can lose their self-learning ability. This means they study because they feel obliged in education, not they want to do. If children lose their interest in education, they would feel exhausted and want to break away from education in the future. 
Education in optimal age is enough. There are a lot of students who get good grades without any early education. Early education can be helpful for getting preliminary knowledge. However, getting good grade or using knowledge for work in future is distinguished from effort  of theirselves. So, early education without children's self-effort would not be effective. If students do their best for education in optimal age, they can make good result and also use their knowledge well in the future.
Time to play gets less as reaching old age. There are a lot of things to do when children become adult. So, early age can be only time to play without any trivial thoughts. Children can get pleasant memory by playing so it would be helpful for formation of self-identity.
In conclusion, children should spend most of their time playing, not on early education. Early education can make some bad effects and education in optimal age is enough. Also, time to paly gets less as reaching old age. I hope that many children can spend their time playing so they can enjoy their early age life."	3	3	3	9

"One of the biggest issue of the Korean parents thesedays is the early-education. Due to the enforcement of them, Korean students usually start being educated very early from about 5 or 6 years old. I guess the purpose of that kind of education is focused on the enterance to the high level university which is believed to be related to the success of life. In order to be the student of S.K.Y. student, individuals need to get highest grade from their highschool. Since the coverage of the sighschool education is vast, becomming the summa cum laude means the whole comprehensions for every subjects with full of knowledge and informations. This cause the requirment of studying the course in highschool before the highschool. Thus to introduce the knowledge of highschool, the middle school coverages should be already understood by him or her and so on and so on. 
Since now, the early-education strategy seems to work some extent, however there are some severe problems with it. First, students do not have the passion to study. Student who has mechanically done with their learning with the press of their parents might easily have the mide opposing the pressure. All the peaple had eagerness for the freedom. Freedom from the pressure of study would not work positively for the personal improvement via studying. Second, students who learned the concept before become less participating student of actual class. This leads to a bad habbit of not listening to person. For instance, In usual Korean highschool, 90% of the students sleeps during the class. It would weaken the deliver of the educational intention.  And lastly, student assumed to be the highest-level university student lose thier dream and waste thier time instead of the hard working to improve themselves or to contribute to the world or society. I have many friends with same problems. They just studied as what their parents said and believed the dream their parents provided. However, experiences they made in university indicates they does not fit in to the major or researcher society. Some of them regret their past times just following the advices and live with liquor and computer games. It is very bad for themselves  and to society both.
For those reasons, I disagree with the early-education."	2.5	2.5	2	7

"I think that young children should spend most of thier time playing for three reasons. First, children should find out what they want to do for playing. Children do not know what they like to do, because they don't have much experience. Kids become to know themselves for playing, such as playing soccer, playing the piano, and watching a movie. If children begin their formal education at a very early age, they are really hard to find their goal. Second, playing helps to develop creativity. Formal education is exactly formal. It is just for basic knowledge, not for creativity. Children could enhance their creativity reading books, playing and so on. Last, playing helps to grow friendship. Generally, children study alone when they do formal educaiton. They don't have much time to spend with their friends. However, they can join with friends natually for playing. Growing friendship is helpful for children's social life. I agree with that kids should play rather than spend most of their time on school studies. Because playing help to know themselves, to enhance creativity, and to grow friendship. A lot of korean parenets believe that begining formal education at a very early age is important to succeed. I wish they become to know that playing is important as much as study for success."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

"I think that the education is very important for young children, but it is not limited as formal educatioin and school studies. Also, creative playing is more important for young children, so I agree with the opinion which young children should most of their time playing.
First, young children does not have enough language skills to learn formal education. Almost class in formal education must need the textbook. However, it may be hard to read the letters on the textbook for very young children. I think young children should more focus on the learning the basic language skills.
Second, young children will may not be work against the homework and study stress. A lot of formal educations, teacher give some homework and test to student. For example, I already do the test now in the advanced writing class. The responsibilities for the class such as participation, homework, and test are required for student. However, these kind of responsibilities are too heavy for young children. Even though it is very stressful for adult. 
Lastly, we can expect the true learning in the creative playing. The knowledge which they learned in formal education is very useful to entering university. However, it is not good for the young children. They should first learn how to think creatively. Playing is very helpful to experience various situations and environment. 
To summarize, it is more important that young children should spend most of their time playing."	3	3	2.5	8.5

"Most of the children begin their education early before enter the school. In Korea, compete with study is too serious. I think this culture is not efficient for children's education. First of all, study in the school is more efficient. Because, when you take the course at the same time in school and academy, school teachers are better than academy teachers. All exam problems are held from the school teachers. Second, it is helpful for growing social relationship by playing with friends when they're young. Children should be familiar with debating, get relationships. Because these behaivors are very important and  dominantly dependent on childhood strategies. For these reasons, I don't agree with the educate at a very early age."	2	2	2.5	6.5

"All children have the potential to develop their own value. Also, young age is perfect time to find this value. So, this moment is very important in their whole life. I think young children can choice what they do, instead follow school formal education. There are some reason to support that.
First, children who play anything they want can develop their own hobby. Many exercise that played at young age is very important. Playing many activities, Children can find something they interest in. Then, they can develop that to their strength. It is hard to be found by formal education.
Second, formal education at early age may cause bad effect for children's education. Very young children who begin formal education can lose interest in study. Young children often resist to dicision of parents. So if parents power children study more at early age, they may not follow that.
Maybe there are some advantages of formal education for early education. But, I worry about its disadvantages. Consider these reasons, more free time to play are given for young children."	2.5	3	2.5	8

"Nowadays, an average  degree of people became higher. Therefore, lots of people study hard to get a good degree. And even young children begin their formal education at a very early age. For this issue, there are two big view: children should begin their formal education at a very early stage, young children should spend most of their time playing. For me, the person who experienced the formal education at a very early age, I agree that young children should spend most of their time playing. There are two specific reasons that support my thought.
 First reason is that the time at a very early age is the only free-time to play without any pressure or stress. As children grow up, they naturally have to study. So,  if young children begin formal study at the early age, they may have to study later on without pressure-free time. Also, playing at the time at a very early age could make people more focus on their study without regreting.
Second, children at early age should experience the world to construct their thoughts and ego. The early stage of human is crucial for constructing their own perspective. And an experience in the early stage cannot be replace with other. So, they need to play and experience various stimuli instead of studying and sitting on a chair. 
 Beginning formal education at a very early age may help children to get better understanding on future studies. However, I think the chance of getting pressure -free time and  getting more experience about the world is more important than that. Therefore, I believe that young children should spend most of their time playing."	3	3	2.5	8.5

Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I think the children should spend most of their time playing. Here are several reasons why I think so.
 First, There is not a lot knowledge that can be educated in childhood. Before the children go to elementary school or the lower grade in elementary school, there is not many thing to educate. They don't educate complex mathematics, science, etc, but they learn the basic attitude, sociability, and basic thinking power. Because they learn the basic thing to leave in society, not a complex things, It is not a thing that only can educate in school. They can learn it when he or she playing with other childrean, and they can learn it from their parents. It doesn't have to be learn from school.

 Second, the children can learn more in real experience. I think sociability and attitude is the first valuable thing to learn in childhood. And that things are different from knowledge like mathematics, their ability can improve from real experience. There is a popular proverb in Korea, 'One real experience is better than a hundred words'. This proverb says the importance of real experience. I think the efficient way to improve children's ability like sociability or attitude, is not spend time in school, but spend that time on playing with friends or communicating with their family.
 Nowadays, there is family that can't spend a lot of time with their children. There is several reasons, like two parents are working, or bad condition of family. Exceptionally, on these case, their children can educate better on school than on home alone. But not the case like mentioned before, I think the time that playing with friends, or communicate with their family is more valuable than spend time on school studies for young children like children before he or she go to elementary school."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

"I belive that young children shoud spend more time with playing. In my opinion, it is more efficient to use time in playing than studying something in very early age.
First of all, the knowledge in very early age isn’t efficient. Young children do not have any background knowledge and thinking skills, formal education will be not helpful to them. Also, knowledge in early age can be fogetten easily more than the knowledge in older age. In my case, I also took some edcations but it wasn’t useful to me and I couldn’t remeber most of them.
Secondly, spending time in playing when they are very young, it can be very positive effect to them. Most of people don’t know what they want to in future. But if children do a lot of experences and activities in their early age, they can get thoughts about what they like, what they want to do. In my experences, I keep dreamed a mechanichal engineer from my early age. It’s because I had a lot of interests in making something, so I made such as rubber band guns, water rockets, and gliders myself in remaining time after school.
Finally, young children have to feel a lot of emtional things. It could be feel like stuck when they have to study all day. It is related to their feelings. Knowledge is also need for chidren, but building their personality is more important to children in ealry age. It determines the entire life.
For these reasons, I think that young children should spend more their time in playing."	2.5	3	2.5	8

"I think young children should spend most of their time playing. This is based on my personal beliefs.
 First, I belive that everyone is borned with special gifts. Some kids are naturally interested in numbers, some are great at being funny. Everyone has something to offer but formal education will never be good enough to take this into consideration. We need to give children the freedom to explore themselves and find their own gifts. We should never force future generation to pursue the virtue of current generation. The world is changing faster than ever.  Basic knowleges are not as valuable as before.
 In the past, the purpose of formal education was to educate the common knowlege even for those who are not lucky enough to get it elsewhere.  However, nowadays it is a system that elicit extreme competition where grades hang like a catter.  Parents do everything to make their kids win the competition. No matter what it takes, how much is costs, they educate their kids to win. I see this as an insult to human dignity. The value of kindness, happiness, courage, creativity is not something given as a result  of a race but something we should always keep. Look at all those tired faces. Our society is ill.
 Maybe, formal education in materialistic society is destined to be like this. We must help children to learn the true values before they start this mad race. If not, they will grow up to be a monster. I believe the most efficient way of doing this is to play. Whatever makes them happy! Communicate with friends. Having silly debates time to time. Traveling with their loved ones. Learning without getting grades. These memories will motivate them to be a better person and will be the most precious resource when they are struggling to be who they are.
 Formal education should start after children already learned the most important things about life. We need people who know themselves, because they are the ones who will make the world a better place."	2.5	2.5	3	8

"Before we start, we need to define  a 'early age'. Because everyone has different standards. I define 'early age' as age under seven. I think that children should begin formal education at least 5 years olds and they should spend most of their time on school studies. 
 First, 'early age' is the most important period of life. There is 'Old habits die hard'. It means it has a high probability that habits at young age maintain forever.  From this saying, we can realize that the formation of habits at an 'early age' is important. If we don't teach several rule or education at 'early age', children can have a hard time to adjust to small society like school. 
 Second, study efficiency is very high at 'early age'. At five to seven age, it is period that the brain develop a lot.  So, if we activate their brain a lot at that period, they can study effectively afterwards.   
 Finally, formal education  doesn't means just strict study. Education can cover up several courses such as play with friends(cooperation or compertition). if goverment manage it at the national level, we can deal with systematic.
 So far, we can check why we have to formal education at least 5 years old. If this system is universally applied, I think that there will be a better future. "	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

"The issue here here is whether young children should spend most of their time on the education or playing. In my opinion, I believe that children should spend more time on playing, and my opinion can be demonstrated by  the reasons addressed below.

    Firstly,  forming relationship and sociality is more important to the children rather than studying knowledges. In other words, it is more significant to children to form the sociality and relationship, such as courtesy and conversation with their buddies, parents, and neighbors to assimilate on the human society. Studying knowledges, such as linguistics and mathematics are sufficient to learn after forming sociality.

    Moreover, the reminiscences that formed in childhood by playing can play the significant role on forming ego formation. That is to say, children can find their personality and bias during playing freely. For instance, children themselves can find what they want and love to do, so that they can learn how to develop their talent by themselves.

    Finally, Parents can also figure out their childrens’ disposition. That observation can help parents to instruct their children more desirable way. Studying the knowledgements could be done after finding the aptitude of childrens. Moreover, parents can set the ambient to enhance their childrens’ talents, for instance, playing violin, soccer, et cetera.

    In conclusion, children should spend more time on playing to form the sociality, ego, and finding the talent. Studying in the school is enough after playing on their childhood."	3	3	2.5	8.5

Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I agree children should start their formal education at a very early age.  There are three reasons.
First of all, children have more chance to learn many things by going a school earlier. Schools give a lot of opportunities to experience marvelous things. They can learn mathematics, but also do experiments which children had not experienced yet. They can exercise with friends. They can explore the nature safely with teacher, and improve their curiousity by taking big experiments. 
Secondly, more younger, they can accept more easily. I think I have accepted new things in more open mind in early ages than in present.  When I saw new things in a child, I tried to make them to my own things, and it has been memoriable. But at present, it is hard for me to accept new things fully than childhood. If I could go back to a very early age, I would do many funny things, and try to learn more. So, I think children need to go a school at a very early age. 
And finally, they could also play with friends in school. In formal education, schools teach interaction with friends to students. Children can learn methods to play with friends in a school. They can learn mathemathics but also interaction with friends in a school.  Teachers do not teach only mathematics. They also think that the relationship with friends or teachers is also important to childrens. So, they teach ethics and exercise to children in school. In my experience, I didn’t get stress about going to a school. It was also funny things for me. School is the place where students can learn many things, and play with friends.
For these three reasons, I think children should go school at a very early age, and they have to learn many things in their formal education."	3	2.5	2.5	8

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Many people think that university students have to attend every lecture.  However, I disagree with the statement and there are several reasons for this. So now I explain the reasons why I think like this.

First, attendance can show conscientiousness. The purposes of universities are not only helping the students learn new knowledge but also giving the right direction and conscientiousness is one of the most important elements for success. So universities need to enhance conscientiousness of students and attendance is the good way to do it. Although some people might think that successful people just have  good intelligence, it is not true. Most successful people who I know are hard-workers. For example, Elon Musk who is CEO of Tesla has worked over 100 hours per week.

Second, attending lectures is also good for the growth of the study. They can meet many professors through participating classes and professors are very good expertise for their study. So they can give not only their knowledge for study but also tips for research. If there are not any rules for attendance, many students will be lazy and lose their chances for the growth of the research.

To sum up, university lectures can advance conscientiousness and students are able to improve their skills for study through the lectures. Therefore,  I strongly argue that students should attend classes. "	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

I think that's because some people, who agree with it think it ,attending the class is right and another group think it is duty. So I will talk about it more with my opinion.

 I think university student should attend to class.  It means that ,as I mention in above, I'm a person who believe attending the class is student's duty. There are two reasons which support my thinking. First, each university has special identity and student should follow it. For example, Kaist has Kaist identity in biology, computer science and so on. So if someone want to be a Kaist biology student, she or he should also have Kaist identity. And for this, atrending the class is not optional but essential. And another reason is that, exam is not only way to test student, but attending is also. Mainly test is regarded to the only way for testing the student. But it is not true. Because ""getting a good score in test"" and ""following and taking the course well"" are not same. Purpose of all course in university is the second one. And for that, attendance check is needed.

 University student must have freedom and right. But also they have duty for the right university student. For that, Because the taking the identity of university and following the course well are duty, I believe that student should attend to class."	3	2.5	2.5	8

Many people think that attending classes should be optional but In my opinion, attending classes is an essential part of the university life. In this essay, I am going to explain why going to classes should be required for all students. 

First, going to classes can encourage self-learning. Many people think that going to classes can decrease one's ability to practice self-learning but according to my experience as a university student, I found out the more I attend classes, the more I get better at self-learning because the moment I go to class, I fully prepare myself to pay a good attention to the lecture and take notes so when I return back home, I can use my notes as a reference that helps me to understand the class much better.

Second, attending classes can strengthen the bonding between professors and students. Could you imagine a successful class without students? No because students help the professor to widen the range of the lecture itself, share their answers with the professor, and sometimes, students may share their experiences so the professor can have a clear idea about his students' personalities.

Third and last, going to university is something moral. ""Respect to be respected"" When you attend your professor's class, you express your own respect to him, and this kind of action is important to every student in the university. 

Finally, I think going to classes has benefits to students more than damages, and in my opinion, it should be always required to attend classes. "	3	3.5	3	9.5
400	University:Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"There are many classes that use attendance as a score, and some of them do not. And this question about attendance is always hot topic for university students and professors, while it is still not concluded. For this question, I think it is professor's selection to make attendance score important or not.

  Actually, there are some of students can get enough information by some lecture notes professors provided, or just studying themselves with books for a test. It is more likely for low level classes, which is about simple information's transmission. There are higher level classes that students can not get enough good grade when they do not attend to the class, even if that class do not have attendance score. And it is more likely for high level classes, which the information delivered in class can not be find in internet or books, since it is about recent knowledge or which some unique skills that can't be learned outside is learned in class. And some classes which needs debate between students in class will literally need students to follow syllabus Students who take these course should consider this, and these classes should force students to attend.

  By these, we can divide classes by their types, about possibility to deliver class's unique information or experience to students or not. Then should we divide all classes like this and make their attendance score bigger or smaller by this? My answer is no. Almost all classes are not only for information's delivery, even some of they are, It is enough meaningful to see that professor's view of  sincerity. By looking the senior experts directly, they can get something more than information. Some professor can think attendance is not important and student's own studying is more important. Some of them can think attendance is important. Professor's view or attendance can be also find in test problems. Some tests only asks about information in books, but others contain problems that can't be solved when students did not pay attention to professor. And, it is student's choice to take specific professor's class or not, and they also can consider professor's view about attendance.

  To conclude in one sentence, there are various classes, various professors and various students. Professor who is evaluator can select attendance needed or not. and Students can select professors. Free interaction between students and professors will eventually find good conclusion about attendance."	3	3	3	9
401	University:Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Some professors think that they must check the attendance of students. Since attendance is mandatory to take a course well. However, in my opinion, attendance in university has to be optional for students. There are some reasons why I think that opinion.

 First of all, university students are adults, thus they can decide their own behaviors. In high school, students may not decide correct behavior since they are not adults. Thus, they have to be checked the attendance to learn more in classes. However, university students should be responsible for what they do. They will choose their own lives, then they will know what they have to do. Actually, the professor from EE201 class did not check the attendance of students and he said this reason why he did not check.

 Second, forcing the attendance will make lower efficiency for studying. University students are so busy with lots of homework, preparing the career and club activities. Thus, they must live efficient lives. If students have homework that its dead line is too close, they will do their homework even in classes. It is very inefficient because they cannot concentrate on both of their homework and the class. 

 In conclusion, going to classes should be optional for students for two reasons. First, they can decide their own lives. Second, forcing the attendance will be inefficient."	3	4	3.5	10.5
402	University:Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"An attendance is the topic that always is talked among university students. Some students say the attendance should be checked in class, and other some say the attendance is unnecessary for university classes. Both of them have rational reason for their claims, and I also agree and understand with both of them. However, I'm agreeing with the attendance is not mandatory a little bit more.

 First of all, an attendance check doesn't consider any environment of all students. Unlike high schools and prior schools, there is a possibility that students live where is a far from the university. This means, some students have to spend more time to come school. For specific example, I'm living in Daejeon, but not in dormitory in KAIST. Before COVID-19 pandemic, going to the class took about 30 minutes, and it was hard to attend a class in a time. In addition, COVID-19's untact situation also made a new problem. Students who couldn't enter Korea and live in their country in different time zone, the attendance check is huge problem. Actually I met a student who have to wake up in 5AM to attend a class.

 Next, the attendance check requires few minutes during the class. During 4 years in KAIST, I experienced some classes' attendance check consume a lot of times, and it leads poor quality of lecture or late in next class. Though this Advanced English Writing class only have about 20 students, but some major classes have more than 200 people in class. In this situation, being optional of attendance must be helpful for both lecturers and students.

 Finally, attending class can be substituted with other methods something like assignments. One of objectives of checking attendance is to encourage students to participate to class and make them study without miss, but these can be checked by other methods. Debating is good option to make students participate, and homework can be also great choice to encourage students study. Thus, there is no reason to check attendance because its objectives can be achieved in other methods.

 With 3 reasons I wrote, I think optional attendance have some advantages than mandatory attendance. The most important reason I think is that all of student must be considered, and schools have to do their best to accomplish equality of students."	3.5	4	4	11.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I think university students should be required to attend class. The reasons are as follows: 

First, I think a good attendance rate basically liked with good sincerity. and it is not strange to evaluate the sincerity to test the student's attitude toward the class. 

Second, attending classes also helps students to a better understanding of the subject. As many students already experienced, understanding the whole major books is very difficult. It is very thick and contains a lot of various content. but in the lecture, professors summarize the whole book so we can learn the important contents first. Therefore, attending a class is basically improves students' understanding of the subject. So, It is not unusual that universities have force students to attend class to improve their understanding. 

Some students said that attending classes is not helpful for them to learn new knowledge efficiently. but considering that the purpose of the university is to teach students, we can get this argument is something wrong. 

Lastly, as I said before, the basic purpose of the university is to help students acquire knowledge. but If students can acquire knowledge without class, I think it means that students do not require a university. Getting good grades by taking the only tests with good scores without attending the classes is basically not match with the purpose of the university, 'teaching' the student. 

So for the above reasons,  I think university students should be required to attend class."	3	3.5	3	9.5

 First university students are very busy. Because they have lectures, social clubs, etc. Therefore, they have to use their time fluidity. However, if the class required participant mandatory students can't use their time fluidity. 

 Second university students are adults. Adults should take their own responsibility. If students don't take the class, then students should accept the result caused by absence from the class.

 Third, attend the class is not the same meaning as study hard. Students can study hard unless the class, for example, some students have good efficiency if they study themselves.

 Students are adults, so they can make decisions by themselevs.

 For these reasons, I agree that class attendance should be optional."	2.5	2.5	3	8

First, the way of studying is depend on person. There are some people who can study well in the class. And also, some people do better when they study on their own. In the latter case, forcibly participating in the class can be a hindrance. Second, forced participation in the class degrade class quality. People who couldn't concentrate on the class often sleep or use their cell phones. In the liberal arts class I took, the professor was angry with such people. This not only causes the atmosphere of the class to droop, but can also cause the slow progress of the class. Based on these reasons, I think that giving the option to attend class will be good for both students and quality of the class."	2.5	3.5	3	9

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"In KAIST some classes check attendance but others not. Some people are curious about why we are required to attend classes and think this should be optional. Others think we should required to attend classes. 

For me I think students are not to be required to attend classes for the following reasons.

  First of all, there are some classes which are summarized a lot and hard to under stand. For these classes it is better to do it by my own. Therefore even though we are attending class, we should use another huge amount of time to deal with class material. For these kind of classes it is better to not attend class and just read text book by own. So going to class by optional will make students to choose better study way for each classes.

  Second, optional class makes class atmosphere better. If all of the students are required to attend class, there will be many students attending class who are not willing to participate but just because it is required. Some of these students will sitting on the back side and just doing other works or just sleeping. So if going to class is optional, students who are willing to participate class will attending class so atmosphere will be improved. 

  Last, making class optional can make university students to better utilizing time. If we are required to attend classes, we should use that time only for that class but if attending class is optional, we can use that time for other purpose and can deal with class material later time. This can make university students to do things flexible. 

  If we make class attendance optional, students can better utilize time, not using time for unbenefitial class and making class atmosphere better. For these reasons, I think for university classes, attending class should be optional."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

First, if we attend the class, we can learn more than self-studying.

We can take the course and can ask some questions about it to professor.  We can also ask other students think.

If students study alone, if they believe wrong things about the class, hard to know about it.

Because of these, attend classes can improve student.

Second, attend class can prevent be students lazy.

If students have to check attendance, they have to wake up early. It means they can use more time than other students.

If they start a day earlier, they can do more work like homework, hobby or study for course

These balance lifestyle also good to students health, so it can help to student's university life.

For these reasons, i think attendance can improve students life positive way, so students should be require to attend classes."	3	3.5	3.5	10

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Some people might say attendance for the class is mandatory to understand all the courses. However, in my opinion, I think it could not be required for students with the following two reasons. First, students could choose their university lives schedule. Next, attending would not be the best solution for a participating course.

     To begin with, there are a lot of activities to do on campus and students could choose depends on their priority. Some could join the stock club, some want to participate in a debating competition. With these activities, they can improve their skills for their social life after graduated. However, if there is no choice to attend the activities because of attendance, they will be the all same students without individuality. For example, I was in an English Speaking course two years ago. At that time schedule, I want to participate in the robot contest for the country scale which all university students come but the professor said if I absent for the course, I would get an F grade. Since there was no chance to choose, I had to give up the contest which could be an interesting portfolio. As a result, in these days, I could not write any specification myself. 

     On top of that, enforced attendance could not the solution for developing concentration for the course. Since university students are adults who have their own ideas, they would even resist for the pressure. Also, they could do any other things in the course such as web surfing with laptops, sleeping. In my friend's case, he was in the chemistry course and computer science course. He hated chemistry extremely but he had to take the course for graduation. On the other hand, he was into programming so he studied computer science out of the course time. Chemistry course's attendace was mandatory while computer science course was not. He was trying to not enjoy the chemistry course and got not a good grades. However, he got A grade for the computer science course. 

     To sum up, required attendance does not make all good results for the freedom for students activities. Moreover, it could not be the best solution for improving students' participation. In this regard, I think the optional class attend is better than forced to attend classes."	3	4	4	11

First, You can learn more detailed and advanced quality. If you don’t come to the class, you’ll miss professor’s additional but intenisve information and useful knowledges which is not written in the textbook or other lecture materials. 

 Second, You can have immediately question to professor during the class about the things you have trouble in understanding. Some people says there are other ways to interact to professor like e-mail even if you are not attend the class, But since you should question to professor by e-mail or other materials and this would take much time. And for some cases, If there exist some points you can’t understand then you can’t proceed to next topic and this would be waste of time

 Finally, You can interact with other students. You can share question or opinions of other students since class would be interactive. Question of classmates is especailly useful because they have similar understanding level about the same topic so you would have more possibility to wonder about the same thing. This would help your study. 

 In summary, attending class is much better since you can interact with professor and other students and also you can take better lecture."	3.5	3	3	9.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" Nowadays there are many types of classes. Some professors want to attend classes and check attendance. However some professors allow students to attend freely. I think there are lots of advantage for taking attendance freely.

 First of all, student should study more efficiently. There might be no time constraints for students. Without time constraints, students can spend their time more freely. They can study lecture whenever they want, and as much as they want. If the student knows some part of lecture already, they can skip that part and invest more time in other lectures. It will bw more efficient if students participate in class when they think they have difficulty.

 Second, students can study in a way that suits for them. Sometimes, professor's teaching stlye may not suit for students. In that case, I think  self-study is more helpful to study. When I was freshman, I attend 'Theoretical linear algebra' lecture. The teaching style of professor was not suit for me, so I couldn't follow the class. So I study my self and I was able to get a good grade. At that time I thought attending the class was a waste of time.

 For these reasons, going to classes should be optional for students. Students can use their time more efficiently. Also, they can study in a way that suits for them. If student study on their own, they might be get a better result."	3.5	3.5	4	11

In my university, almost every classes require students to attend class, but some classes are not. Also, there are students who think attendance is meaningless. I think university students should be required to attend class. There are three reasons.

 First of all, students pay tuition fee, and it is quite expensive. Much of tuition fee is for listening to class of professor. However if students do not attend the class, they are paying for nothing. Not attending class is throw the money on the floor. 

 Secondly, Attending class is helpful to students studying. Becauase the contents of major textbook is hard and very large in quantity, it is hard to study everything alone. With professors help, students are able to know the points of the class and it will reduce the time they study.  Also, It is possible to ask questions to professor directly. It will help the students improve their knowledge. 

 Lastly, attending class is the way to interact with professor. If there is no one attending class, the professor would be lonely and lose motivation to make a better class. And it can be lead to downgrade the quality of class. Attending class and interacting with professor is good for improve class quality, and it also helps share bright energy among students and professors. 

 To sum up, Attending class has many brighter side than not attending class, and it has to be required."	3	3	3	9

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Today many university students think that they do not have to attend classes since they can study their own and some classes are not helpful for them to understand the course. However, I agree with the opinion that university students should be required to attend classes because there are many benefits attending classes.

First of all, attending classes help students to live more diligent. When students have to go to classes, they can have a routine on their lives. For example, they should wake up at 8 am and go to school, take lectures and go back to home. This routine can make students move and help them stay less lazy. School is not the place which only teaches students information, it should lead them to live good lives. So requiring them to attend classes is needed.

And attending classes can give students positive energy to study. When people gather in a class and study together, they see others study hard and this can motivate students to study. Moreover, when many people attend classes, it is more easier to understand lectures and think deeply of the content they are learning by listening to other student's opinion and questions. On the other hand, if only few people attend the class, this positive effect will not appear and passion of students to study may decline. So, to make synergy of students, it is better to require students to attend classes.

To sum up, to make students more diligent and give them energy to study, students should be required to attend classes. These are some positive effects that people cannot have when they are not required attend classes."	4	4	4	12

I disappointed that fact and believe student have to do with following reason.

 First, nothing free in the world. We all know studying something requires lots of energy. 

But you know that? Professor also spend more than yours to deliver well-qualified materials.

Teaching exists and behaved beyond perfect understanding background of your courses. 

Whether you insist class also follows the nowadays innovative thought, job as students are consisted mainly studying anyway. 

Your lack of attention for class decreases not only the activate inter-action with professor but also passion for professors themselves.

Consequently, you cannot study effectively.

 Second, speaking each other is the most powerful messenger for communication. 

Assume, only with touching explain object in front of you. Maybe you are crazying with uncomfortable feeling to deliver your idea.

Although Speaking looks simple, consisted of lot's of mechanism. as you already know or with above example, non-verbal feature of communication cannot neglect.

Attending classes have same analogy. That helps you are concentrating and understanding for material whether you wanted. "	2.5	3	3	8.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"One of my friend always get bad score in attendance. He thinks he do not have to come to class. Sometimes, the reason why he do not comes to class is just because he wanted more sleep. 
Some of students may agree with his points, however I believe students should attend class. It is because of below three reasons. First, it helps to learn more for oneself. Also, it is way to guarantee the quality of class for other students.
Furthermore, it helps to evaluate students' score more fairly. 

First, students can learn more when they attend the class. In university, education is the most important priority value.
When students comes to class, they can interact with other students. Sharing how their perspective is different about one topic. It helps students to 
get broad and flexible point of view. Also students can interact with advisor. Active communication in classroom with advisor, make advisor to know
how students understood the concept of class. Advisor can adjust the difficulty of contents in realtime and provide better quality of class. 
Thus, students get more qualified class and learn more, if they attend to class. 

Second, other students coming class would get disadvantage. If attendance is just an option in class, lots of students would chose not to come class. Class contents is not 
only consist of just advisor's lecture, but also questions and interactions of students. Professors and other students would not get enough 
interactions from each other. Thus, quality of class would be decreased, if attendance is not mandatory. Some said that attendance is optional, because students have right to choose. 
However, it can not be validate, if few student's free choice makes disadvantage to others. 

Finally, attendance is fair evaluation criteria. Students get score about class for their semester. Usually, attendance is important criteria to estimate students' effort on class. 
Attendance can be interpreted as minimum effort and care about the class. If one students did their best on class, but get bad grade on test, attendance score can be 
buffer for them. Because of this, grade could be total evaluation of students' participation, not only just how they get good score in test. Also it is easy to convert in number, so it is
clear and fair in comparison with each other. 

In summary, I believe that students should be required to attend to class, because of three reasons. Students can learn better, when they attend to class. Also if then, other students 
can also get better quality of education. Furthermore, attendance helps to evaluate students in more accurate and fair aspects. "	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Some people prefer to attend classes up to their mind. Because the control of the attendances can be an intrusion of student's privacy. However, my contention is that the university students should attend classes based two reasons.

 First, students have a tendency of having poor control themselves. Students are interested in lots of interesting things except class; computer game, time with their friends and family etc. Especially, the university students can enjoy more unlimited freedom include alcohol. Due to this pleasure, they often fall into temptation. When these feelings get excessive, they can enjoy their spare time even during the classes. Eventually, if these situations are repeated, they will not achieve the goals of the classes they , which makes them deteriorate. To prevent this, participation in class should be made mandatory. Regulating the attendance should help their poor self-control.

 Second, the class includes the difficult things to understand without the explanation. Students who are accustomed to study alone don't want to attend the class because they think studying alone is better than studying through the class. However, the class, especially in the university, contains broad and a variety of contents which can't get alone. Also, the university professor have had a lot of experience, and they can give lots of advice based on their dynamic life related to the class contents. Let me bring up my personal story. In last year, I asked the professor for counseling in class, and he gave me appropriate advice, which is beneficial time to me.

 In conclusion, my assertion is that university students should be required to attend classes. This is because the students have low self-control, and because the class in university is difficult to understand alone."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I believe that students should be required to attend classes. There are several reasons for attending classes. First, students can communicate with professor or TA directly. When we studied the subject such as circuit physics, dynamics and solid mechanics, we can not understand all materials in the book. However, If we go to the classes, we can ask questions to professor more easier than e-mail or message. Therefore, we can absorb the full materials in the book and increase our skills for solving problems. In my case, I am always attend classes for asking questions that I have not realized well, and it is very helpful for achieve good grades. Second, students can cooperate with students who attend same classes. I think that the cooperation is the most efficient way to study the subject. When we studied together, we can have more chance to experience various thought about the problem and interact with each other. This process will improve the students creativity and knowledge. For example, KAIST open the edu 4.0 course to improve the students creativity. Finally, students can live a consistent life style. If we do not have enforcement to attend classes, students will be lazy and ruin their life style. They will awake up for all night, playing the game or drinking will break down not only their life styles but health. It can also lower the achievement of course.

There are lots of debates in this topic, but I believe that attendance is not necessary and should be optional because of these reasons: 

 First, attendance do not fully reflect student's academic accomplishment. In other words, it does not mean that attending every class directly leads students to achieve their academic goal. In the class, some students cannot match with the professor's class style. In my experience, when I was in the freshman physics class, I must participate in the every class. However, I always bothered by the professor's question; I usually like to ask the professor what I want, but not like accepting someone's question that I do not want to know. To improve my physic skill, I stopped to attend the physic class and studied physic from the Internet. Even though I got the poor score in the class, but I can say that I am very good at physics. Therefore, attendance check may not directly connect to student's academic accomplishment.

 Second, it is important for students to study something themselves, which means that attending every class cannot improve student's real academic skill. I believe that Korean high school class is effective to give knowledge for students but not to give creative thinking, one of the important goal for university professor that they have to give for students. However, if students should attend to the every class, it cannot reflect the

There are two reasons for this.
First, a communication between the professor and the students is important. One objective of the university class is a discussion between them, not only a knowledge flow. The discussion has a important role in the class because it can generate more knowledge. Also, the announcements could be done during the class. If the attendance is not mendatory, there could be a weak connection between the professor and the students.
Next, the attendance is a basic respect for the course. In the university, students choose what courses they going to take and make their timetables. Therefore, I think the attendance can show the willing to taking course. Also, it can show the respect to the professor who prepares the classes.
To sum up, I agree with that university students should be required to atted classes because of the communication and showing respect."	2.5	3	3	8.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" I believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Of course there are benefits for attending class,  however, it is not necessary. I want to suggest some reasons.

 First, almost every information is in the textbook and it is sufficient to read and solve exercises. In many classes are consists of summaries for the book. I agree that some professors give intuition for difficult concept or help students to understand complicated theories which is hard to study alone. However, some just read textbooks in the class or the delivery is too bad to listen during one and a half hour. In other case, it is possible that the lecture is nice but the style of lecture is not fit for student. Considering these possibilities, it is helpful for students to attend class optionally.

 Second, students have responsibilities for all disadvantages occur from not attending class. Therefore, if someone who know the advantages for attending and and agree with them, then that one will take class. If someone finds that there is more valuable task that class, then absent and take responsibility for one's behavior.

 For these two reasons, I believe that attending class is not necessary."	2.5	3.5	3	9

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" As university students, we attend many classes about several majors and we can get many experiences and knowledge by experiment, lab sessions and so on. However, most university classes have attendance criteria and we get some penalty for grade when we miss or late for classes. Some people say that university students should be required to attend classes, but others say that attending class should be optional. In my opinion, attending class should be optional and there are several reasons supporting my opinion.

 First of all, university students are all grown-ups, so they have responsibility for their behavior. In case of elementary school, middle school or high school students, they do not have enough responsibility, so forcing them to attending classes is necessary. However, since university students have enough age to have responsibility for their behavior, professor should not force them to attend class. Missing classes is the own fault of student, and we cannot say anything about it because university students have enough ability responsible for that. Attending classes for university student should be optional and professor should not force students to attend classes.

 Next, we can cover the contents of missed classes by self studying with textbooks or searching with websites that can help learning new materials. If we missed the classes, we could cover the contents by self studying with well-written textbooks or many journals. In addition, nowadays, the internet networks are extremely developed, so there are many websites, such as ""Chegg"", that can help us to learn many university-based materials. Self studying might be better for students to understand the study materials, because self studying can lead students to concentrate more.

 To sum up, the attendance criteria for university classes should be removed. I think that the most important thing for university classes is understanding of the contents, not the attendance. Although we did not attend to classes, we can cover them with self studying and university students have responsibility for that."	3	4	4	11

First, when you attend classes, you can interact with professors. I think what we can learn from class is not just knowledges but also interaction with professors and wisdom from professors. I am happy to listen to professor's experience and many lessons. 

Second, we can focus more deeply. In my case, when I study alone, I can't focus on for long time. I often use my smartphone. However, when I took classes, I just listened to professors and I could learn fast and efficiently.

Last, communication with friends is very important. Nowadays, COVID-19 is becoming more and more serious issues. Before that event, we can go to school, join a club and meet many friends. In college, we can highly develop our communcation skills through many clubs or festivals etc,,,,,,,,. However, now we could not meet our friends offline. Attending class is one of a way to communicate with many people.

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"There are some classes select to do not check the attendance in the university. However, as many classes select, I think checking attendance for making students attend is very important. There are two reasons why university students should be required to attend classes. 

  First, if students don't attend the class, it is hard to follow the whole class metarials. Because university classes teach very high-level knowledge, it is hard to take all knowledge about the class on their own studying. In my case, I usually take all classes and focus to understand everything in class. One day, I couldn't attend because I sicked. Although I absent only one day, I couldn't understand the whole class after that day. Thus I have to watch the recorded lecture from that day when I absent again to understand. If I attend every day, I wouldn't have that problem. In fact, attending the class is very important for the student to improve their knowledge. 

  Second, attend to class is important to both the professor and the students for the view of class progress. The majority of lecturers have a format of the lecture that the professor gives information to students. As every student is not the same, it is very important to check the level of students and modify class progress to make students follow the teaching. Professor watches the signals from the students as gestures, nodding, focusing, and answering questions to know how much students are following his lecture. Then they can explain again if most students are not understanding or can skip some easy part that almost all students understand well. However, if going to class become optional for the student, many students will not attend class and the professor can't know how many students are following. For the professor, to modulate the progress, for students, get a very high-quality lecture, the attending to the lecture of students is very important.

  As students have to follow the whole lecture materials and to get a high-quality lecture from the professor by modulating the progress, attending is necessary. Thus university students should be required to attend classes."	4	3.5	4	11.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"In university, a class is one of the most important components. I think students should attend classes. 

 At first, students should communicate with the professor. There can be some students who can get a good score on the exam without listening to the class, but the test is not everything in the class. Professor can say something that doesn't relate to a test but is helpful for students. Also, in the class, we can learn how to listen to the other's talking carefully, keeping time, and many other things. 

 Secondly, we need some reward for faithful students. As I argued in the first reason, a good score is not everything. University should teach some social skills and let the students build good characters. If the attendance becomes optional, it is hard for students to learn faithfulness. 

 Lastly, a university is a school, not a testing institution. Students go to university to learn something. If they already know everything, they don't have to come to the university and the class. Someone can claim like this: ""If students don't attend the class, they can learn nothing. So, it is their responsibility. The university should not force to attend."" However, university has a responsibility to lead all students to learn the class. Attendance is the smallest policy for it.

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" When I look around my friends, quite a few people are annoying to attend class. They wonder about why we should attend the all class and participation must be graded as the score. The main reason about the argument, if we know about the contents about lectures, we don't have to attend the class unconditionally to take a class. Of course, some professors leave student's attendance to their autonomy. Except these examples, in my point, I can't agree with optional attend with lecture. Let's see about several reasons.

 First of all, the purpose of the lecture is not only to convey knowledge. No matter how much student knows about the contents of the class, he or she is obliged to hear what the professor wants to deliver through the lecture. If the purpose is to inform the professor's view based on the contents of the class and recent research trends, I think it is natural for schools to make it mandatory to listen to class. Also, it is as important as understanding the contents of the class in general.

 Next, the participation of students is helpful for the lecture. If course let the optional attendance, of course there will be friends who want to take classes, but the number of students attending the class will decrease. This can make it difficult for professors to orient their class in proper way. That's because they can not examine whether students understand the content in general or not, is there any confusing contents. Therefore, mandatory attendance is required to know the overall progress of the lecture.

 Like the above reasons, university students should be required to attend class. I also argue that although there is burden on attendance it is because I understand that mandatory attendance helps to improve the quality of classes and what to learn through lectures. Thus, I think it is necessary to force attendance as it is now."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

On the other hand, if students don't think that the class they take is useful, then they won't attend. However, they should notice that the person who is responsible for that result of his or her choice is the student himself or herself. For example, during the class, the professor can give hints to students about the exam. In those cases, students who were absent should know that their disadvantages are the result of their absence. Now, let's think about another case. If students decide to attend the class, they should try to participate in the class as much as possible. Participating in the class is the responsibility of their choices. Giving students the chance to choose whether they will attend or not will be meaningful in education. In society, people should choose one of the multiple choices and have the responsibility for it. In the university, students can learn that kind of thing. To sum up, as university students have the right to choose, the attendance in the classes is optional, but they should realize that they have responsibilities for those choices."	2.5	3	3	8.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Many classes have an attendance point and this policy are normally accepted for students. However, in my opinion, requiring to attend class isn't good for students. First of all, student need to know what happen when they did not attend to class. In my case, making an absent makes my quiz score drop and from this fact, I highly motivated for practicing hard. Second, attendance score policy might makes a bad effect for student's free willing. Every student has their own learning rithm and attendance policy might break down this. Every single student has their own plan and we should know that absent is a kind of result of trade-off between class and something, I mean, this is just a result of free willing. For these reason, I think going to class should be optional for students."	2.5	3	2.5	8

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"When I finished to pass the university test, I never study in my time. By that situation, I think people can't study when they have too much free. So, I think the university students should be required to attend classes. Attendance can improve student's participation and improvement. There are some reasons for my argument.

First, attendance can make attitude about study. Making life patterns on own life is very important things for their improvement. Because finding study time that they focus on dramatically improve the quality of thinking. But making these patterns is pretty difficult when there are no schedules. I argue the attendance of classes can be good schedule for these patterns. So when student participate attendance, they can make their own rules for study and it connect to efficiency study.

Next, if student listen to the their favorite topic in the class, it isn't good for their knowledge improvement. When they study only for their good thing, there are no development. So student should participate all of the lecture and make many experiment for their major and expand their think.

Making their own life patterns and Expanding their think through many experiment is important to be good for study and attendance can make these. For these reason, students should be required to attend classes."	3.5	3	3	9.5
428	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Today, almost classes of university check the attendance and include the attendance score in the total score. This is because they think attending classes is very important and someone believe that university students should be required to attend classes. But I think it should be optional for students.
First of all, university is not a required curriculum such as elementary school and we choose go to university or not. So I think university students have the right to choose to attend. Some student can have more important schedule than classes sometime. For example, a job interview or  important contest that overlaps with the class schedule, students should give up them that might be more important to someone.
Second, we can learn lots of things at university beside attending classes. Campus life is pre-social life and it will be valuable experiences for our whole life. I think studying about relationships between friends, seniors and professors can be important than taking all of class. Time at university is limited, then we should spend times with various experience. For example, participating club, competition and festival are also helpful. This is because in the future after graduating university, you will not only study theoretically, but should do various activities such as creation and discussion about content or meetings with others.
Lastly, option to attending classes will be great influence for student. If attending classes should be required, student will feel burdened. Then, student will take a class by duty, and they may not be able to concentrate on the class or lose interest at that subject. Also we can use some lecture note or additional video instead of attending real time class. Then we can use our time efficiently and study the subject we want at any time.
For these reason, I think classes of university should be optional for students. Optional class may be great motivation of studying for some student. Also sometimes, a variety of experiences will help us in our career rather than knowing more about the theoretical things by attending classes."	4	4	4	12
429	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" What is the biggest difference between university and high school? Students take their major class, and they have more free time. However, students still have to take classes in time and some courses give penalty for not attending. I think attending class is not necessary, and shouldn't be required or forced.

 First, there are many other activities to do in university. Group activities for entertainment, research, or hobby need fixed time, and their schedule should be adjusted. However, if there are many classed to attend, then it will be hard to find time for these activities. Also personal tasks or works might need concentrated and continuous time spend, so it will be good to adjust the studying schedule to have continuous studying time for one course.

 Second, disadvantages from not attending class is student's choice.  Professors might give information that can only be learned in class and students might miss if they don't take it. However, the students might think that they can use their time more efficiently by doing other things in class time and want to study the course in other time. Professors won't need to double penalty the student for not attending the class, and not getting information.

 Many courses give penalty for not attending class. However, there are many other things to do outside the classroom in university, and not attending class is student's choice and they can choose to go for class or not base on their opinion even with disadvantage. Courses won't need to penalty them for not attending class."	3.5	3	3	9.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I agree 100 percent that university students should be required to attend class. There are several reasons why I think like that. 
 First, they are students. Students are people who learn and study. To learn and study, you have to attend classes. If they do not want to attend classes, they shouldn't have come to universities in the first place. 
 Also, there are knowledge and skills needed for people who work in certain industries that can be learned in classes in universities. For instance, if you want to be a physician, you need to learn math and physics. If you want to be a biochemist, you need to learn biology, chemistry and also learn to perform some related experiments. Classes in universities provide you knowledge and help you learn new skills needed for what you're going to do in the future.
 Some people might think that since university students are grown-ups, it is free for them to decide if they want to attend classes or not, and it is not necessary to attend classes to get a job. But students are meant to learn and study in classes, and some jobs need some professional knowledge and skills. If you want this job, you have to earn knowledge and skills required for it through classes. 
 Overall, students' duty is to learn and study by attending classes, and classes help you earn knowledge and skills needed for what you will do in the future. Therefore, it is necessary for university students to attend classes."	4	4	4	12

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"In point of my view, I agree with the opinion that classes should be optional for students, for two reasons. 

First, university students may have the ability to manage their study plans. For example, some students can study another weak subject, instead of attending to a certain subject. Or, other students do their personal study in more efficient ways.

Second, students can improve their ability to take responsibility for their activities. If one student has a problem because of not attending class, then he(or she) will get a low score for that test. So, the student's total score will reflect their responsibility.

Because of these reasons, I think It is a good way to allow students to attend class optional."	2	2.5	2.5	7

"Classes in university has some different aspect in contrast of elementary school to high school, which is a 'necessary educations'. Students can choose what they want to learn, and have responsibility of those decisions. Because of this characteristic, a argument about the student's right of un-attendance university class. Some thinks that classes should be optional for them, but others don't. In this paper, I argue the attending classes in university is required for all students.

  Firstly, university is not the goal of life, in terms of learning. Attending class in high school is required for everyone, since we need a proper theory or prerequisites to understand what we learn in university or to live in society. University is also provide a prerequisites for next step. It is obvious that someone wants to become researcher should study things in university before they see a real professional papers. And others, also, the knowledge and strategies which learned in university will help work in lifetime, like give more solutions of problem related to them.  

  Next, only university can provide a chance to interact with professors, a master of his field. I agree that study alone could be nice strategies. It is true that this method is free from regulated, boring syllabus and can choose interesting one to study. But, in other perspectives, this method have a trap inside. Since a university student is similar to beginners, in contrast with professors, they don't know exactly what is a important part of this subject. And syllabus, which is made by professors can give those information. And, professors also have a huge experiences about own subjects, they can give a best answers for questions about what we learned.   

  In conclusion, university students should be required to attend classes. Since classes in university will provide prerequisites or tools to live life more conveniently, and give a best chance to learn these thing; interacting with professor. So, attending class in university could be a best method to learning things about what students want to learn. Also university should make rules to make attend student in classes"	3	3	3	9
433	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"There are many styles of study in schools. Some students like to study alone with their own materials and the others like to study with their friends by making study group. Because the both methods has unique advantages and disadvantages, a debate that finding better approach between them has continued for a long time. In my opinion, although studying alone has some benefits,  studying with their friends is the  better method.
  First, people can be more motivated since they forming a rival relationship with their colleagues. When they start to make a group, they will think that the other people in same group as not only friends but also rivals. In study group, they are stimulated by friends whenever they feel their ability is worse then the colleagues. To remove this kind of feeling, the students will study harder. As a result, it leads better performance than before.
  Next, students can improve their degree of knowledge by answering questions of other students in group. A person who tries to demonstrate some ideas should understand them perfectly to explain them. Students who from study group frequently explain some knowledge to their friends. By this kind of activity, they can know the knowlege perfectly.
  Some people who aruge that learning alone is better try to say the method is more efficient: however, it is not true at all. To understand difficult things, people need more time to think about or someone who can answer for questioin about it. In learning alone situation, students have to spend more time because there are no people to answer for the difficult things. But, in studying with group situation, they can sometimes solve the problems immediately by asking it to group member. Actually, studying with group is more effiecient in this situation.
   To sum up, studying with group is much better method than studing alone. There are reasons that support this ideas. Students are able to be stimulated by group members, have chances to enhance their knowledge, and study faster by solving curious thing by asking them. For this reasons, I will suggest the people who want to study in more efficient way to study with study group."	5	5	4.5	14.5
434	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"When I was young age, there are no choice for me and I should study with my classmates. But now I’m not teenager, I can choose who I want to study with. Studying with my classmates was not bad, but there are some reason I prefer to study alone.
First, I really like friends. Some people think this reason is weird, but it is important to me. When I meet people especially who I care about, it is hard to stop myself talking to them. If I go to study cafe with my friends, probably I will want to know about my friend’s life, what they want, where they went, and who they usually meet. I know myself that I can’t focus on study with my friends.
Second reason is noise. People can get stresses easily when they have to study. Furthermore when people get stresses, they care about lots of things around them. Because of my childhood, I get lots of stresses when I have to do study. And when I study, noises around me makes me more stressful. So If some people is near me when I focus on study, It will make me hard to focus on study.
Finally, for me, home is the most comfortable place to study. Because I can focus deeply when I study at home, I do lots of things in my house, in my room. For this reason, it is hard to bring people to study with me. Many people feel uncomfortable when they go to others’ house. It is good for me and friends that not come my home to study together.
I talk about my specific reasons that I do not prefer to study with a group of students. I just said with my friend, because I get really lots of stresses when meet people who I don’t know. So I do not think about that case. I hope this writing can make chance to understand people like me who prefer to study alone."	3	2.5	3	8.5
435	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I prefer to study with a group of students, rather than study alone. Since, as we are a human, most of other studnets will also prefer study with group. There might be small different point for each students, however most of them have similar habits. In this essay, we will check the reason why most of us prefer the group study in people's basic motivation point of view.

First, group study make students to compete. Think about there are two students are in the same room, studying the math for the test in tomorrow. All students wants to get good score at the test. Also, if there are friends who take same course with me, definitly they want to win from each other. That make the motivate to study more harder than before. In these days, there are some argue that students feel too much stress because of the competition. Unfortunatley, somtimes students suicide because of this stress. However, without competition, still we can't get good result from the test. We should able to control this stress not only our-self but also for others. 

Second is about the cooperation. In the previous paragraph, we talked about the competition but the group study also make the cooperation. Cooperation is very easy and simple. For example, if you can't understand about some thesis or the mathmatical equation, your friend who are very good math can teach you. Or if both of you forgot how to solve the problem, you can cooperate to find what is the correct answer. There are very famous sentence from the Indian that ""When you face very hard problem in your life, cooperate with your collegue to solve it"". People are the specices that grwo up when they cooperate.

Fianlly, it can make different atmosphere compare to study alone. Most of us have to study long time. It could be boring, sleepy, and tired. Students want to take a rest or nap. They usually more prefer to play the computer game or play the soccer at the field. However, if you study with group, they make you to keep sit down and grab the pencil. Also, the situation which you are studying make other studnets to study. These atmosphere make them to concentrate more and easy to jump in to their book. Someone say that group study can cause bad atmosphere easier than good atmosphere. However, since I have a lot of experience for a various kind of group study, more than 90% of case was good. The key point was myself. So we should try to do our best all the time.

To summarize, there are three main reasons why group study is more prefered than studing alone. Group study make students competative, the experience how to cooperate with other people, and to feel the atmosphere from their passion. I also want to say there are several benifit for study alone. It can easy to manage the time, you don't need to consider what clothe wear today. But actually, those are not helpful. Most of benifit from study alone is based on time. But the other side, group study has lot of effective benefit to improve your score. In these reasons, I prefer to study with a group of students."	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5
436	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"slience place.  Some students prefer to study alone, others like to study with a group of students. Some people say the study is the way of  standing alone. They think study alone is the best way to study. However, study with a group of students is much efficient than study alone.

People say study alone save the time because, we don't have to spend time to others. However, study with a group of students save much more time. When we study, there are the problems that we can't understand. If  we study alone, there is no one to ask the problem.  Solving the problem alone takes a lot of time, but if we study with group of students,  some member might know the answer of the problem. Also, we can share the tips during the studying. Asking the problem each other and sharing the tips are very helpful to save time. 

When we study with a group of students, some people think it's hard to focus on the study. They think  group study is one of the playing, and it's hard to concentrate. However it is not true. If  the members have a will of study, group study makes positive effects. A study cafe is the good example of it. When we go to a study cafe, everyone study hard. Also, for some people compare  themselves with others. These mood makes us more concentrate and focus to the study. The number of study cafe is still increasing. This shows people already know the positive effects of group study.

Study with a group is much efficient than study alone. We can save much more time and we can focus to the study hard by studying with a group.   How about make a study group and study with friends? I believe you can get much more  score and fun ."	4	4.5	4	12.5
437	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Why I choose to study alone
 There are many ways to focus on study. Someone uses timer, someone uses blocker app which blocks distracting application and Internet sites, and someone move place to study cafe. There are some people who try to help focusing each other by making study group. I don't think this is solely bad idea, however, I prefer studying alone rather than studying with a group of students because of several reason.
 First, it takes too much time to get familiar with whom study with me. It looks easy, however, I have timid personality which makes me frozen when I try to talk to others. For example, when I started group study about English speaking, I couldn't say English sentences fully because I was too frustrated. It didn't get better until I leave the study group.  Even though it is non-verbal studying group, I am nervous because of thought that other students will see me. It keeps me not to do other things rather than studyng, but it also hinders me to focus on studying. 
 Second, studying group with friendly people is inefficient. It would be better if group members promised not to do any private acts, however, it is not easy. This gets worse if group members are friends, in order to get rid of the effect of my introvert personality. For example, I usually found myself who spent two and half hours just to eat dinner with other members. If I studied alone, I would spend only a half hour for simple meal. Also, we usually said jokes and tricked each other while studing. It is definitely waste of time. 
 Third, studying alone enhances my ability to focus on. Basically, we have a lot of things to focus on in society. Researching, working at company, or designing products are all example that requires focusing. In those cases, you cannot expect any help. You should solve your problem while other people do not care about how you are doing but only care about what you have done.  To prepare all of those works, the ability to focus on with only one's power is required. Studying alone is the best way to enhance your focusing ability since you should do all of the works by your own. 
 To sum up, there are not much advantages to study with other students. I have hard time when group members are not familiar and I waste so much time when group members are friends. Also, studying alone has its own benefit that enhances my focusing ability a lot. Other people might have different idea because they have different personalities and experiences compared to me. Anyway, I would choose studying alone by myself, rather than making studying group. "	4	4.5	4	12.5
438	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Studting alone and group studying are two ways commonly used by students for all kinds of subjects. Both methods has advantages and disadvantages, and every one has his preferance between the two. I personally like group studying more, and I think that it is more affective and less time consuming and help the student to get a better grade. 

     First, group studying gives you and your group a wider point of view on the subject. The wider view helps understanding all the subject and getting all the ideas. The group will share their notes, ideas, and questions, and  this sharing will help all the group members to get the most of the knowladge given in the lectures. In my case, my group members always give me important information that I skipped or did not notice while group studying.  On the other hand, for someone who is studying alone, he will have his notes only and will not share his ideas and questions with his classmates, and that might couse him to misunderstand an idea or skip it. 

     Second, group studying gets you the motivation you need. Personally, I get motivated to study when I have a group, and when I study alone I get distracted and I waist my time on something other than studying. This motivation would help you to study the subject more, and go throu all the question and ideas.  

     Third, having a group to study with means that you will always have someone to ask when you need help. Your group can answer questions you dont know, can explain an idea you do not get, and save you time trying to do it on your own. Studying alone takes alot of time, and there is a chance that you will miss some part of the subject. 

     Fourth, one more benefit of group studying is that you can check your understanding with your group before taking the exam. For example, the group can take a sample exam togather and compare their answer. In this way they can be sure that all the group fully understand the subject and ideas given.  

     Finally, I prefer group studying over studying alone because it gives a wider view on the subject, gets you motivated, group members will help each other, and checking their understanding of the subject before the exam. These benefits can help the students to get better grade, I noticed that I had better grades when I group study for a subject. For these reasons I always recommend student to group study more often, because it can give you a better grade and save you the time you spend studying alone. "	5	5	4	14

Which do you prefer, study alone, or study with a group? Some people like studying alone because there is no restiction. However, I think studying with a group is better than study alone. 

At first, people who think studying alone is better argue that they can schedule study time freely. However, for the person who thinks appointment with the other is more important than appoinment with himself or herself, this may cause bad effect. For that person, he/she will study hard to prepare the group study because he/she thinks the preparing is an appointment with the group members. However, if he/she studies alone, he/she can delay the study time because he/she does not think it is important. Appointment with a group may be forcing him/her to study.Therefore, for the person who thinks he/she have to follow an appointment with the others, studying with a group is more effective way to study.

Furthermore, we can learn more through asking and answering some problems to each other. If you cannot understand some part, you can ask to the other members. If someone know, he/she will explain that part, so you can easily understand it. If there is nobody who knows it, then they will searching to solve the problem. Searching with a group members is more effective than searching it alone, because of the number of searching people. Also, you can learn from the answering the question which is from the other group member. Did you heard that ""we can learn more through teaching to the other""? To answer clearly, and effectively, you should exactly know about the answer. During the explaination, you can summarize and make clear in your brain. So, it could help you to learn deeply.


To sum up, if you think an appointment with the other is important, then studyging with a group may be forcing you to sotudy. Also, you can learn more and deeply through asking and answering the quses"	4.5	4	3.5	12

"other cases, you need to study for some exams. Also, you may want to study that you want to learn more about even there are no exams. At those times, someone likes to study alone and someone likes to study with friends. Which one do you prefer? I like to study alone and in quite environment. Because this makes me more flexible with my schedule and focus on only contents that I study. However, many people like to study in a group with their friends. They argue that it is more helpful to study together. I am going to write some counterarguments they say and refute them with my own reasons. 
 First, people who like to study together say that they can ask questions to each other so it makes them to understand the contents well. However, I think that the environment where they can talk together makes me more distractive. So, eventually, I will not focus on my study well when I am with my friends. Also, if the questions are things that I already know well, that would be just noise for me. When I am alone, I am fully focused on what I am studying and I can ask questions to my teacher or friends later.
 In addition to first, other people say that when they study in a group, it is going to motivate you to study hard. But what if their schedule is so fast or too slow? They are going to have schedule that every people in that study group need to follow. However, if you know too much more than them, or you have no idea what they are talking about, it would be really inefficient and you may be unmotivated even more. When you study on your own, you can adjust your schedule by your self so you don’t need to concern about such problems. You can make your best environment and schedules to study very efficiently. 
 To sum up, studying together is distractive because of its envirionment, and because they need to stick to their own schedule, it is inefficient. However, when you study alone, you can make your own plan that is just right for you and not be distracted by anyone. You can be yourself and calm so that you can fully focus on your things to study. Maybe sometimes studying together would be helpful if you find perfect friends to study with. However, for the most of time, I really prefer and stronly recommend you to study by yourself because it would be much more efficient for you. This will help you to save your time at the end.

"Education programs in these days usually encourage people to discuss their thinking with others. Some professors in KAIST even tell students to study as a group. However, there are still lots of debate about studying with a group is efficient or not. I personally think that studying together eventually enhance performance in perspective of getting knowledge.

Some might said that studying with a group will cause significant decrease of patience. However, there are lots of researches that studying with friends with same goal make the group to accomplish faster than studying alone. It may decrease patience sometimes, but group with aligned purpose will succeed at the end. Also, there are some opposing argument that studying alone is efficient when time is limited. However, studying is not just activity to prepare for single test. We should study forever to develop myself and become better person. Therefore, thinking study as time-attak task is not right. In addition to these couterarguments to the claim that  studying alone is better, there are several reasons why studying as a group is better.

First reason is that studying as a group will eventually make that group to acoomplish goal very concisely. If we study together, we usually have time to test that my knowledge is right. By doing this, we can figure out that we are doing right now. As I said above, study is not time-attack task. We should make castle of knowledge as concrete as possible. Studying with group will help me to get exact knowledge. 

Second reason is that studying as a group will encourage group to overcome some difficult task. If we study some very hard fields, there might be some point that nobody knows how to solve some problem. Then thinking as a group will make me to overcome this. There is word “group intelligence”. This means thinking as a group has more diversity and even more concreteness than thinking as individual. In perspective of getting knowledge, group study will help to find unsolved problem. Even you cannot find solution, experience with different point of view will make your life more flexible than before. 

As I wrote, despite of opposing arugments that studying alone is better, there are quite lots of good reasons that we should study as a group. Human is social animal. We can become top predator of Earth, since we are the animals that can communicate the most complex than others. If we study as a group, we will not only learn about that field concisely, but also learn how to solve hard problem with communication. If we go out to society and work, these will me the most valuable experience. I hope every students in KAIST know this things and help each other to become leader of world."	4.5	4.5	4	13

"Study is one of the most important things to do for all people. However, it is not fun and interesting for anytime despite it is quite important for our life. Therefore, many people suggest various studying type to make more concentration and efficiency. Among them, there are two main types of people either prefer studying alone or together. I think each of them have several persuasive reasons why we have to study alone/together, but I think studying alone is much better. There are three main reasons why I prefer to study alone.
First of all, studying with other people can easily break concentration. Concentration is one of the most important factor for good study efficiency. Some opponent argue that group study also make students to concentrate for their study, but I think it is not. If group members become more friendly, it can easily interrupt concentration for all members in the group. For example, they can go out for eat or just chtter with each others in study time. However, if we study alone, we can completely elimminate these obstacle for study. Then, student can improve their concentration and it will be directly related their grades.
In addition, studying alone have better time efficiency too. Students in usual group study have to prepare their materials to share with their group members. Moreover, they need to devide each part of study and need to prepare presentation. Group members also need to set a proper meeting time and they have to move for meeting place.  These process need much more time than studying alone. Time is very important thing for student, but it is a waste of time. If student study alone, he/she can utilize that free time for more study or break. Student don't have to consider nice visualization of their study and move.
The last supporting reason is study style. As I mentioned before, there are tons of study styles in the world, so each student have different study type with regard to their characteristic and ability. However, if student study together even they have different proper study style, group study could make bad effect to every students in group. For example, if someone prefer to study with discussion and talk but others just want to share their study materials, they can be a obstacle for each others. On the other hand, if student study alone, student do not need to consider others study style. Also, student can try many other kind of study styles in their own time without other's effects. I think it is more helpful for student to find their study style.
In conclusion, I think students can get so many advantages by studying alone. They can make more concentration and save time. Also, student can freely try other changes for study style. Of course, there are more advantages about studying alone, but most important thing for study is motivation. Motivation is much important for student regardless of study style. I hope many students improve their grade with my suggestions."	5	5	3.5	13.5
443	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"What do you think most important things in our life? I think Studying is that. Studying is one of unavoidable problems that you can meet in your life. Therefore, we should know how to improve studiyng efficiency. Then, How can we improve our studying efficiency? In this article, I insist that studying with other people can help you. 
First, If you study with friends, they are able to explain content that you misunderstand. If you misunderstand something, then it takes many time to notice and modify it. Therefore, we have to prevent it before the situation occurs. Studying with friends will help you. If you share your concept that you understand during studying, your friends can inform you if you are in wrong place. That will save your useless time.
Second, If you are in group that is consist with simular level companion with you, then you will want to exceed them. It makes you study with more concentration. If you are in group that has simular level with you, then this group members will become your rival. Good rival inspires you to study more. Because you probably don't want to lose. In result, they will give you more studying efficiency. 
Someone repute this argument by saying that studying with friends distract our focus. Because we can talk each others during study. Actually, that's not true. That is the case of misusing studying together. If you want to improve study efficiency during study,  you have to seperate time, and classfy each time. For example, you should make focus time, and talking time. In focus time, your group has to talk about topic that you study. However, In talking time, your talking doen't have to be entangled in topic that you study. People has limited concentration power. So, this will help you prevent to distract. 
In summary, I said that studying with friends will help you get nice study-efficiency. Because, your friends will inform you if you misunderstand something, and they can become a good rival. In addition, I refuted sentence that studying with friends distract you. Many say that we have to study more than previous era. Because many of concepts were made in this era. Good companion will become good teacher, and good rival. They will improve your result that you will make. I hope you to meet good companion that you can study with."	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5
444	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Many students study. When the exam dates are closer, or there are many assignment, or there are many researches to study, they study. However every people has the unique studying characteristic. One of them is studying alone or with a group of students. Some people prefer to study alone, but some people prefer to study with a group of students. Both characteristics have each advantage and disadvantage, but I prefer to study with a group of students.
 The first reason is that studying with a group of students can let me ask to my friends. If I study alone, when some conetents whtch I don't know is appeared, there are no people who I ask. I can ask to my friends by messengers, but it is not efficient. The communications may not be fast, and if there are some equations, it is hard to express the equations by messengers. Searching on the internet might be helpful to me, but internet shows too many informations. If I search some contents, internet shows every contents related to those. It can help me, but it is hard to find the exact contents which I don't know. It will take a long time. But, if I study with a group of students, I can ask to my friends or discuss about those contents. It may be more efficient than studying alone.
 The second reason is that studying with a group of students can make studying environment. The environment is very important when studying. If the environment is not right to study like PC room, I can't study well. But, if I study with a group of students, it can make the studying environment. Although I can't concentrate on studying, there are my friends around me, so I will try to concentrate again. Also it can motivate my will. However, someone says studying with a group of students can make a bad studying environment. They can talk or play all day long. But, if I just play all day long when I study with a group of students, I will play alone when I study alone. That situation isn't from a group of students.
 To sum up, I prefer to study with a group of students by these reasons. In my experience, I studied well and got a good grade at the exam when I study with a group of students. But, since these are just different to people's characteristics, it is important to find each studying charcterisitc."	4.5	4.5	4	13
445	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"What type of study do you prefer? There are many types of study. Some prefer to study alone, while others prefer to study with friends. There can be many other types. There's no answer to the way you study, but I prefer to study alone among theme. 
 To begin with, let's list the advantages of studying with a group. The biggest advantage is that you can share what you know with your group. If you don't understand something, a friend who know it can be in your group. This interaction whithin the group creats a positive synergy.
 Another advantage is that group study makes studying more fun and interesting. Studying with friends is more fun than studying alone. it can be the motivation for studying.
 But it is both an advantage and a disadvantage. Group studies degrade individual concentration. For example, you may have felt a desire to chat with your friends during a group study. However, if you study alone, there is no interference from others. I recomend you study alone if you are more disturbed by  group studies than the synergy you feel through it.
 Next, the advantage of studying alone is that it is free from schedules. You can study at the time and place you want without caring about others. Let me give you some examples. You can study even in a short period of time, and you can study at home without going out. But, group studies are hard to do. 
 In summary, group studies have the advantages of synergy and fun through sharing, and studying alone has the advantages of concentration and schedules.  I prefer to study alone because I like the advantages of studying alone more. However, it can feel differently from person to person. if you understand the advantages and disadvantages of each study type and choose your own way of studying, you will be able to study more efficiently."	3	3.5	4	10.5
446	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Humans are the animal which are given the wonderful ability, communication. By communicating with each other and memorizing it with writing, drawing, and teaching to someone led civilization, and it made a human different from other creatures. When we are studying, we can utilize this ability and improve our understanding. However, some might say it is better to study alone because leaving oneself alone can make people concentrate more on their work. Actually, that argument is not correct. There are some reasons why studying with a group of students enhance our quality of study.
  First of all, opponent of group study always argue that it harms one's concentration. It could be somehow true, unless you are ready to be willing to study. When you have rigid will to succeed today's work, leaving your friends beside you does totally not matter. Even, it could be helpful because your friend can be a audience who watches you studying. By having a watcher, you feel uncomfortable to take relaxed time. You also can be that position to your collegue, and you both are giving a help to each other. How cooperative it is!
  Additionally, you are not just seeing your friend, but also feeling competitive. Some argue that too much competition can result in destructive outcome. However, positive competition can improve efficiency of our work and give motivation to do better. Getting out of boring circumstance and encounter positive stimulator, exactly your friends, can refresh your mind and 
  Moreover, if you study with your group, you can share your questions and informations with your members. As I already said, communication is the very important ability of humans. By teaching your friends what you know well, you can reorganized the information and stack them more firmly in your brain. Plus, by recieving answers what you don't know well, you can obtain the unknown knowledge so easily. This property of group study is the point many lecturers and instructors are focusing on, which make them try to increase the disscussion part in their classes.
  To sum up, group study can make people concentrate more on their work, cause positive competition, and communicate each other to get some information easily. But, they are the general advantages of group work, so you should not follow them without no consideration. Find your personality to studying, and not be stressful due to your uncomfortable study condition. I hope this writing can give you a chance to consider studying with other people."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
447	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Each person has different way to study. Some students prefer studying with a group of students, while the other students like to study alone. In my case, I prefer to study alone.  These are the reasons why I think like that.
 Before talking about the reasons, let’s talk about the oppose opinion. As you know, if you study alone, it’s hard to ask something to others.  So, according to oppsers, studying without a group can make problems when you face obstacles that you don’t understand yourself. However, there are many ways to solve this problem by studying alone. The Internet is one of it.  By using Google, you can find books, papers, dictionaries and lecture notes about something you don’t know. Also, Youtube can give you lectures related to your obstacles. In addition, there are some sites that you can ask your questions, such as Cheggs. Therefore, the problem that you can't ask something to others is not a problem.
 Now, it’s time to talk about the reasons studying alone is good. Fisrt, you can study whatever you want. When I was second grade in KAIST, I studied with a group of my department’s friends. However, because it was group study, sometimes I had to study something that I wasn’t interested in. On the other hands, when I study alone, I can study anything that I want to know or need to know.  That’s the first reason. 
 Next, if you study alone, nobody disturb you when you are studying. However, when you do a group study, many people would disturb you to concentrate on the study. In my case, when I studied with my group, friends try to talk and play with me rather than just study. I think that if you study with your group, you might have problem like this.
 In conclusion, there are two reasons why I prefer to study alone : can study whatever I want, can study without disturbace from my friends. Furthermore, the problem that you can’t ask something to other can be solved by using the Internet. Then, how about studing alone rather than studyng with a group student? It would be a good choice for you!"	4.5	4.5	4	13
448	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"All students to need study. There are many ways to study contents from lots of sources such as textbooks, online sources, projects and etc. And some people have a contorversy how to study. Some students prefer to study alone while others prefer to study with a group. I prefer to study alone, there are two main reasons for this; I can absorb context with my own index better, and study alone can make me think more creative.
Most important reason why I prefer study alone is to absorb context with my own index better. People who prefer study with a group claim that group of students can share idea better, so it will be more effective. However, this can be accomplished only with the condition that students all know about the topic very well, and can share information. In most of the cases, all students are new at the contents, and they need to know better to talk with other students. Studying alone can figure it out. I make my own structure when I study alone. This can make the contents more organized my brain and I helps me to understand the contents better. This can be accomplished only when I study alone, because I need my own time to think about the contents, and organize it to make my own information which can be used in other situations.Thus, I prefer to study alone which makes me to absorb the contents from the sources better.
Maximizing creativity is another reason to support preferrence to study alone. Some argue that students can study more by checking errors each other. In contrast, this means they can get the answer more easily by it. Thinking more about the topic which can be confused will more helpful at the end. Studying alone can make you more creative by thinking more about the topic. This is because this can make you do anything which is related to the question. I can not the so efficient and be compact to answer it, so it can make it to think beyond the topic which the question is talking. Moreover, this can make me be more creative by connecting more information that I have. For example, when I learn about information theory, I can connect it with circuit theory and artificial intellignece so use information theory in other portions of study, however, when I study with a group, I only can talk about information theory itself to be efficient and find the answer more quickly. Thinking more about the topic makes information to remain more in my brain. Therefore, I can think more creative by studying alone, which is the reason for me to prefer study alone.
To sum up, I can absorb the contents better when I study alone, and also can be creative because this can think me more. These are the reasons why I prefer to study alone. Actually, it is the best way to study with your own way of study. Studying alone can be better for some students, and studying with the group can be better with others. It is your own choice how to study."	4.5	4.5	4	13
449	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Almost every adults prefer their children to study alone. They think studying is remembering some knowledge in textbooks. Also there were many students study in ""study room"" 
which is seperated by small desk for one student. However in these days, many students argue that study with group is more efficient than alone. Many students study in cafe or 
group study room rather than normal personal study room. Although both sides' arguments are tense, studying with group of students is better choice for today's students. 

     First reason for opposing 'group study' is related with old phrase ""many boat worker moves boat to mountain"". It is an old saying that means 'when many people gather, direction 
would be hesitated'.  Many adults are scarying with students to go for wrong direction in studying. However, I think group study has function that students can fix their direction and 
give motivation. Students don't make group randomly. Each studying group has their purpose and direction. Also, group study could stimulate each students for studying hard. 
Studying by group has exact direction and also stimulate students study hard. 

     Second reason for opposing group study is efficiency. Many adults think studying is just remembering textbooks. In the past years, it was right. However, in these days many 
academic areas were changed. Through 2010s, many universities and highschools emphasize the 'variety area thinking'.  As world develop in very fast speed, simple memoring 
becomes useless. Students need to unify many areas and technologies. Along these periodical change, group studying is hot in these days. Many students who are specialist for 
each major or area, can study together and make something new. Group study is needed by pereodic flow of technologies. 

     There are still many opinions which study type is better. However, group study would help students have motivation for studying and it's periodic flow of technologies. Studying 
type is on each students taste. However I suggest students to study with some group members for more enjoyful and efficient studying. "	4.5	4	3.5	12
450	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Why people live together and make society? Because they can seperate their jobs and help each other. There are more benefits in group rather than alone. In other case, such as studying, to study with a gruop of students is more powerful method. There are two kinds of situations, one is similar level and the other is different level of students. There are some benefits in each situation.
If each group member has similar grade, they can cooperate for solving the same task. Another group member who has solved the same problem with yours is better than teacher or smart student. He or she can explain answers in 'your language'. It means the most method you can understand well.
If each gruop member has different grade, they can help each other. In other words, one student can be teacher for other students. It sounds like one student sacrify his or her time, but it's not true. In my case, when I was in high school, I helped my friends to understand mathematics and biology. I could find my weak understanding by explaining.
To sum up, studying with a group of students is better even if they have similar or different grade. To get better grade, you can think other students as rivals. However, they are not only your rivals, but also friends."	3	3.5	3.5	10
451	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"As grades go up, amount of learing is increasing. Studying is requires not only concentration but also various ability like problem soving skill. However, not everone can have this ability. Therefore various studying method have been proposed. Among those methods, Many people discuss about what is helpful when we study alone or group. Some people think that studying alone can help you focus more. However, I think there are more advantage when study with group.
First of all, You can ask your friends what you don't know.  Friends who listen same class with you are the best teachers before competitiors. Each student has different ability so, student has different area of well understanding. Thus, They can fill weakness part of studying each other. According to the curve in obilivision, human can memorize better when they listen same thing  again and again. discussion with friens also make memorizing better.
Next, It motivates each other. Some student is well trained self directed learing. They find their motivation from themselves. However, most of students study in academy not-self studying at home. They must find something  to motivate  from the outside. The best thing in this case is the friends aroud you. If your friends study hard, you also think that you should study hard too. 
Finally, It can be free from excessive stress during the test period. During the test period, Thing to be stressed come from every where. The best thing in this situation is convestation with friends. As they are in a same situation, they can understand and empathize with each other better than anyone else. The most basic thing in poetry studies is the attitude of listening. If you have an attitude of listening at other's eyes level, they will be share their worries. However, there is no need for such thing between friends. Because they already understand because they are in same situation. Therefore, studying with friends can reduce the stress.
This is why I prefer to study as group. It is helpful for our studing, motivation even, It can reduce our stress and make more focus to studying. It will bring more better grade."	4	4.5	3.5	12
452	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"As exam period comes, every place in KAIST such as cafes, librarys are full of students who study hard for exam. I am also the one of them, too. There are numerous types to study. Some students just read and memorize all stuffs, whereas some student write down the contents and share with their friends. There is also different preference  of the number of person study with. Some students prefer to study alone, whereas others prefers to study with a group of students. Personally, I prefer  group study than the study-alone. There are several reasons of the preference: Share the difficulty, be less tired, can concentrated more.


When we study for the exam, there are a lot of problems or concepts that we cannot understand for our own. If you study alone, maybe you will send E-mail to professor or teaching assistent. However, it tooks a lot of time for replying and hard to read because the answer is on text. If you have friends who study near you, you can just ask them and solve the problem. And when your friends asks you the concepts you already knows, you can also help them. Sometimes you will realize you don't know the concept exactly well. This will be helpful to you to know what you don't know yet and understand the concept perfect.  

The study for exam is inevitably the fighting against sleep. Most student sleep less than usual for study. If you study alone, there is no person to wake you up. And the circumstance around you might be very quiet, so maybe you feel more sleepy nad tired. When you are with your friends, they can wake you up when you are sleepy. And If you are not really able to concentrate on study, maybe take  a time of 10-15 minutes for fun with your friends and you can study with healthier mind.

 Some says study with lot of people make you cannot concentrate on study, because the place is too noisy and you will want to talk with your friends. Well, these are partially true, but mostly not. Study with your friends doesn't mean 'noisy'. You can go cafe or study room with your friends. At there, group of student can study as usual. If you have questions or if you cannot really concentrate on study then you can rest just quarter hour. You can study quiet enough with your friend. There is also research result that white noise sometimes more profitable for study. And when you are alone, there is no person when you are wasting your time. Your friends might catch you up just hanging around and make you study agiain. Sharing  study result or study hours also might help for your will for study.

These are three reasons of my preference to study with group of students . I can share the difficulty of studying to ask questions around me, I am less tired when I'm not alone, and I can concentrate more with my friends. There are no correct answers for studying, but it is true that your friends give you happiness and help during the exam period. When you are really depressed, friends might be like a vitamin. With your friends, you can study less harder, simultaneously can make unforgettable memories with them."	4.5	4	4	12.5
453	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I really studied a lot until now. When I was young, to achieve my goals, I should study. Therefore someone would want to study with other people or alone. It will different because the habbit of someone to study is differerent. In my case, I love to study alone. I want to explain that reason.
 I am a student who have a mojor in biology department. To get a good score in biology department, I must memorize many things. When I was a second grade students, my final test range was ppt 1500 pages. It was very terrible. Anyway, I should memorize all of that. There are no other ways. Also, when we took the test, we should solve the problem alone. We can not debate with other students and see the other books or ppts. That is to say, I had to memorize all of things which I learned in my self. So, there are no reasons to study with other students. A group of students could not help me. To memorize all of things, I should study alone and fine the best way to memorize alone.
 Second, studying with a group of students interfere me. During the test period. My pattern changed enormously. Every day I slept only four hours a day and the time to sleep was changed. Therefore, sometimes I had a lunch at 3pm and I had a dinner at 4am. I guess the reason that my pattern was changed is that I focused on the study, I didn't have the time to take a dinner or lunch. However, if I studied with a group of students, I would take a lunch with that students and I would lost the chance that I could concentrate well. Also, if I studied with group of students, I would chat with those students. It is not helpful to me.
 I tried many ways to memorize all of things which I learned. Sometimes, I studied with my friends. But it never helped me, it interfered my study and take away my time. In the past, some friends asked me that study with my friends and take questions each other. It could be helpful if I checked the things that I memorized. However, there are too many things I should memorize. Studying alone is the best way and efficient method to me."	4.5	4.5	4	13
454	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Studying is a hard task. Putting unfamiliar things to our brain is hard and painful to everyone. To help this process, people ask help to others or study with others. However, I think studying alone is more benficial to me.
First, studying increases my skill and knowledge better than the case of studying with a group of students. Some might say that if we study together, each others can help things that they do not know and make a synergy. However, those knowledges which are from peer groups are easily earned knowledges. The response to the question is immediate, and we can get the answer without an effort. If we study alone, new knowledges are usually earned with difficulty. We have to find internet, encyclopedia, and books to find a new information. Through this process, skills to find a new knowledge get improved. Additionaly, knowlledges which are earned with difficulty are hard to be forgotten.
Next, studying with others is harmful for my concentration. With friends, there are so many chances to stop studying. They can always suggest to go out for a movie or beer while studying. Studying requires a high level concentration quite often, and friends are usually harmful to the concentration. People who prefer to study with others can say that studying with hard working friends will not harm their concentration. Even if everyone work hard, they all have a limit on their concentration, so at least one person in group is unconcentrated with high probability. As lose of concentration can be spread to others, studying with groups have higher chances to lose the concentration.
Since studying is the major job of student, finding a good studying environment for individuals is important. I prefer studying alone, becasue studying alone increases my skill and knowledge, and studying with others is harmful for my concentration. I hope that everyone can find their own optimal studying environment and study hard all the time."	4.5	4.5	4	13

"The way of people study is all different. Some people like to study alone, while others like to study together. I prefer to study with a group of students in three reasons, and I will explain why.

First, if I study with friends who are taking the same class, I can ask questions to my friend and can see what I don't know. while I'm studying alone, I can't solve my curiousity right away. I should memorize what I don't know and ask questions to my friends or professor later. Also I should go without knowing to the next step. However, while I'm studying with a group, I can solve questions emmidiately and go to the next step smoothly.

Next reason that I prefer to study with a group of students is concentration. I can concentrate on my study whlie I'm studying alone. However, if I study with a group, concentraion on my study becomes higher. There are so many  distractions such as cellphone, game, SNS, etc. Studying alone is hard to shake off obstacles, but it is possible if I study together. Once, I made a rule to play at a certaion time with the people I studied with, therefore I was able to concentrate on studying.

Lastly, if I study together, I can cheer up when studying is hard. Sometimes I want to give up because the subject I study is so difficult. Or there are times when I feel anxious because I don't have enough time to study. If I have a friends who studies with me, I am able to study with strength without give up.

To sum up, I prefer to study with a group of students because of three reasons. I hope you find a way to study well and study hard."	3.5	4.5	4	12
456	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"If you want to do something, it is important to know how to do that. In order to accomplish what you want, you need to study and develop yourself. There are two ways to study. One is studying alone and the other is studying with a group members. Each method has disadvantages and advantages, so there is no right answer.  It may depend on your personalities. Although some students prefer to study alone, I prefer to study with a group members.

    First of All, studying alone can allure you not to fully concentrate on studying. There are no other people to prohibit you from the temptation. If the learning materials are so difficult, then I strongly want to do other things when I study alone. I usually watch youtube and playing games. However these are not actually taking a rest and these are easy to be addicted. The most important point is that these things that are not related to studying waste a lot of time. On the other hand, when we study with a group members, we have the group schedule for studying. Thus, we try not to broke the rule. In addition, one of the group member may prevent me doing other things. Thus, studying with a group members prohibit me not doing other things.

    Next, some students who prefer study alone insist that they can manage their own tempo of studying. However, studying together has a more essential benefit which is helping each other with discussion. When I study mathematics, there are a lot of sophisticated concepts. If I can not understand these concepts by reading a book or googling, it took a lot of hours or days. Actually, these struggling time is valuable for mathematicians. However it is not an efficient since we are at the learning level. Despite taking a lot of time, we can solve it easily by disccusion with group members who study together. During the disccusion, we can know what we know and what we do not know. Moreover, this enhance our understanding of the problem. Moreover, I can aid other group members. Therefore, studying with a group members saves a lot of time and efforts.

    In conclusion,  studying with a group members stop me not doing other things and it is more efficient. Although studying type depends on one's personality, I recommend you to study together. you will have a great accomplishment when you and your group members solve a problem that you can not solve alone. I think that group intelligence is greater than individual intelligence."	4	4	4	12

"For students, studying  with a group has been controversial. All students have different view on studying together or alone. Some of them feel that studying alone is better; however, others feel that studying  with a group is more helpful. Those who are in favor of studying alone believe that with a group, the students are likely to talk together rather than study together. In addition, they worry about the difference of abilities each has. Furthermore, they argue that it is more comfortable when you have a break time alone. Although there are quite plausible reasons to studying alone, I believe that studying with a group is better for other several reasons.
First of all, many have stated that people usually want to talk or play if they gather. Once one student strat to talk to someone, then all together join the talk. They say it leads to not to study. It may seem reasonable, but they missed an important point. The group are constituted by people who want to study hard. Therefore, there can be some talk with each other but it will not last for a long time. If the talk keeps continuously, somebody will ask to stop it. Since they are willing to study hard, it is not a critical problem.
In addition to first, others assert that all the group members have different speed to study. They believe that this hinders for the members to study well; in fact, it is not true. According to a study by Seoul National Universtiy, it was found that students who studied with a group tend to show high performances than other students who studied alone. The tendency is verified numerically in the study; the students who studied with a group showed an increase of 33% in their scores, while the students who studied alon showed an increase of 14% in their scores. This result clearly support the fact that studying with a group is better than studying alone.
The last argument of those who trust that studying alone is better is that students feel stable when they rest alone in the break time. They insist that being together can be a stress for someone. If just feeling stable in the break time were the only concern, they might be correct. From a different point of view, however, it is not desirable. For example, if you are really tired because of the long-time studying and want talk to someone your difficulties, there should be someone talk with you. If you are alone, however, you cannot talk anyone and feel lonely. It will affect bad for your study.
To sum up, it is better to studying with a group than studying alone. First, you can study hard because the all group members are willing to study hard. Secondly, the study by Seoul National University verified that the effect of studying with a group is much better. Furthermore, if you study with somebody, you can enjoy your break time and study harder again. How about studying with a group if you want to expect to get higer performance?"	4	4.5	4	12.5
458	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Some students prefer to study alone but the others do not. Why this happen? It is because there are not only advantages but also weaknesses. However, I prefer to study with others because I think that advantages are stronger than weaknesses. Morevoer, advantages can cover weaknesses. From now  on, I will tell you why I  think like that and rebut opposite arguments.

 Firstly, there is opposite argument such that studying alone is more efficient than studying together because when you study alone, you can stduy the only part that you want. Moreover, when you finish understanding some parts, then you can pass and study other parts. It is their opinion. However, I think studying together is more efficient because if there are some parts that you cannot understand, then you have to spend a lot of time and effort. In this situation other students can help you understanding by explaining their thoughts. Therefore, you can easily pass that part. In my case, when I study some difficult topic about AI and there is no improvement of studying because it is too hard. However, after my friends give me some advise, I realize my mistake that I misunderstand definition and finally I can pass that part. If he did not help me, I would give up.

 Next,  there is opposite argument such that studying together needs a lot of resources such as time and effort of relationship. However, I think it can also be the big advantages. Firstly, for time, it is because you can use time with concentration. When you study with you friends, you have to do your work on time. It makes you not waste the time. Moreover, for the effort of relation ship, it can be difficult to make a good relationship. Although it can be stressful to make a relationship, you can make a friend and they can help you when you need. Also, they can help your studying. I think those are great advantages. I also ask something to my friend who become friendly after doing the group coursework together.

 To sum up, there are some advantages and disadvantages. I think there are more advantages than disadvantages. Moreover, I think working together not only for studying but also other things is worthy even if there are some difficulities such as time or effort of making good relationship. After you work together, you can realize that. Let's study together!"	4	3.5	4	11.5
459	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Nowadays, more and more courses in university teach students to study in group. There are somes students who prefer to study alone, and not in a group. They think that studying together would reduce the speed of studying. They also believe that most of the students they study with would stop studying in the middle of the process, which would  affect them. Lastly, They also belive that if they study together in a group, they would not learn things in depth. Altough these reasons may seem quite fair in first glance, I belive that these reasons contains some logical errors, which is why I think that studying with a group of students is much better than studying alone.

Firstly, One of the reasons that some students prefer to study alone is that they think studying in a group is much more slower. However, I think this is not true. Studying in a group can enhance the overall speed of learning. If we are studying alone, we cannot get help from anyone even when we are stuck. In contrast, if we study with the group of students, group members can help each other to move on, by sharing the understanting. For this reason, I think that studying together can be much more faster than studying alone.

Secondly, some students fear group studying because other students in group may stop learning in the middle stage. They believe this could affect them, as well. However, I believe this is absolutely false. Recent statistics show that students who study alone has twice more likely to stop learning in the middle of the process. This phenomenon can be explained by the ""collaborative work effect"". Collaborative work effect is the effect that people tend to work harder if there are co-workers who work on the samething. Co-workers would motivate each other while working, which makes less failure within the group. Likewise, studying in a group would make students study until the end. 

Last, and most importantly, some students may think that if they study with a group of students, they would not learn things in depth. They believe this is true because they cannot set the speed of learning in their own; even if they want to stop a while and ponder on something.  However, this is not true because group of students can always teach each other in depth. If we want to understand some concept in depth, we may just ask ""I want to know this concept in depth."" to the group members. Now, compare to the process of studying alone, we can always get a great help from our group members. As you can see, studying together in a group can definitely help to study in depth compare to studying alone.   

To sum up, I believe that studing in a group is  much more effective than studying alone. Studying with group of students may enhance the overall speed of learing. It may also help students to finish studying until the end,  and accomplish the goal. Finally, students can teach their group members so they can learn in depth compare to studying alone.  Next time if you have to study something, you may make a study group to study together, which will be a great help!"	4.5	4	4.5	13

" When we do our homeworks, sometimes we encounter insoluble problems. At this time, if we have friends who understand well about that problems, we can get help of them. Some people are worried about inefficiency and degrading concentration. However, I prefer study with a group of students because we can cooperate, and ask and answer with a group of students.
 So far, Some people argue that study with others cannot fill in shortcomings of students. However,  study with group members can supplement weakness by cooperation. Each of us has a different field of confidence. For example, Someone is strong in math, but weak in physics. Therefore, if we become teachers for subjects that we are not confident about, we can fill in our shortcomings.
 Others argue that, study with others decreases the learning efficiency. However, It is only 5~10% learning efficiency, if we read only textbook. With discussion or ask and answer, It improves efficiency up to 90%.
 To sum up, we can improve the learning efficiency by discussion and becoming others teacher. If you do not want to meet group members face-to-face because of the COVID-19, I recommend an online group study with Zoom!"	3.5	4	4	11.5

"Studying and getting good grades in test are the most common way to success. To improve their lives, every students studies hard. But, there is a difference in the way of studying. Some students likes to study alone, meanwhile others prefer to study with a group. Despite of the argument, I believe that studying with group is better way.

 The first reasons why some students prefer to study alone is that they can concentrate on studying. They might say ""if we study in a group, we can't concentrate on reading books and it leads us to mass up."" But, focusing on studying alone is not the best way. Rather than that, making a group and teaching someone will increase your understanding. Understanding is totally different with teaching. Even though you understand all things and can solve any problems, you might not teach the knowledge. To teach someone, students should know all principle and can interpret the knowledge with your own words. In this process, you might find what you missed or more developed knowledge. The way of teaching can be only worked when you study in a group.

 In addition to the first reason, group studying students can get another advantage, 'Fun'. Study alone is boring. People who study alone can just read books, and watch lecture. It is the fastest path to go sleep. However, if you study with group, you can do it with fun. You can ask something to your friends or do quiz to check your understanding. Studying with group makes the way of studying broad.

 Last, studying with group is helpful to your future work. Almost jobs need to co-work with colleagues. If you had studied alone, you may ruined co-working. By group studying, you can practice your future job.

 There is no perfect way of studying. You can study alone if you want to do. But, if you don't have any unique way of studying, I suggest you to study with your friends, because of benefits such as teaching and learning systems, fun studying, and your future. Please notice that effects of group studying come from when you do hard work. Then, you will get success in your exam.  "	4	4	4	12
462	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"There are a lot of people who study hard. Some people say that studying alone is the best way to study. Others say that studying with other students is better than studying alone. In my opinion, studying with a group of students is better than studying alone.
First of all, some people say that in case of studying with a group of students, students would spend time to talk with others. However, students can study efficiently through studying with other students. The reason of the efficiency is that students can share opinions with others. Assume that someone doesn't know about something that he or she is studying. If he or she studies alone, he or she should find it in the textbook or should search it on the Internet. On the other hand, if he or she is studying with his or her group members,  they can know about it immediately by sharing ideas. Because of this, students who study with others can spend less time than students who study alone. 
Second, there are some people who believe that students who study alone can concentrate fully on studying something. However, students who study with their group members can concentrate better on studying something. This is because of the atmosphere to study. When someone is studying, the environment affects him or her a lot. If students study with others, they cannot do other things like playing games because other students are study hard around them. Therefore, group study can increase the concentration of the students.
Finally, some people argue that students should not study with friends when they are studying. However, studying with other students can make close friendship with them. One of the most important purposes which the education has is the friendship of students. However, if students do not study with others, they would find other ways to make friends. On the other hand, students who study with their group members can easily get closed with them. 
In conclusion, studying with group members is the better way to study than studying alone. Some people argue that studying alone is better than studying with a group of students. However, group study have higher efficiency, higher concentration. In addition, students can have close relationship between other students by studying with them. I hope that students can study efficiently by studying with a group of students."	4.5	4	4	12.5

"“There is no right way in studying.” This is a famous saying which every student in Korea should have been told at least once. Likewise the saying, each student has different style of study. We can divide the students roughly in two groups: who like to study alone, and who like to study within friends. Among them, students who study alone claim that they can understand deeply while taking time to catch concepts, and they can use their time more efficiently. However, this essay asserts that studying with a group of students is better way to learn something.

Firstly, students who prefer studying alone claim  that they need time to understand concepts with times to think themselves, and after that, they could reach to the fundamentals of the concepts. However, this is inefficient way to understand something. One person cannot fully understand whole thing about what he or she learns. It is because each student has each one’s point of veiw or frame to the world, and we can miunderstand what the instuctional document says. Additionally, it will take long time to understand totally new concept for the beginner. By studying with others, we can cover thes defacts. If several students share their understanding about one concept, they could see varying aspects of the idea and it would lead to their deep understanding. Thus, when the students share their understanding, they talk about it, they listen about it, and they write about it addition to just reading it. It helps we repeat the contents what we are learning and understand well. 

Secondly, students who study alone argue that they can manage their time in the way they want and it is the most efficient way to study. When the students enter the university, they encounter may enjoyable things such as video games, movies, and beds we can sleep. They have freedom with their behavior, and easily want to be comfortable with those things especially when we are alone. However if we are with friends who have same goal, to understand a certain concept, we cannot do other things. We can more focus on the concept without thinking other peripheral things.

"During the exam period, KAIST students study according to their own study style. Some students study alone in the dormitory or library, and another students study together in a classroom. Some people say that studying with a group of students can cause you to lose concentration and interfere. However, this should not be seen as a problem.  Rather, group studying helps to improve study efficiency.

Until now, many have argued that people become nosiy when they study together. If you study alone, you just blank out of a while.  However, you can waste all your time for chatting when you study with your friends. Maybe, but when you're with the friends, you could save time to waste. For example, when studying alone, there is no one watching, so you keep looking at your cell phone. On the other hand, if you study with a group, another friend can give you a warning whenever you don't concentrate on studying.

There is an advantage when you study with a group of students.  It is easy to solve your curiosity  if you study together. When you are alone, you can solve the problem through only the internet. Or, you have to ask someone else later, so it's hard to solve the curiosity right away. However, you can have a discussion about the problem when you study with your friends. Also, there might be a student who has the same question as you. Or, you may already have a friend who knows the answer to the question. You can share your knowledge with each other and study more deeply.

To sum up, study efficiency is increasing when you study with a group of students. First, you can concentrate on studying  because your frends can give a caution. Also, you can study more deeply for a discussion with your study members. What about study with your friends? You can get higher score for your test."	4	4	4.5	12.5

"Many students are studying hard for success and getting nice jobs. Sometimes, we hate the studying because it is so boring and difficult. According to statistics from Nelson, 88% of Korean high school students have experienced the feeling of stop studying during exam period. Accordingly, we should consider most effective way to study and concentrate for learning. Although some argue that they prefer to study alone, I believe that studying with a group is the better choice.

First of all, many have argued that the surrounding study environment of students should be quite for concentrating. They believe that just quite condition is the best for students. However, according to research, some noise is helpful to concentrating on something(Choi). For example, many students find the cafe because they can feel more comfortable in the condition of enough noise. If you study with your friends, you can talk with them in the rest time, so it may encourage you for keep studying. 

Next, some argue that students will not study because they just chat with each other. However, there are several benefit of group studying that overcome the risk of chatting each other. The group member may be able to help you to solve the assignment. For example, in the case of KAIST, the assignment problems are usually difficult, and many students may not solve them alone. If you study with your department friends, they can share the solutions or ideas, and they will solve the problems together. Also, according to research, students who study with a group make more advanced and creative solution for social problem(Bai). Therefore, we can expect the great effect of group study.

In conclusion, I think that studying with a group is more effective for students. If you meet your friends and study together, you can also learn the social relationship. You will discuss, share the idea, and make decision with agreement of all group member.

"When we study, we have to choose one of the methodology that study alone or together with other students. There are many trade-off using each methods. Studying with other friends can improve the efficiency of study, exciting. Nevertheless, I prefer to study alone rather than group study. I have several reasons and examples in this opinion.

 First of all, some of guys said that studying each other is helpful for efficiency. They argue that when problems occur during study, they can discuss and evaluate each other. But I think it is not for everyone. In my case, group study was not efficient for me. When I was a junior, I studied Engineering math with my friend. We also helped each other, but we discussed the problems based on uncertainty. It caused the failure of that class. I think all students are not the expert of specific subjects, It would be better study alone and discuss with professors or teaching assistants rather than friends. I got A+ after that semester. In that reason, I studied alone and discussed with professors.

  Second, some of students argued that group study is exciting. When they feel boring while studying with others, it's good opportunity to play and rest. Although rest while studying is important, I think it's not a proper way that studying each other. In my experience,  I studied with my girlfriend for all exam durations. When she wanted to rest and play, I also rest with her even though I'm not ready to finish my work. And vice versa. It was very unefficienct for study, we finally got the lowest grades. After that semester, we studied seperately during the exam weekend. We could fully focus on own study and rest.

"What is a most important duty of students? Obiously, that is a study. Every student do their study by own ways. There are so many strategies to achieve a knowledge and learn something such as studying alone or studying with a group of students. However, I prefer to study with a group of students. There are some advantages than alone.
First of all, students with other students can study efficiently. They can divide a textbook with several chapters, take each parts for explanation to others.Using this strategy, each student can study only small parts of the textbook. So, they have a less stress from amounts of exam range. In fact, I often used this way with my friend. Then, I got a good grade of some biological classes. Because students who study together can save the time to prepare exam, studying together is a efficient study style.
Next, some students who prefer to study alone say that students prevent each other from concentration to study. However, I do not think so. In my case, students who study with others can check each others whether they think of only study or not. Then, it is able to make good mood for study. Therefore, making the group is good way to concentrate with study.
To sum up, there are some advantages of studying together such as efficient learning, help concentrate. Of course, that is not perfect strategy for every students. However, I have recieved some benefits by using a group-studying. Therefore, I strongly command this study style and hope many students will get good grade."	4	4	4	12

"Everybody has their own way of studying. Some people prefer to study alone while other people prefer to study with a group of students. Students who prefer the group studing say they can be motivated by their group members and can use a large seminar room. Despite these advantages, I prefer to study alone for some reasons.
 First,  students who prefer a group studying think that the group members can motivate them to study hard. It is partially true, but I think it doesn't make sense for all cases. It is because this also means we can be easily unmotivated by other group members. For example, other group member might tell us to go out while we are studying. Moreover, when we study with others, it is easy to be disturbed by their noise. In addition, to study with a group of students, we should meet at specific time. However, the group members are not always available, so  it is hard to meet to study together. Therefore, we cannot use our time fluently. However, in case of studying alone, we can concentrate our own work without disturbance and can use our time more fluently. 
 Second, some people prefer to study with a group of students since they can use the school seminar room which needs 4 people to make reservation. However, this also means that it is hard for group to find a suitable studying place. In fact, it is hard to seat together with a group in library. In many cases, they have to be split. Or, they have to move another place to have a seat. In other words, studying with a group of students have some space limitation. However, when we study alone, we don't need to worry about to get a seat in library. It is more easier to get one seat in library.
 In conclusion, for me, studying alone is better than studying with a group of students. It is because studying alone allow us to study without interrupt with others. In addition, studying alone make us to use our time more efficiently and has less space limitation compare with studying with a group. "	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

" There is so many style that people study. Some students prefer to study alone, others prefer to study with his friends. Some students prefer to study in place that is very quite like library, othres prefer to study in place that is noisy like cafe. There is so many style that people study, and we have to choose our own style that is most efficiency. Among them, I prefer to study alone. I'll mention why I prefer to study alone.
 First, Studying with a group of students is unefficient for me. I have active characteristic. So, when I study with my friends, I spend the most of time to talking with my friends. I really like talking with my friends. so when I study with my friends, I spend 3 minutes of a hour to study and 57 minutes of a hour to talk my stories that is funny to my friends. It is unefficiency way to study hard. But when I study alone, there is anyone that I can talk my story, so I spend most of time to studying hard. So, Studying alone is efficiency way to study for me.
 Moreover, Studying with a group of students is not necessary for me. I only ask questions to teaching assistants or professor, so studying with a group of friends is not necessary for me. The advantage of studying with a group of students is that we can ask questions to each others. But, I can't believe the answer that my friends answerd is correct. So, I only ask questions to teaching assistants or professor because I want to get a exact answer. So, studying with a group of students is not necessary to me.
 Finally, I can study with great feeling when I study alone. I like to sing songs when I am studying. When I sing songs, I feel great and happy. So, I can study hard with happy feeling when I sing songs during I am studying. It is also help to refresh my brain. However, when I study with a group of students, I can't sing songs during I'm studying. Because It is good for my feeling, but It is terrible for their feeling who study with me. So, I prefer to study alone to sing songs during I am studying.
 In conclusion, I prefer more studying alone than studying with a group of students. There is three reasons. Studying with a group of students is unefficient for me due to my active characteristic, Studying with a group of students is not necessary for me because I never ask questions to other people except teaching assistants or professor, and Studying alone is good for my feeling because I can sing songs during I am studying.

"Studying methods are very various, and each students have their own methods. Some students prefer to study alone because they can concetrate more, they do not want to talking with their friends, and they don’t want to share their materials. However, I prefer to study with a group of students and I’d like to explain the reasons why I prefer to study alone.
        Others say that they prefer to study alone because they can concentrate with their study.  In my case, I can concentrate more when I stduy with a group of students. If I stduy alone, I feel like ‘I can do anything else except study.’ It leads decreasing my concentration, watching some videos, and playing games.
        Some students argut that if you study with your friends, you will talk with them, and it will bother studying. However, it is not true. Actually, you can control talking with your freinds if you have passion to study. Also, it will be more helpful if you study with your friends. You can ask some contents that you cannot understand to your friends immediately.  You can discuss creative ideas or thoughts with your friends. If you missed some part of  lecture, you can learn to your friends.
       Finally, some students don’t want to share their materials with their friends because they are also competitors. I think it is not a good idea. Their friends can have some materials which they don’t have, also they can have materials which their friends don’t have. Also, sharing their own notes can be helpful. Every students have their own know-how in taking notes. They can get different insights through reading others’ notes. Sharing materials and datas are more helpful for all of students.
        To sum up, some argue that they wnat to study alone because they can concetrate more, they do not want to talking with their friends, and they don’t want to share their materials. However, it can be more helpful when you study with a group of students. You might get some creative ideas, insights, more concentrations. I recommend you to try studying with your friends. You didn’t like it atfer try it, then you can just study alone. I hope you get your own studying style, and have a good grade!"	4.5	4.5	4	13

" If there is any lesson that I learned throughout the years in schools, it would be the fact that everyone learns differently. One example that shows this circumstance is that some students prefer to study alone, while other prefer to study as a group. I prefer to study alone because it is more efficient and is a more active way of learning.
 Others claim that it is more efficient to study with a group of students, because they think it is efficient. However, I strongly disagree to this claim. I think it is much efficient to study alone. When we study alone, we can concentrate better because you are exposed to less temptations. Most of the study groups that I saw eventually never worked out. They seemed to have too much fun or become too competitive. Even though the study group maintains to function well, I think the process of understanding and memorizing should be done individually in the end. This means that you have to go over and study the materials by yourself, which is not an efficient way to spend your time. Also, in order to meet study groups regurarly you need to match all the schedules with group memebers, which can be time consuming and cumbersome.
 Some people say that we need study groups to prevent studying passively. Nevertheless, I think that we can study much more actively when we study alone. If you have a study group, you ask your questions to your friends. This may appear to be active process, but in fact it is a mere shortcut. It is not helping your academic skills. . For instance, I once asked questions to my friend who takes the same class. There  was concepts where she explained wrongly, and we both got bad results. This would not have happened if we were not so convinced that we can rely on each other. The better way would have been googling, searching books and asking questions to professors, since we have professors and teaching assistants that will give us better answers. Thus, sometimes study groups prevent you from studying more actively. 
 To sum up, I prefer to study alone, because it is more efficient and it is a way to study more actively. In fact, statistic shows that this preference is general in engineering school. This is because we do not have to share our opinions when it comes to undergraduate level math and science."	4.5	5	4.5	14

"At examination period, students study hard to get good grade.  Some students prefer to study with club members and some use study group to get infromation about test. In my case, I prefer to study alone. Thus, I will talk you why I prefer to study alone.  
     First of all, I want to study at silent space. If I study at a noisy situation, I can't focus on studying. For example, there are a lot of people that do something such as drinking coffee or talking with their friends. All the noise in the cafe will be bothering me. Therefore, It cause very low efficiency of studying. Thus, I won't be able to finish my all works.    
     Next, It is better to read a book than to  share opinions. Opinions of friends may not be accurate. For example, If I study alone, I try to check my book to find concept that I was confused or  I can't be memorable. This method is clear, so  there is no need to worry about certainty.
     Last, It helps to save time. When time is running out, we don't have time such as moving other place. If I do study group, I have to ready my part and explain it to others. Therefore, study alone helps to save time. 
     To sum up, I explain why study alone is better. Because of slient and queit situation, we can focus on something well. And It also help to get accurate information by using book directly. As the exam period approaches, the effect will increase. "	3.5	4	4	11.5

"KAIST students have different styles of study. Some of them prefer to study alone, and others prefer to study in group. Those who prefer to study alone insist that they can more concentrate on their study when they study alone. Although there are some advantages of studying alone, I believe that study with a group of students is more efficient way to study.

    First, many have argued that study with a group is waste of time. They insist that if they study together, they feel that they are wasting a time discussing about what they already aware. However, in the process of studying together, we can realize that our misunderstaning knowledge that we thought that have understood. In addition, we can organize the contents by explaining our understanding of knowledge to our friends, and evaluate my understanding. Also, we can accumulate knowledge by asking our friends about things that we did not know or not sure. Therefore, study with a group is more better way to study in terms of efficiency.

    Others argue that, study with a group is harder to concentrate than studying alone. In other words, they claim that if they study with their friends, they will have a chat any will not be able to focus on their studies. However, studies have shown that most people experience more efficiency when they study with their friends. According to statistics from the National Institute of Education, studying in a group showed much more achievement on the exam comparing with studying alone. The researchers conducted an experiment in two groups of students in the fourth grade(about B0) of the mock test of korean SAT. Group A studied alone, and Group B studied by sharing opinions with their group. After three months, the average grade of mock test was 4.2, while Group B’s average test grade was 3.3. Also, the post survey result show that the feeling of concentration also high-rated on Group B compared with Group A. The study results directly refute the opposition insisted that studying together reduces concentration. 


    In conclusion, although studying alone has some benefits, to study as a group showed two benefits compared to study alone. The first factor is that the efficiency of studing has increased, and the second factor is that they could concentrate more easily with studying in a group."	4.5	4.5	4	13
474	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"In universities, there are several places where students can study with some talks. For example, in KAIST, students can study in group study room. We can talk freely about some questions. In contrast, there are some places where students should not talk with friends. They study in separated rooms and they need to keep their mouths for other people around them. Some students prefer to study alone because they don’t like studying with friends talking. However, I will give two reasons that I like study with a group of students.


First, opponents insist that it is hard to concentrate on their own study when they study with friends. However, we can study efficiently with a group of students because friends could look whether we study or not . In my experience, I could study hard with friends because my friends said that you should study hard when I didn’t concentrate on my work. Through their looking, I spent my time not in plaing but in studying.

Secondly, the objection is that  studying alone gives more opponities to learn because students can search through Internet sources. However, we can study efficiently with a group of students through questions. I can ask questions to smart friends. For instance, I was given several advices by my friends, and thanks to that, I could get A+. I talked about why I thought the process is wrong, and friends give another sight.  Friends could give good explanations about your questions.

To sum up, oppoenets insist that students could not concentrate on their own study, and they lose opponities to study through Internet sources. However, students could learn easily with friends. They can concentrate on studying because friends look whether they study or not and they can ask questions to fridends. Therefore, I recommend studying with friends!"	4	4.5	4	12.5

University is representative institutes for education, so many students want to develop their abilities in the university. Some people believe that college or university education should be available for good students. Although that university education should be approachable for just some students is common, university for everyone have more benefits. 
To begin with, it can grow up many smart students. These days, many students give up to enhance their ability because of expensive university expenses. Therefore, if university education is approachable for every student, students can study the subjects that they are interested in and they can be good expertise in that fields. It is good for not only the students but also society because many good expertise means many people do well in each part of society.
In addition to developing students’ ability, it can grow up citizen’s quality. This is because common university education makes many people attend universities, so it can teach them not only knowledge but also common sense and rules for society. Although getting high education is not equal to being right person, high education tends to make people be right. 
Some argue that it just wastes money; because many students are not interested in study, they are not suitable for being expertise. However, it is not true every student don’t need to go university, they can easily drop their courses if they think the courses are not suitable for them. 
To sum up, common university education makes good expertise for each field and grow up citizen’s quality. Therefore, university education should be available for every students"	4	4	3.5	11.5

A college or university education is important to society and students. Although some people believe that a college or university education should be available only good students, the higher education should be available to all students. Two reasons support this argument: opportunities to learn of students, and potential of students.
     First of all, society should give opportunities to learn to students. Learning is very important to everybody, but the opportunities to learn have been restricted to someone who does not show great grade. However, it should be changed because students still have right to study what they want and avoid discrimination by grade. 
     In addition to opportunities to learn, students have potential. As all people know, people show great power on site what they love. Students will have a big potential in major what they have interest, so they could be a great people on their major part if they can take higher education on their interesting major. Students who learn more about what they want will positively affect to society. 
     Some argue that it is effective to select students and focus on them for society. However, that argue has a big problem; grade don not say everything about students; for example, there are students who show the best performance on the university even though they were not exceptional students in high school. High school grades may say ability of taking a grade, but it can not say everything about students.
     To sum, Students should be able to get higher education. They have right to learn what they want, and that right will give positive effect to society. Society should go to direction where all people are encouraged to learn what they want."	4	4	3.5	11.5

     Education is important because it helps people in changing their behavior and their way of thinking. Since ancient times, education was an essential base for having or initiating a developed and improved civilization. However, nowadays, several people think that the opportunity of higher education should be given to good students, who do well in certain studies, only, and in my opinion, in this life, everyone deserves to have such an opportunity for several reasons.
     First of all, some people argue that letting average-skilled people to take courses in a higher level of education is waste of money and time; in addition, they think that focusing on only good students will allow professors to explain contents fast and well, and that kind of action may lead to a rapid increase in students’ performance and participation. Their plan is creating a society where above the average students lead or control average or below the average students in every work field. 
     Giving the opportunity of education to only a certain group of people is indeed a wrong decision because since old times, people aim and pay efforts endlessly to have a stable society where everyone stays on the same level and has the same opportunity of living. Such a decision will only bring harm to this world, and it may increase the number of crimes in several regions of nations. 
     In addition, that kind of decision faces a disagreement from many sides because the only way to improve a certain society is to increase the number of learners. Having more students is sure a good sign for creating new paths in learning and teaching as well; moreover, being good in school doesn’t mean doing well in college or university. Some people may do bad in their period of studying in high schools, but they show an increase in their performance once they enter the university. 
     To conclude, every student deserves to have the same opportunity of education as everyone else. Some people think that giving such an opportunity to a certain group of people will save money and time but unfortunately, it goes the opposite way. The more students you have in your country, the more improvements your country will approach to, and encouraging people to study or continue their studies is the base for such improvements.

Universities usually select their students by their own test or interview. No university is allowed to everyone, and some people say that universities should open their sources for education to all students who want to learn that course. Although it is good way to reduce the gap of education, it is almost impossible for university to open their course to everyone. Higher education should be available only to selected students.
First of all, it is clear that the quality of education will become lower when it is served to more students. When the number of students grow bigger, it will be hard to get all questions from students. Students can not hear the lecture well when the classroom is too large for many students. Also, students will fill harder to ask questions about their lecture with too many students; instructors will fill harder to understand their students understood their lecture or not. The course become not efficient with too many students, and it is why many current courses have their upper limit of students.
Moreover, universities can not afford all students when anyone can participate in their course. Most courses do not only do lecture, but they contain several homework, quizzes, and tests. With too many students, universities will not afford to maintain their course as when with smaller number of students. Especially, courses containing argument in class will be almost impossible to participate all students who want to hear. It makes the actual problem when everyone can join the class.
Some argue that although some inefficiency exists, universities should open their lecture to everyone who want to hear that lecture for the equality for education. However, they should recognize that universities are not for charity. Universities already selected students and focus on them to invest; furthermore, the ways of selection are fair. People who want to study course of universities should take exam for admission, and go to the university to get that course. Since all university students do this to participate in the course, it becomes unfair when others can just hear lecture when they want to participate.
It is very important that all people should be treated equally, and they should be able to learn what they want. However, learning something have their own tracks. People who want to hear university courses should become the university student; otherwise, it is not fair to university students who studied hard to become the students of that university. Moreover, participating every people have some actual problems like the quality problem or the fact that university can not afford it. Courses in university should be opened only to university students."	4	4	3.5	11.5

In Korea, most students prepare to go to university. Some believe that the country can develop when everyone has a higher education. Although some say that higher education has to be for everyone, it should be available only to good students for several reasons. 
First of all, students can regret choosing unwanted majors. When students are in high school, it is rare for them to clearly decide on their own career path; therefore, students go to university without deep thoughts. To be specific, students in Korea go to university according to their grades, and there is a high probability that this does not match their aptitude. This often leads to regret.
In addition to regret postponing decisions about career, false sense of society that everyone must attend college can arise. Even if the college major does not match people, it is not easy for them to quit colleges. This is because of the social perception that most students have to attend college. To be specific, many students over the country who graduate their meaningless college life prepare for public servants in Korea.
Some oppose to higher education for good students because of the develop for country. Many ways to improve the country without graduating from college exist. In fact, Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs started a big company even if they did not graduate from college. In addition, many ways to develop the country without graduating from college, such as doing volunteer work for others exist.
To sum up, only some students need to go to college for several reasons. In this way, they will not regret their choices and social awareness will grow right. Students need to seriously think about their college admissions."	4	4	3.5	11.5

College and university are commonly highest education institution for students. Most of all students study hard to enter better college or university until their high school. Even though it is the fact that the lecture of college and university provides more advanced things than high school, it does not mean every student need higher education. To provide higher education only to good students has several benefits than to all students.
First of all, to give chance of higher education to every student is extremely expensive. Programs and lectures in college and university are different with previous ones; they require numbers of expensive tools, extra space, and more experts such as professor. For example, to open a chemistry class, a lot of chemicals, flasks, and even professors are required.
Next, higher education is never necessary for everyone. Commonly, things that students learn from college or university are not directly related to real-world things because they learn a lot of latest and advanced theory in their major. For instance, while all of KAIST students learn calculus and physics in 1st grade, but most of them are useless: such as line integration, surface integration, and wave function theory.
Although some still claim providing higher educations only to good students harms an equality in education. However, they have to consider whether it is real equality or not. If college or university education is available to all students, most of students will take higher education even they are not interested in studying; it may consume students’ time to develop themselves in other categories. 
To sum up, to give a chance of higher education only to good students have several benefits than to all students. While an equality in education can be a problem with this selective higher education, selective higher education can provide more chance and positive effect to students who may be victim in selective higher education. Thus, college or university education should be available only to good students."	4.5	4.5	4	13

People are born and take compulsory education for an average of 10 years. In Korea, elementary school, middle school, and first year of high school is regulated as compulsory education, Korean students must complete this curriculum unless they have a special reason. However, in the case of higher education, there are many pros and cons as to whether it should be provided to all students or not. In my opinion, higher education should only be provided to some of the best students for the following reasons.
First of all, providing higher education to every student wastes money, time and manpower. Just because every student has a higher education does not mean they understand it. Higher education literally means ‘intensified' education for some subject. In other words, students who do not have sufficient prior knowledge in that field may have a difficulty to understand the higher education. Giving higher education to students who do not understand is a waste of time, money and manpower.
In addition to waste of sources problem, providing higher education to only excellent students will help students find their real value. Everyone has their own talents. That talent could be study, dance, or song. Depending on these talents, everyone will choose a different job. In this case, many jobs in society all demand different skill, but higher education could not educate all these skills. As in following example, the skill needed by a tile mechanics is to squeeze silicone well, not to solve calculus problems well. Rather, higher education in mathematics will only take effect when it is provided to a friend who is good at math. 
Until now, many have argued that not providing higher education to all is a violation of the principle of equality. However, providing opportunities of higher-education only to good students can prevents all students from taking the same career path. For example, in Korea nowadays, higher education opportunities are available to all students. Therefore, a great part of Korean high school students enter college unconditionally, even if they do not have a subject they want to learn at college. The main reason for this is that the social perception sees students who didn't go to college as losers. I think this problem can be prevented if college education in a specific field is provided only to students who are excellent in a specific field.
In conclusion, allowing higher education only to excellent students prevents wasted money, time and manpower and helps students create individual their value. Korean society considers those who cannot go to college as losers. However, this is a misconception. Even if some students do not have a college education, but they know their true worth and works on their dreams, they will be a real success."	5	4.5	4.5	14

The whole world is in a pandemic and all countries are fighting with Covid-19. Not only the pandemic, but many industries and new technologies are emerging and developing in the world under the wave of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Therefore, not only excellent medical personnel but also engineering personnel are required in society. There are two reasons that all people should need a higher level of education.
First, as society becomes more complex and develops, high-quality manpower is required in any field. However, the supply of manpower is not sufficient as necessary. For example, now, with the combination of IT and objects such as IOT, not only IT but also knowledge about objects must be made. Students have to learn a lot in college in order to have the diverse knowledge thus it is difficult to know both IT and objects, human resources are not supplied as much as society needs. As society becomes more complex and requires more and more smart talent, it is necessary to provide higher education opportunities to all students.
In addition to, it is a very important solution to overcome the low birth rate problem. In Korea, the total birth rate is less than one. In the past, there were so many children that it was enough to have some smarts. However, in the current society, there are not many children due to low birth rates, so everyone should be smart. Now everyone must do their own role at society. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of low birth rate, all children must be well educated and sent to society.
Some argue that, society has a limited budget and it is impossible to educate everyone. This criticism is correct only in developing countries. In the case of Korea, it is a country with a budget of over 500 trillion won per year and it is developed country. In the case of developed countries, budgets are sufficient, but education budgets are insufficient due to other priorities. Education determines the future of the country, so adequate education budget is required.
To sum up, in order to solve many problems in the current society, it is necessary to provide opportunities for university education to all people. Education should be viewed as a point of investment for the future. Ten dollars of investment in education now will return to ten thousand dollars in the future. Provide college education opportunities for everyone."	4	4	4	12

          Many students want to enter better college to take better education. Many students in good universities are satisfied because their college have high-quality education, but students in low universities are dissatisfied because the quality of their classes is not good. Although some people think that higher education should be given only to good students, making education available to all students is better.
          First of all, education inequality will decrease. Some students have a hard time to study because of their family or money. If the change of education is given only good students, these poor students will not get knowledge and education inequality will increase. However, if higher education become available for every students, student can learn regardless of their situation.
          In addition to knowledge, better education make world better. Since the quality of lecture is depend on professor, academic performance can be effected by the quality of lecture. If students can study with well-made lecture, their performance will increase; as a result, a society will be improved.
          Some argue that education should be available only to good students because they study hard to enter the university. However, the essence of university is to explore the truth. Therefore, if someone want to explore the truth, university should welcome them. 
          To sum up, the change of education should be given to all students. Since the knowledge is not belong to someone, every students should be guaranteed the right to learn. Also, if education is given to every students, inequality will decrease and the world become better. Therefore, university should provide education for all students."	4	4	3.5	11.5

In Korea there are several types of school such as elementary school, middle school, high school and college. Government force everyone to go to some of these schools such as elementary school by law, for help everyone to get educated; however, they don’t force everyone to go to college. College teaches more specialized knowledge to help people to be more specialized, so they are called higher education. Some people believe that higher education such as college or university education should be available to all students; however, I think that it should be available only to good students. 
To begin with, government use a lot of money to support colleges. All students in college must pay tuition fee which is very expensive. Now days, government help most of students to pay for only half of their tuition fee by using their budget. According to one interview, almost 90 percent of college students answered that they have experienced help from government’s half tuition fee project. When college education be available to all students, huge amount of money will be wasted because of the students who are not good at studying. 
In addition, society does not need to have too much specialized people. Contents people learn in college are very specialized. In schools such as middle school, people learn about things that are necessary for living in our society. College teaches people about very specialized contents which will help them to get better jobs, however. Since there is no need for every people to be specialized, college are not necessity for all people.  
Some people argue that higher education should be available to all students because people should get chance to get higher education. However, every people get equal chance to get higher education, so this argument does not hold. Every people get equal chance to do better work and to be better students before entering higher education. When they become good students, they will get chance to enter for higher education. 
To sum up, government use a lot of money to support colleges and society does not need to have too much specialized people. All students do not have to feel like they must have to get higher education.

These days, many people go to the university or college. There are some reasons to go there such as to getting their future job. Some other students do not go to the university or college, so they learn some skills for their job. For example, some people learn how to make a pen, so they get a job in pen factory. Although many people prefer to go to the university or college, it is not necessary for several reasons.
First of all, all students do not have ability to study in there. Many students just go to the university, yet they do not want to go. They just go there because of their parents or teachers. After go university, they do not have some responsibility. Because of this, some students do not prepare to study in university. These students may be hard to following the courses in university.
In addition, there are many ways for their future. Many people think that people have to graduate the university to get a job; however, there are many people get their job even do not graduate the university. For example, someone learn how to make a micro chip after he graduate the high school. After several years, he become expert of that area. It is not only way to success their life.
Some argue that go to the university is necessary because if they graduate the university or college, they can expect to get grate job; however, they can also get some high quality of jobs without graduate from university. For example, Bill Gates drop the university; however, he become one of the famous people in the world. Many people will say he success he’s life. To success life and getting a great job not necessary certification of graduation. It requires just your abilities and efforts.
To sum up, some people hard to follow the course in university because they do not prepare to study in university, so they do not have some ability to study in there. In addition, there are some other ways to get some job or success their life. For example, if they learn some skills the society needed, they will be needed you, so people just do their best in their area. Then, success will be followed."	4	4	3.5	11.5

Many students live in the dormitory for several reasons. Some live there because of the distance, while some of them live dorm because of the cost. Although some students want to have a chance to make friends with roommates which university make for, dormitory is, in my opinion, some kind of house for students, so students should choose their own roommates. First, there could be a trouble if a student who school assign for the student. Next, students could their own hobby or interest with roommate who chosen by them.
To begin with, students spend their own time on the dormitory, and it is important to feel comfortable on that time. People have all different own character, it is same for the students. Thus, the roommate that is not own roommate would make a significant difference between them; then, the room could not be the best place to rest and they would always fight. In my own case, I was used the random roommate 2 years ago. At the first meeting, he seems to be a good person; however, few weeks later, he was not a clean man. He took a shower once per three days and left food for a one week on the desk. The smell of the room was terrible and the room was not feeling good for me. 
On top of that, as mentioned earlier, students spend a lot of time on their dorm. Students are not a machine for studying, so they should play for a several hours then they enjoy their own time as well. At that time, roommate could be a best partner to play with. Although random roommate could have the same hobby, the possibility is too low and if they choose their roommate, then it is one hundred percent coincidence with the roommate. Also, if the roommate has different interest, he or she have to find out friends outside of the dorm; it might be a time wasting.
On the other hand, some might say that random roommates could be a opportunity to make a new friend. Because there are not that much time for playing, they can easily contact a new person without effort. However, there are so many clubs in universities and it could be the better chance than the random roommate. They have the same interest, and it could help them more familiar easily.
To sum up, it could be a hard time for students when they are not matched on lifestyle which make problem between them. Assigning is not an efficient way for students rest as well. In addition, they have lots of other manner to make a new friend. Therefore, the university are not responsible for assigning the roommate because it could make the better result if students choose."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

College and university education are higher education. This education is optional.  Some people claim that only qualified students should go to college; however, in my opinion, the chance of higher education should be provided to every student.  
First, one can make valuable relationships with the people met in college. In a college, students not only take the lecture but also participate in diverse activities such as attending parties, playing sports, or join concerts. Through these events, one can make friendships with peers, seniors, and juniors. This relationship would help one’s social life in the future. 
Second, students get a potential career and financial benefits. Some jobs require licenses which only can get through a college education or bachelor's degree. Also, many companies offer internships to only college students. Students provided a more diverse option when getting higher education such as entering graduate schools
It may be true that for some students, high tuition would be a burden. However, the Korean system of scholarship support is systematic and effective. Students can get enough support from the public scholarship foundation called ‘KOSAF’. Also, the private scholarship foundation offers tuition, too.  Many schools are making tuition-free for students from poor families. 
To sum up, higher education is beneficial for future careers and making relationships. So higher education should be provided to every student."	4	4	4	12

These days, many people think that graduating from university is necessary, so they talk about what level of students should be allowed to attend college. Some people believe that a college education should be available to all students. However, allowing only good students to attend college is more helpful for students.
First of all, a class is more suitable for students. If the college is open to all students, there will be students of various levels. Their level of knowledge and understanding will vary widely, so it will be difficult to set the level of the class and proceed. When the student’s levels are somewhat high and constant, they will be able to have a more appropriate education and improve their knowledge.
In addition to suitable education, student’s knowledge can be improved through competition. If students have similar knowledge level and when they are all study hard, they will compete among themselves. Through competition, students will study harder and concentrate on their studies to fill their shortcomings.
Some people argue that allowing only good students to attend college is unfair. While it is true that everyone should have the same opportunity. However, the quality of education and atmosphere of class should be guaranteed because students pay tuition fees. When only good students attend to college, the atmosphere of the class is even better because students who want to study hard gathered. 
To sum up, limiting the level of students who can attend college is important for students. Students can take classes that fit their levels, and they can compete each other and develop themselves. Therefore, higher education should be available only to good students."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Recently, most students in Korea are going to college or university. Usually, even if students are not good at studying, they can enter college if they pay money. At some point, everyone is considered to have to graduate college of university. Some argue that college or university education should be available to all students because of equality of opportunity. But there are several reasons why only good students should get a high level of education.
First, if everyone gets a higher education, a lot of the country's money will be spent on education. Students who do not want to study do not have to spend a lot of money on education. Rather, using this money to create jobs would make society more efficient.
     In addition to that, different people have different talents, and not all those with different talents do things that require higher education. For example, in the case of street cleaners or chefs, high education is not necessary. Of course, high degree of education may help them do their job, but it is questionable whether it is worth spending that much time and money.
     Some argue that higher education makes society better by raising everyone's standards. Even if that is true, competition becomes fiercer when everyone becomes highly educated. Even if there is no need for higher education to some jobs, there will be a phenomenon of preferring those who graduated from university, so that they will become obsessed with graduating from universities that were useless like Korea now.
     In short, giving everyone the opportunity for higher education is a waste of money and intensifies competition. Also, not all jobs require higher education. Therefore, the government should try to provide educational opportunities that meet individual talents and goals."	4	4	4	12

People enter to university after graduating high school to learn more professional information and to get professionality. In Korea, a lot of people go to university; however, some people think that university should be available only to good students. Although not every job needs to have academical information, university should open to everyone.
First of all, chances have to be open to everyone. It is not fair to restrict their probabilities to grow to be a well-educated person only because he or she didn’t do well in the past. For example, a boy who didn’t study well in high school can realize that he should study very hard to earn a lot of money after graduating high school. If there is no chance for that person to study in a university, he may be very disappointed and have a hard time finding what he is going to be in the future.
Second, universities not only teach professional information but also leadership and communication skills through a lot of social activities and group homework. These skills are important to be a good worker because they need to work with many and various people when they get a job. Since universities can teach them, everyone should be able to get university education.
On the other hand, some people say that university or college education should be open only to students who did well in high school because not every job needs professional and academic education. However, although it seems that some jobs need only simple information, for students who want to have ability to improve themselves, they need more education.
In conclusion, everyone should be available to get college or university education because they should have chances to be a well-educated person. Also, universities teach leadership and communication skills that are important to be a good worker. University and college education can make students to be a better person in the future. These are the reasons why university and college education should be open to everyone."	5	4.5	4.5	14

Human have improved their life with the development of both science and engineering. Since nowaday’s technology is too improved, it is true that creative thinking in natural science fields is also required. Currently, some argue that students also practice this creative thing with taking various type of classes in KAIST, and previous university prepares this type of routines for students. However, taking specific subject of courses need in KAIST for several reasons.
First of all, KAIST has purpose of growing skillful engineers. KAIST established in 1960s with purpose of development for science and engineering of Korea, and studying this long historical academy required not 1-2 years. In other words, serving specific subject class will be more acceptable.
In addition to school’s purpose, structure of natural science can be reason. Today’s science have close connection with the other field of science, and taking one courses actually require more information of subjects to students. In other words, even if students takes specific subject of courses, it is also grow students unconsciously. 
Some argue that creative thinking needs various fields of informations. It seems that have correct logic, but there is a mistake in it. This argument has assumption that students have fluent thinking in this various fields; however, enginering is too large that undergraduate students cannot cover all of it in 4 years. 
To sum up, KAIST serves to students with one specific rountine for study. It satisfied their foundation purpose, give informations in various fields, and grow students to think fluently."	4	4	3.5	11.5

  In January, college students start to make their next semester schedule. It is always difficult to decide what classes to take for next semester. Some people say that students should learn various subjects during their college life; however, in my perspective, students should concentrate on one subject because specialized students are better for getting a job and being a fast learner. 
Specialized students are easy to get a job than generalized students. In job market, needs of employers are clear, which is hiring people who can help their work right after they hire. Specialists are easy to start their work right after graduation because they know deeply about their field which is enough for starting practical work. In my personal experience, I start to work as designer because I learned deeply about design process with several classes about design.  
In addition to job opportunity, learning one subject deeply increase the speed of learning. Every subject has stiff learning curve at first, for every subject has different perspective and needed knowledge; however, when student learns next advanced contents, they can learn faster and more efficient because student have already learned basic. For example, learning biology and history simultaneously is harder than learning advanced biology. 
Opponents would contend that learning various subject is important because it helps to have wide perspective. It is true; however, students do not have to widen their perspective in college. After graduation, especially in work, students will meet various of people with various major. Communicating with them can widen their perspective enough, besides if they want, they can study some basics of other subjects whatever they want. Thus, students do not have to learn various subjects on college. 
To sum up, students should learn one subject deeply rather than various subject lightly. It has benefits on getting a job faster, and it is easier and faster to learn when they study based on their accumulated knowledge in one subject. Some may assist that students should learn various subject which can make broad point of view; however, it is better to get wide point of view after they graduation. Thus, in my perspective, students should be specialist, not a generalist. "	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

These days, there is controversy over whether universities should require students to take classes in many subjects or to specialize in one subject. Some universities insist that the students have to expand their knowledge by learning and integrating various fields. However, in my opinion, specializing in one subject have several fascinating advantages for students.
The first reason is that students can save their time to study. It is true that students have a lot to do, such as clubs, sports, hobbies, and talking with friends in addition to studying; also, there is not enough time to study one subject intensively. For example, in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, my major, lots of information have to be studied to familiarize with concepts, memorize formulas, and solve various application problems. Students in this major need enough time to study through all these processes. If students study deeply in their one subject, students will be able to become experts by practicing and learning enough about their major.
In addition to saving study time, students can get less stress from studying. When students take lots of subjects, assignments and tests in various fields increase; in addition, these tasks and exams differ in the conditions required to complete the subject, such as enough time for coding in computer engineering and the ability to solve various problems in mathematics. To achieve these subjects with different personalities, students need a lot of effort and talent; as a result, the stress that students receive increases. Therefore, it is very stressful for students to accomplish various subjects at the same time.
Some argue that students’ knowledge can be broadened because all subjects are connected; also, taking classes in various subjects helps to develop the ability to apply through other subjects. Besides, they argue that students can find and enjoy their true interests by taking a variety of subjects. Even if there are these arguments, taking class in one subject is better for some reasons mentioned above.
To sum up, specializing one subject have lots of advantages for students. Students can save and control efficiently time to study and get less stress from learning various subjects. To improve better students’ university life, concentrating on specific subjects is better option for students."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

There are lots of universities in Korea. University which teaches highly advanced and complex subjects has two types of education system. First type is teaching many subjects to students, and second type is teaching one subject to students. In my opinion, taking classes in many subjects has several advantages.
First of all, taking classes in many subjects can be helpful for finding aptitude for students. Before attending to the university, students do not have enough time to conduct their aptitude or dream. It is a clear statement that high school and middle school education is not sufficient for finding aptitude in Korea. In fact, students are focus on getting good grade in high school and middle school to go to the good university. When student take classes in many subjects, they can find their aptitude and dream for their future; thus, they will set a goal and move forward to realize it.
In addition, it can provide the opportunity to find their hobby. Indeed, students do not have a chance to realize their real hobbies. Classes in universities such as football class, robot class, and game class would be a helpful class for finding real hobbies. Real hobbies that are in professional field such as manipulating a drone can not only release the stress of students but also recharge themselves batteries. After enjoying the hobbies, students can concentrate more on their tasks, and students will focus more on the class of their major.
Some argues that taking classes in many subjects would be a detrimental system for developing their professional knowledge. Also, others argue that taking many subjects is wasting of time, and finding aptitude is up to the students. Even though opposite argument insists that taking classes in many subjects is not a helpful decision for students, it provides an opportunity to know and develop themselves. When finding their real hobbies and aptitudes, students will be happy in their university life. Taking classes in many subjects can lead to a virtuous cycle.
In conclusion, taking classes in many subjects would be a wonderful decision for students. However, it is an issue that needs to be decided by coordinating the opposition. After coordinating the opposition, it would be a perfect choice for students happy university life."	4	4	4	12

University is the pinnacle of the education system. People who want to learn higher education and interact with colleagues enter to the university. Many of people argue that all students are eligible for studying in a colleague because they believe it is a right of them; people have a belief that all students can achieve higher academic goals. However, this claim is flawed because of these aspects:
The first reason that university should accept only good students is to keep a high quality of class. In other words, if all students have a chance to enter the university and register the classes, they rather cannot learn advanced contents in there. At the beginning of classes, professors check the academic level of students to determine the difficulty of the classes; however, when their level is varied, it is hard to control it. If professors fail to control the difficulty of classes, Students who have lower academic ability cannot follow the classes; on the other hand, good students who want to learn higher level of contents do not satisfy the classes. Therefore, anyone cannot take satisfying classes when students academic ability is totally different.
In addition to offer students high quality of classes, the degree of efforts can be the reason. That is, good students usually show more efforts in the classes, which have more possibility to achieve high academic goal. Academic ability cannot be gained without the efforts because there are lots of contents to learn in higher level of classes; therefore, people who showed remarkable grade in the universities have a common feature: the effort. Students who do not make efforts for studying cannot get high academic ability, which is a goal of university. Thus, it is necessary for colleges to choose only good students.
Although some people argue that all students have the equal ability to learn high contents. However, unfortunately, it is obvious that peoples have the different academic ability. This can be an obstacle for learning high level of academic fields. For example, math is the one of the fields that sense is important; students who do not have good senses cannot study the higher level of math. 
In conclusion, university should accept good students. If university accept all students, they cannot offer the high quality of classes due to difficulty of controlling the level of classes. Moreover, good students usually shows the high efforts in studying, which is the necessary condition to obtain high academic skills. Furthermore, there are fundamental difference in academic ability among students. Thus, it is recommended for colleges to choose good students, which may be better for both ordinary students and good students."	4.5	4.5	4	13

University students usually have to choose their major. Some students major in only one subject and takes courses from the subjects; however, other students choose double major or takes classes in many subjects. Although some people feel that students should be specialized in one subject, university students have to take classes in many subjects.
First of all, learning in many subjects helps students to understand each subjects. There are some similar logics or ideas in different subjects, and some subjects are basics for other subjects. For example, math itself is a wide and deep major, but it is basic for other science and engineering subjects. Therefore, students can study other subjects to get idea when they are having difficulties on understanding some subjects. If the students only take classes in one subject, students can easily get stuck and cannot proceed learning, for the one major uses same words, definitions and theories.
In addition, point of view for other subjects can be changed. For the university students, it is first time to study advanced subjects; therefore, students still do not know what majors they are good for or what majors they are interested in. If students keep to major in one subjects, they can find out the major is not fitted can be depressed. However, if students take classes in many subjects, they can find their favorites fast and change their main major.
Some argue that specializing in one subject is needed to become an expert. However, students can learn in depth at graduate courses. The undergraduate courses are advanced, but they are also basics for the graduate courses. Therefore, becoming an expert is done in graduate courses, and students have to stack the basics in many subjects to study well in graduate courses.
To sum up, learning in many subjects can help students to study and to plan for their future. Choosing appropriate major is important for the university students. Therefore, the universities should require students to take classes in many subjects."	4	4	4	12

In university, students have chances to choose their classes for what they want to take. However, for their graduation, some universities have policy about additional requirement for taking classes. Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. In my opinion, specializing in one subject has several benefits.
First of all, by studying one subject deeply in several years, students can have expertise. Four years are considerably long period to learn something. The students who take one specific subject for four years would have deep knowledge about the subject; from basic to advanced. However, students who take several classes might have less deep knowledge about their major. 
In addition, students can practice to focus on one specific subject for several years. After graduating the university, students should get their job and most of them might work for more than decade. It means that they should work for one company in one field. People who are not familiar to work in one field can have difficulties maintaining their job and possibly try to find other jobs. However, those who are trained to work in a specific field for a long time can maintain their job for a long period. Students have a chance to train this ability in their universities. By specializing in one subject for more than four years, students can learn the attitude for long-run.
Some argue that, taking several subjects are helpful for students to increase variety of their knowledge. However, this is not what students should get in universities. Little knowledge in several subjects is actually not helpful for any of those fields. Universities are where students build their base in their major and get ready for the next level such as job or graduate school. With little knowledge in several subjects, students cannot go to the next level in any field.
To conclude, for expertise and training long term studying, specializing in one subject is better for students. It will help students to have robust basis for their major which can help them in further studying or job."	4.5	4	4	12.5

     When students enter university, they learn more deep and various contents than before. The classes that students will be learning is important because it is related to their career path. Some universities require students to take classes in various subjects; however, I think that it is more helpful for students to specialize in only one subject.
     First of all, specializing in one subject can increase students’ achievement. If students study various subjects, the amount of study will increase significantly. Large amount of study gives lots of stress to students, which decreases their ability to learn. On the other hand, if students specialize in one subject, their achievement and ability to learn will increase because the amount of study will be reduced.
     The second reason is that it can help students to study more intensively. Studying in various subjects interrupt students’ concentration. If students are forced to learn subjects they are not interested in, the concentration of study will naturally decrease. Studying only one subject makes them study much more efficiently and intensively.
     Some believe that taking various subjects is a great help in making career decisions. They argue that it is important to experience various fields to decide their career path. However, specialize in one subject is more helpful for students’ career path. Studying various subjects makes students become confused when making career decisions.
     To sum up, specialize in one subject is helpful for students in several ways. It increases the achievement and concentration of study, and it helps to decide career path. Students must work toward to their goals through various studies."	4.5	4.5	4	13

Some people believe that universities should require students to specialize in one subject; however, other universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Although these two types of education seem to be helpful to students, I think students should take classes in various fields. There are three reasons for my opinion though there can be a different opinion.
      First of all, students can find their interests through taking many subjects because students actually don’t know what they want to study. In KAIST, every freshman should take basic subjects in various areas such as physics, chemistry, and biology. Next year, students should select their major, so many students have one year to consider their interests and choose their future working industry. Furthermore, students can change their major when they are not first or second grades. College students are young, so they can receive chances to investigate many areas and find which area they want to be experts. 
      In addition, wide knowledge is good although that knowledge cannot be deep. One of my friend works at laboratory, and he always say that college students should take classes which are not their major. Because sometimes researcher does research by coming up with ideas which are not primarily related to his area. He is an electrical engineering researcher, but his research also uses biology. Generally, It is necessary to know more than one field if you want to success for your job.
      Though some people insist that to specialize in one subject is a college job, it can be achieved by taking many subjects in college. KAIST students would be experts in many ways, for example, they are researchers, business people, and even startup people. KAIST students can learn various subjects, but it does not mean that they cannot be a specialist in one area. In my case, as I was a freshman, I don’t know what I want to be. I just took classes from more than 2 majors, and I changed my major twice. I satisfied my decision, and now I know what I want to be and which major I am engage in.
In conclusion, pros and cons exist between two types of college education. Students can get advantages through taking various subjects; for example, they can find their interests, get wide knowledge, and be a specialist who contains various understanding. Becoming a specialist needs high efforts, so students should take more than one majors and study many subjects."	4	4	4	12

When students enter the university, they select one major and start to study in their major. In most universities, students can enroll in any class regardless of major. Taking classes in many subjects has various benefits. 
     First of all, students need to find where they are interested in by studying in many fields. When they are entering the university first time, they only studied at the high school level; therefore, they don’t really know about their interest. Students don’t know anything about the major and trendy research field. After they study many fields and search for them, students can find where they are interested and want to study more. For instance, there are no chances to meet the information of major research fields and professors who research in their major. The majority of students meet the first time in university-level information and consider for their future first time after they come to university.
     In addition to finding interest, students can find where they are talented in. Students simply memorize information and take tests in high school; thus, they judge their talents only with test scores. In fact, a person's talent cannot be judged solely by the score of the test. While taking classes in different disciplines, students have the opportunity to judge their talents by comparing how well they can follow the class, how easy it is to understand, and how quickly ideas for assignments come to mind. After students enter the university, they should take many different field courses and need time to seriously think about their talents. In fact, at KAIST, there are many cases that students check their talent by taking courses in different fields and change their major. 
     Some people argue that focusing on one major is much advantageous when students enter to the company; however, it fits in the past and the present has changed. Today, globalization is progressing rapidly, and many companies are hoping for convergence talent. Since most of the modern technologies are convergent technologies, a collaboration between experts in various fields is important. A person who knows only one field is difficult to cooperate with other people because of a poor understanding of other fields. Students need to know the basics of various fields since college so that they can smoothly cooperate with experts in other fields when entering a company and developing or conducting projects. For example, in the part of researching smartphones, many fields such as battery, display, communication, UI, human-computer interaction, CPU, and semiconductor are converged to conduct research. Therefore, knowing the basics of each field makes it easier to come up with ideas on how to increase efficiency by fusion.
     To sum up, the chance to take many classes in several majors are very important to students for some reasons. Students have to find where they are interested in and where they are talented, and they have to learn in many fields to get advantages in research after they enter to company. Students have to take classes in many subjects."	4	3.5	4	11.5

Many students in Korea try for a very long time to enter university. However, not everyone has the opportunity to receive a higher education in proportion to their efforts. Education opportunities are restricted due to CSAT scores and high school grades. Many people say that higher education should only be given to good students, but all students should be given this opportunity.
First of all, there is a lack of data to evaluate a good student. The content of university education aims at a very different direction, qualitatively and quantitatively, compared to the preceding education. Therefore, it is unreasonable to evaluate students through previous content and provide them with opportunities for higher education accordingly. For example, until high school, students who neglect their studies for various reasons, such as family environment, have low grades; However, if they have a new intention to study, it is right to give them a chance even in this situation. The presence of these criteria stems from doubts about scholastic ability in university classes, but there are limitations in evaluating with previous data, so it is not right to limit opportunity.
In addition, students who want to get a higher education can perform better. For example, many university students do not come to college because they feel a great desire to get an education. It's just that other people make these choices to go to college. However, in universities, people who want to study do much better. Since higher education deals with a large and difficult level, it should be given an opportunity for those who want to work hard with will.
Many think it would be good to be with good students, but spending time with people in various situations is also very progressive. In other words, universities need to set the way to put students in various environments. People with different growth backgrounds and economic situations can learn a lot in the process of understanding each other's environment. In universities, it is necessary to share opinions and share situations that students have never experienced in person.
To sum up, college education should be given the opportunity to all students due to the lack of evaluation data and the will of college education. This may be a concern in the question of equality and quality, but the answer that universities should ultimately pursue is in this direction."	4.5	4	4.5	13

In KAIST, students have chances to take classes in many subjects not only when they are freshmen but also when they are not freshmen; therefore, they can change their fields if they are not interested in. However, in some universities, students are required to follow one field as they choose their fields before they enter the universities, so students can learn it in detail. Although some argue that universities require students to specialize in one subject, in my opinion, universities should require students to take classes in many subjects due to various reasons.
The first reason is that students have more chances to explore their future jobs if they know various fields. Students who learn one subject are less likely to be interested in various fields, because they don’t know about other fields. For example, students who did not study biology will confine their jobs related to biology. Also, as students meet with professors or friends from various fields, they can get some information about what students can study and learn in other fields. 
In addition to more chances to explore their future jobs, most subjects are not isolated from other subjects; for example, in mechanical engineering, if students want to make a robot that helps people, they should know biology to know a human’s body. When students get jobs and cooperate with coworkers, students at least know the other people’s fields to understand their ideas and work together. Today, many people from different fields cooperate.
Some can argue that studying various subjects will result in the state students do not know about subjects deeply and thoroughly. It is important to learn thoroughly each subject, but if students want to learn more about the subject they are interested in, they can learn it in detail in undergraduate school. When they are in college, students try to learn various fields, so they choose subjects they want to learn deeply in undergraduate school.
To sum up, universities should require students to take classes in many subjects because students can explore their future jobs, and many subjects are not isolated from others. Today, 4th industry needs a lot of compound knowledge; therefore, students who learn various subjects will be able to survive in this period. Many companies and research institutes need a lot of person who know a lot of knowledges; students should realize this trend."	4	4	3.5	11.5

To solve this problem, there are some people state that it is not necessary to give university education for all people so that overcome this crazy hard practice. However, for several reason, it is not a good idea to solve the problem. Indeed, university education should be available to all students.
First of all, university will give a chance to change their life for students. It is not difficult to find the person who succeed in university, while did not practice hard until high school. If that person did not choose university, it will be disaster for society. Because there is no grantee that society can detect the potential of person, educational limitation is unnecessary.
In addition to first, high educated national people are necessary in order to maintain democratic government. In Korea, the demos of 20 century are organized by university students, teachers, and some intelligences. Since these eyes are watching government, Korean can maintain democratic country. This is why intelligences are important, and this is why all people could receive university education.
Some argues that university will available only to good students in order to stop crazy practice in high school. However, this argument is not fact; Indeed, real society will not flow like this.

Each people have different talent and they develop it from studying. In university, there are many departments for more efficiency teaching. It is also important to have professional knowledge in major area to paly an important role in society. I suggest universities require student to specialize in one subject. There are several reasons for my arguments.
First of all, the amount of knowledge a person can learn is limited. In university, the main point for students to achieve their knowledge of their major fields. The deeper knowledge of own major, it will be more valuable. Studying several subjects at once will make the depth of knowledge shallow. Therefore, it is important to concentrate on one subject for each student’s competitiveness.
In addition, studying one subject can improve student’s concentration. When people study science and Korean, their brain works completely differently. A person’s brain needs time to adjust to the subject. If students keep changing the subjects, their brain will waste too much time trying to adapt. It is not efficient.
Some people argue to take classes in many subjects can make students do well in various fields. It is also important to experience various fields. However, access to various fields is different from the purpose of the university. The purpose of the university is to increase students’ expertise in their major. Therefore, specializing in major is the better than studying various areas.
To sum up, universities require students to specialize in their major for competitiveness of students and improving students’ concentration. Also, specializing in major is more suitable the purpose of university than studying various areas. It is essential to have a deep understanding of major knowledge to increase their value. Therefore, universities should provide students with the opportunity to acquire deep knowledge of their majors."	4	4	3.5	11.5

Currently, some universities require students to take classes only for one subject, while others require students to take classes for several subjects. In this situation, students will benefit from the experiences of taking various subjects for several reason.
First of all, studying multiple subjects can leads to fusion thinking. Study with theories from various subjects should be more creative and accurate research. Even subjects that seem irrelevant are often used in actual research; for instance, mathematics is also used when studying biology.
An additional reason is that careers of students can change while studying at university. Students should choose their major before entering university, despite the fact that the time to high school is not enough to determine their future. Furthermore, students may not be able to find a suitable major because they cannot learn specialized knowledge about each subject before university.
While it may be true that concentration on one subject decreases when students take multiple subject classes, it can be effective in view of long run. Studying only one subject for a long period of time can reduce interest; as a result, studying in various subjects can be positive effect on academics while maintaining interest and concentration in the major.
To sum up, universities should require students to take various subject classes for several reasons such as fusion thinking, suitable major, and interest of major; moreover, it will help students set their direction of careers and study about them. There is no doubt that studying multiple subjects is better choice for university students for long run."	4.5	4.5	4	13

Some universities have compulsory classes, which all students have to learn whatever major they choose. However, some people think that these classes are required; on the other hand, others prefer only taking classes in only one subject. In my opinion, it is better to require students to take classes from many subjects.
First, the required classes are courses which gives basic knowledge to students. School chooses a few classes that all students have to know whatever major they choose. For example, concepts learned in Calculus I are needed in most of the majors in KAIST, so it is a compulsory subject for freshman. Although these subjects are not forced to take, students should take to get information to learn higher level courses.
Moreover, students can meet friends from various majors by taking classes in many subjects. If everyone takes classes from one subject, then students can only meet students with same major in every class. They can only limited people with less variety of. Moreover, students have less chance to meet new people, and it will be hard to build new relationship in university.
It might be true that university students already decide their major, and they do not need to take other classes; however, taking various classes in university can be a chance to find new interest or major. Many students change their major in university. Taking various classes from various subjects gives help to students to find a new major.
To sum up, some universities has classes required on other subjects, while other universities does not. Having compulsory subjects has advantage in getting basic knowledge, meeting people with various interest, and having a chance of finding new major. Every school should have required subject to get these advantages."	4.5	4	4	12.5

As time passes, new kinds of knowledge is stored, new various fields of study appear, and technology develops. There are plenty of fields of study already these days, and more will appear in the future. With various areas of learning, some people think that students in universities are required to take classes in many subjects. However, in my opinion, it is better for students to specialize in one subject.
First of all, focusing on one subject make students to have much deeper knowledge about their major; therefore, they have more specialty and are more competitive in their fields. If people try to study many different fields, they tend to put less effort in each field and might not be able to gain expertise in almost every field. However, by studying one field, students have plenty of time to study it and are able to understand the subject much better.
In addition, studying one area is enough, and there is no need to study others. For example, biologists do not need to know about famous poets in history, and historians do not need to be good at calculus. In the future, people will have one job, and in most cases, one job doesn’t require various areas of knowledge and skills. It might be a waste of time to try to study various fields. It is rather better to focus on the thing that you are interested in and related to your future job.
It may be true that taking classes in many subjects can let students have various range of knowledge, and enable them to connect different fields. However, it may lead them to having only shallow knowledge of each field, and students might lack of expertise. They might not be competitive among people who are specialized in one thing; moreover, they might be uncapable of doing anything. Lack of professionalism can be a serious problem for them.
To sum up, although there are several benefits of taking many classes and earning knowledge from different fields, gaining deep knowledge and professionalism by specializing on one subject is important. With the development of technology and various areas of study, there are many choices these days. Rather than trying to study everything, people must find their aptitudes and specialize in that area to serve the society as an expert."	4	4.5	4	12.5

     Many of students will meet various kinds of subjects in the university. Some of universities require students to specialize in one subject. In my opinion, requiring students to take classes in many subjects is better than opponents for several reasons.
First of all, it is impossible to expect that this subject is appropriate to myself by only listening to some basic subjects. Most of university subjects are getting harder and being more professional as grade is increased. For example, if one student who wants to make vehicles decided to study Engineering subject, he will study complicated physics in higher grade. Students can not expect what they will study in future; it is dangerous to listen to only one subject.
   In addition to previous reason, students can create unexpected new ideas by hybrid of two ore more subjects. In nowdays, it is hard to find device that is only made with just one idea. For example, smartphone is an result of combining of electronic technology and art technology; as it is important to look beautiful. Most of devices are made with various technologies; therefore, if college students take classes in many subjects, they can improve ability to make more useful things in real life.
    Some argue that student who listen to many subjects will less professional than who is specialized in one subject. Actually, being professional in some field requires understanding of various subjects. For example, scientists study mechanical chemistry by physical method, which is called quantum physics; so students have to learn about that subject to understand mechanical chemistry.
    In conclusion, students have to take classes in many subjects and universities should require it. Although some people may think that taking just one subject is important to be professional, make sure to realize that society needs student who studied in various subjects; because student who is just professional in one field can not adapt in develop of technology."	4	3.5	3.5	11

Recently, the debate on the form of giving college education is rising. Some claim that every student should have the opportunity, on the other side, others declare that it should focus on the outstanding students. Despite the claims that a college or university education should be available to all students, it should be available only to good students. 
First of all, it is economically efficient to manage a small number of students. Financial support for college life is the surest way which helps students. Given that the expenditure on laptops and food is very high, it is natural that additional college financial support for students is made so that students can focus solely on learning. By considering the limited financing of school is distributed samely among the students, supporting a small number of students can provide sufficient or more support. 
In addition to economic efficiency, focusing on small numbers can cultivate elite leaders. The momentous person in the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution is a great leader, who leads the society. Usually, one of the factors related to the quality of learning is the number of students per professor. For example, in the case of general liberal arts lectures, as many as 300 students are taught by one professor; thus, the quality is naturally lower than that of one professor teaching to five students. Hence, teaching a small number of students, these situations will overlap, and in the end, individual students will have outstanding competencies.
Some argue that everyone has freedom of education, so they insist college or university education should be available to all students. It may be true that if no other form of education was considered. University is a place to create good talent, but it is not the only place to gain expert knowledge. Anyone can listen to public lectures such as K-mook, for example, and anyone with the will can obtain specialized knowledge of the university through educational services. 
To sum up, college education should be supported to a small number of talented students. This approach is more economically efficient than the way of educating everyone, and it can create strong talent. In addition to the university, there is also a window for the general public to listen to education, which prevents worry about when this method is implemented. Therefore, all university facilities will have to seriously consider the policy of raising a small number of elite students."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
510	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I think the universities that require students to take classes in many subjects are better.
I have three reasons for this opinion.

Firstly, students can learn more widely. Students who take classes in many subjects can learn other subjects either, which means they know and can think more widely. Knowing various things would make students themselves more efficient to live and easier to get their goals such as gaining more money through work.

Second reason is that the possibility of finding their real interests is higher. By learning various subjects, students can feel which subject is best for them. As students only lived about 20 years, they didn't try various things. For their left life, it is important to help students find their real interests.

Last reason is that students can meet more various people through various classes. For example let's say there is student A who only studies in Math and student B who studies in Math and Physics. Student A will meet small pool of students who studies Math(same as A) while student B meets more various people. Meeting various people sounds unimportant but it can actually wide your view of the world and make your world bigger. Also you can learn how to deal with people by meeting various people.

Some might agree with me while others don't. I think there is no answer because there are so many types of people in the world. Anyways if someone asks me the question 'Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better?' Then I will answer that I like the universities that require students to take classes in many subjects. Followed by three reasons; learn more widely, high possibility of finding real interest, chance to meet various people."	3.5	4	3.5	11
511	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"University in Korea teaches one specific subject except for the special university such as KAIST, GIST. Of course, I am KAIST student who learns many subjects in the first year, but  I think requiring students to specialize in one subject is  better system than the other one by several reasons. 
    The first reason is students don't need to study many subjects anymore. Most of the students learn many subjects in high school even though they don't want. High school students get grades from every single subjects and with those grades, they apply to the university. Almost every university that students apply teaches one specific subject such as chemistry, physics, and psychology. So I think it's time to let students to learn one specific subject and stop to learn unnecessary, unwilling subjects.
    The second reason why I think learning one subject is better is we can have much time to learn major subjects. Every college student in Korea have or will have a major and I think learning many subjects will make us busy learning major subjects. The main reason why we apply to the university is to learn our major and to achieve our dream in our field. So I think it's more effective to learn major earlier.
    Finally, the last reason is about the reason of the system. In fact, the system which require students to take classes in many subjects can be a great system because students can decide which subject they will pick. But in real world, many professors will teach their field shallow. The course from the high school and the university will be the same and actually the students will learn nothing new. Actually, this is the main reason why I think learning major earlier is the better idea because as I said, it will be a waste of time. I heard that there's few of students who change their major from senior.
    These were the reasons why I think universities that require students to specialize is the better one. There will be some disadvantages of the idea, of course, but the advantages are strong enough."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Some people might think that universities should require students to specialize in one subject. But that isn't true. I strongly claim that universities have to require students to take many subjects for 3 reasons.
  First of all, learning other subjects can also help understanding students' main courses. As people are emphasizing the importance of integrating subjects, other subjects are largely related to others. For example, while learning biology, we have to deal with catalyst. Catalyst is an chemical compound which help chemical reaction. It is really hard to understand without any chemistry background. If you study chemical and biology both, it will certainly help you understanding those terms.
  Secondly, it can help you to make some interest with other people. If we study various subject, we can grow our knowledge. It will help you to get some topic to talk with other people. You can't be sure that other people are studying the same main courses with you. So to make some small talk, studying various subjects is essential. For example, if you are studying chemistry and have to go meeting with art-university students, you can't make some topic to talk with. But if you were listening about history of art, then you can make more interesting topic to talk.
 At last, students can change their main courses. Actually, freshmen haven't study various subject, so they aren't sure about their interest at main courses. But if you try classes in many subject, you can experience other subjects and get some assurance in your courses or change to other things. For example, my high school was Korea Science Academy. It is just same as university, and they made students to try many subjects. When I first get in to my high school, I tried to study astronomy. But as I study other subjects, I kept being attracted to chemistry. Finally, I am trying to study chemistry. Like me, other students can change their main courses by experiencing various subjects.
  I strongly assert that universities should require students to study various subjects, because it can help understanding their main courses, it can help students talk with others, and it can help students to choose their main courses."	4	4	4	12

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"There are many types of universities. Some universities' curriculum make student to study about variety of subjects. Meanwhile, others make student to be specialize in one. There are pros and cons to each types, but I think for university students, to study about many subjects is better than to specialize in one subject.
  We should know that university students are mostly young. Also, most of them were always in the school before the university. They studied just for attending university, do not think seriously what they want is. It means, they did not study about what they want, since there were no choice for them. However, many of university make student to choose what to learn in university before they attend, and later, this choice mostly related to their job. I think it is too early to make a choice for student. Furthermore, mostly it is hard to remove the choice, or to learn other subjects. So it will be better to give students a chance to learn about many subjects. It is not late to make a choice after that, since the earlier choice could be bad for them.
  Moreover, in these days, connecting several subjects are useful. It can solve the problems that can not be solved before. To be specialize in two or more subjects could have larger opportunities than to be specialize in one. In other words, one person can make same result compare by many people combine, who are specialize in only one things. Studying many subjects, and be specialize in more than two subjects can be better. 
  Dreams can be change, and it is important to know what I am good at, or what I want is. To know this, we should try and try. Some might say it is not worth to spend a time for that. Maybe the first choice could be the best choice, but even that was proved by trying other things. We can do anything, and we should not limit ourselves."	3	3.5	3	9.5

However, before taking advanced classes about a root of a theory, why they use this formula, how he/she came up with this we've only learned about how to  solve questions quickly. A Korean high school student? They get forced to reach answers, to memorize stuffs, and to do calculations that computers can do. What I'm trying to say is that the depth and the purpose in a subject totally changes when you attend to university school. You might have loved solving Chemistry problems in high school, calculating and getting the answer but that doesn't mean that you're going to like it in university, too. More theories that you have to understand, you have to write essays and think about an experiment then execute you're plan. Which is complicating enough to change your favorite subject to the 'most hated'. Also, how can somebody know if they were meant to do that, unbelievably good at something without trying? Students, people need time, opportunities, and chances to find out what field fits them the most, what truly makes me happy when I do that, so in my opinion, choosing what subject to specialize in university, sounds a bit too early. Taking classes in many subjects is the real key for the first Korean Nobel prize winner because, before weaponize a 'strength', finding out the 'strength' and adopting to the changed circumstances are the priorities."	2	2	2.5	6.5
515	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I think that taking classes in many subjects is more helpful for students to study in university rather than specializing in one subject. There are few reasons supporting this idea.

 First, the knowledge that students learn in high school is too wide and shallow. In public education, students learn many subjects starting from math and science to English and Korean. However, not all students are talented in all of these subjects. So, to study together, school have to teach only basic concepts. For example, if one student can't understand some concept well, teacher can not teach other concept and have to explain again for that student. But students need deeper knowledge to study in professional field and to stand alone in society. Thus, the university have to teach deeper basic knowledge to student. And it will be easier to teach since the students are grouped with similar education level in university.

 Second, all subjects are connected and basis in other subjects helps studying one subject. All of the subjects in similar area share similar theory or applied together in industry. For this reason, studying other subjects in similar area may help understanding better in your main subject and creating new idea or items in industry. For example, all the students in KAIST have to learn general chemistry, physics and biology. Learning physics may help understanding and explaining the movements and interactions of molecules in chemistry. And also, learning chemistry can help understanding the biomolecules and  reactions in living creatures. Also, knowledge in many basic science areas should be combined to develop modern technology. So we can't avoid to study in many fields to develop modern technology.

 Even KAIST, which is the university leading the science and technology requires students to learn many subjects in basic science. For these reasons I think universities should require students to take classes in many subjects, not only in their major area, but also in other basic subjects."	3.5	4	3.5	11

"As there are thousands of universities worldwide and each university has each own way to teach students, there are thousands, milllions of univesity education policy. Some universities make students to take classes in many subjects, while others want students to be specialized in one subject. For my opinion, I believe it's better to take classes in many subjects.

First, lets say there is a student who is interested in both chemical engineering and economics. If the student has been  acceptted to colledge to major chemicel engineering. If the university requires student to specialize only in one subject, he wouldn't have a chance to study economics even if he really wants to study it. Making students to take classes in many subjects can solve this problem. Students will be able to study as many subjects as they want. 

Second, it can help students whose favor of subject changed from one to another. If the colledge makes student to be specialized in one subject, he would have hard time studying subject that does not suit him. But if the university requires students to take classes in many subjects, he can simply solve the problem by taking more class from the subject he newly favors. This kind of education policy at univesity can help students to enjoy studying the subject they newly get interested. 

Third and finally, if universities require students to take classes in many subjects, student can have broader view while studying. A student who only learned chemistry would view science only through the view of chemistry. But if the student studied other subjects too, those subjects each will give an eye to veiw science in different ways. A unsolving problem in chemistry might be easy to solve using  ideas from physics or biology. in 1930s while quantom mechanics were born, physics had problem finding out how electrons were acting. When they showed the problem to mathematicians, they solved it through existing theory in linear algebra. Like this, knowing about many subjects, can help us solve problems in science.

This is the reasons why I believe universities require students to take classes in many subjects better than making students to be specialized in one subject. Undergraudate courses is just a one small step into the real world of science.  Undergraudate  should study different studjects, and widen their view and then, when they go to graudate school, they will have chance to be specialized in one subject."	2	2.5	2	6.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I assist that requiring students to take classes in many subjects is better than specializing in one subject. There are three big reasons why I thought this way. I focused on the point that a university is an educational place for young people who graduated high school.

First of all, since the university is a place to study for youngs, so students should try many subjects and different ways. At university, they can be taught by intellectual professors and learn more deeply than before. Specializing only one subject is not a good way for them when they have many chances to attempt. Specializing and devoting to one subject can be done when they graduate the university and they work at their job.

Second, the world is globalizing, so every subject is connected altogether. So they need to know some parts and get used to it even though that might not be their major. Like what I said above, absorbing diverse information as much as they can in their university and then use them on their major will be a better choice than blocking their way when they are young. Combined knowledge and ideas from the classes they took in the university will make their major works more effective and high quality in the future.

Lastly, I think that a university student is a good period to dive into many opportunities in studying.  If they have a chance to dig into numerous subjects, then they should go for it. Their selected major can be changed whenever and wherever since they are still young to know everything about it. Trying will help them to choose and get close to what they really want to do and good at. Learning more deeply at college than they did in high school might change their mind and find a whole new way in their life. 

So, according to those three examples, I argue that taking classes in numerous subjects at university is such a better way than requiring them to study one subject."	3.5	3	3	9.5
519	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"  In Korea, many universities require students to specialize in one subject such as Seoul University. However, some universities, such as KAIST require students (freshmen) to take classes in many subjects. In this case, I think students should specialize in one subject. 

   First of all, the academic requirements to be a specialist goes higher as time passes, and students need to concentrate more to achieve it. In the past, computer science was only about algorithms and computer languages, not artificial intelligence. People who wanted to be a computer scientist in the past didn't have to study about hard stuff such as AI. In these days, they have to. It is getting harder and harder to achieve one thing. Making students to study another thing will only confuse them. 
   Secondly, there are many subjects we don't use in our real life. What is the use of the history of classic music to the person who wants to be a chemist? Like this, students are wasting time for subjects they will never use in the future. If they use that time in a more useful way, such as studying main subjects or taking a rest, it will bring more positive result in their career.
   Third, it may make students passive. Taking many subject means students cannot specialize their timetable with certain subject. Rather than choosing their own subjects and timetables, students will only think about subjects they have to take, and setting timetables without their own will.  

   Of course, it is a good thing for students who haven't chosen their main subject to take classes in many subject. However, when students decide what they want to learn, taking many subjects will only disturb students from that period. For these reasons, I think students should specialize in one subject."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

"I think everybody admits that the balance between work and life is critical, but I'm not really sure if people know the importance of balance inside the work. I am currently listening to 7 subjects, and some of my friends are listening to even more. There is absolutely no problem, because I agree on the importance of studying diverse subjects. Several years ago, our country announced a new education philosophy called STEAM. I can't recall what it's short for exactly, but I can remember that the education will teach students not only on few chosen subjects, but covering up all boundaries including, science, math, art, P.E., literature and etc. The country wanted us to take a look in many subjects because it provides us with more useful knowledge, gives us a new extra point of view.
If a student specializes on one subject, the student will probably become an expert in that category. He/She'll be better on tasks which only includes the subject the student specialized on. However, in most of the cases, that is not what tasks are made up of. For example, in order to understand how humans digest food and turn into particles that our cells can use, which is within the boundaries of biology, it is necessary to know the process of how molecules react with others. As you can tell, majority of the people will say this knowledge is chemistry. In order to master on one subject, it is essential to study other subjects.
By studying many subjects there are more benefits than the extra knowledge. Our brains can refresh while moving on to an  another subject. Sometimes, the subjects can provide us with much wider perspective. Last week when I took the first class of physics at KAIST, the professor told us that physics are lying beneath every science subject and that is why it is important to learn it. Which I partly agree. Quantum physics is a part of physics, but doesn't follow the common rules of physics. Looking in a mathematical or computing view, it is much easier to understand and break down the problems. This is proof that we need more than just one perspective.
As the world is evolving and the science, technology is evolving together, people need to learn the ability to gather up information from many different subjects. That is why students need to take classes in many subjects, not focusing on just one.."	3.5	3	4.5	11

First, student's knowledge can be used more practical after graduation when they study in various areas. After graduation, whatever what jobs will students select, there are no jobs which  requires only one type of ability. Students have to get trained by studying the abilities which they need to accomplish their dreams. 
  Second, minority of people decides their dream when they enroll the university. So, for students who are getting trouble with what they really want to do,  universities have responsibility for help them to solve the problem. For them, studying only one subject at least 4 years is discarding time. 
  At last, nevertheless the student loves specific subject so much, he will get losed to the subejct when he has to study only about that subject for 4-5 years. It will be suffer when students get a duty to study uninteresting classes rather than interesting classes. 
 For these reasons, universities which require students to take classes in many subects is better than universities which require students to specialize in one subject."	2	2.5	3	7.5

 First, I think the purpose of university is to make a student specialized in one subject. I believe the reason why there are so many colleges and departments in university is to accept students who want to major in different subjects. To meet the purpose of university, university should require students to specialize in one subject.
 Second, students already studied many subjects in high school even though they are not interested in. In my case, I'd like to major in computer science. In order to go to university and study computer science, I studied chemistry and biology even if they are not directly related with computer science and not in my interest. As an award for students who have studied many subjects in high school, university should give students opportunity to study and specialize in subject that they want to.
 Third, focusing in one subject will be better in means of achievement than covering many subjects. To study many subjects and prepare for test, students need to make plan how to study and have to make a strategy for test. It gives students a lot of stress and I believe it's not an essence of learning. On the other hand, if students are required to specialize in one subject, they could fully concentrate in learning and make an academic success.
 As a conclusion, I argue that universities should require students to specialize in one subject by three reasons; to meet the purpose of university, to give students opportunity to be a specialist in one subject, and to have students achieve an academic success."	3	3.5	3	9.5

Although both are important, I think taking diverse classes in many subjects is more important. 
  First, learning various subjects makes students good researchers or workers. Because of 4th industrial revolution, barriers between many academic areas are becoming ambiguous. Almost every finding are based on combinations. In this era, students should know a variety of subjects. 
  Second, it gives students the capacity to innovate. A lot of innovations are created by combining different academic fields. For example, Steve Jobs was able to make innovations by combining computer, mobile phone, and art. If a student learns just a single subject, he/she is less likely to combine 'diverse' field.
  Last but not least, taking diverse classes in many subjects makes students live well with many people. Because of globalization, people of many different cultures are living together. A wide perspective is essential to living together. Learning many different areas gives many different perspectives, so it is necessary.
  Of course, being a specialist by learning a single area is also nice. But this century requires a person who knows diverse fields. Since it is irreversible trend, universities should require students to take classes in many subjects."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

In my opinion, universities which give students the opportunity to take classes in many subjects are better than the ones which require students to specialize in one subject. I have two main reasons to support my opinion.
 First, it is hard for students to choose just one subject. If students are required to specialize in one subject, students must choose a major. And after selecting it, it will be really hard to change it. However, after graduating high school, students  don't know about themselves and may choose wrong subjects. Students should be given the time and chance to find their dream and goals, since they were too busy studying to find it in high school.
 Second, Learning many subjects will give a lot of common knowledge and flexibility of thoughts. Students will be able to have diverse opportunities and experiences by learning a variety of subjects. This will lead students to think and act more flexibile.
 In conclusion, I think universities should give students the opportunity to take classes in many subjects rather than requiring students to specialize in one subject by two supporting reasons."	2	2.5	2.5	7
526	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Today, a lot of universities require students to attend various classes. They claim that taking many classes helps students to be a great researcher, CEO, etc. However, my opinion is different. Only concentrating on one classes is the best way to influence the world. There are two points that support my opinion; concentration, and payback.
 First of all, taking lots of classes make students lose their concentration on their major works. While studying or doing homework for other classes, it's not easy for student to develop their major skills. I had a experience related to it when I was a high school second grade student. At that time, I decided to be a chemist and was preparing for Chemistry Olympiad test. But there was a lot of homework for economy class which is not related to my major. So I could not fully concentrate on Olympiad test. As a result, I failed the test. If I had studied only chemistry, I would have passed the test!
 Second, even in one major, there are so many things to learn. As the time passed, it's difficult to be a expert, who knows all the things about certain subject, because people study more and more and find something new. So people who want to be an expert have to only concentrate on their major. But why do we should be an expert? As you know, the more difficult it is, the more peaceful it is. Few experts in a certain area earns not only money but also respect from people.  
 Some people who have opinions that are against to me can ask that succeed CEO, like Steve Jobs, had attended various classes when he was a university student. However, attending a lot of classes is not highly related to him to be a great CEO. Fully concentrating on his laptop work after he graduated, had changed his life.  
 Because of concentration and payback, I prefer to specialize in one subject. Maybe taking various classes and having lots of experiences are joyful things. However, to change the world, you need to be a specialized person.  "	3	3	3	9

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I think everybody admits that the balance between work and life is critical, but I'm not really sure if people know the importance of balance inside the work. I am currently listening to 7 subjects, and some of my friends are listening to even more. There is absolutely no problem, because I agree on the importance of studying diverse subjects. Several years ago, our country announced a new education philosophy called STEAM. I can't recall what it's short for exactly, but I can remember that the education will teach students not only on few chosen subjects, but covering up all boundaries including, science, math, art, P.E., literature and etc. The country wanted us to take a look in many subjects because it provides us with more useful knowledge, gives us a new extra point of view.
If a student specializes on one subject, the student will probably become an expert in that category. He/She'll be better on tasks which only includes the subject the student specialized on. However, in most of the cases, that is not what tasks are made up of. For example, in order to understand how humans digest food and turn into particles that our cells can use, which is within the boundaries of biology, it is necessary to know the process of how molecules react with others. As you can tell, majority of the people will say this knowledge is chemistry. In order to master on one subject, it is essential to study other subjects.
By studying many subjects there are more benefits than the extra knowledge. Our brains can refresh while moving on to an  another subject. Sometimes, the subjects can provide us with much wider perspective. Last week when I took the first class of physics at KAIST, the professor told us that physics are lying beneath every science subject and that is why it is important to learn it. Which I partly agree. Quantum physics is a part of physics, but doesn't follow the common rules of physics. Looking in a mathematical or computing view, it is much easier to understand and break down the problems. This is proof that we need more than just one perspective.
As the world is evolving and the science, technology is evolving together, people need to learn the ability to gather up information from many different subjects. That is why students need to take classes in many subjects, not focusing on just one.."	3	3.5	4	10.5
528	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Nowadays, there are lots of subjects that we can learn in universities. There is society, science, mathematics, language, and so on. We have a chance to experience different kinds of subjects. However, I think universities should require students to specialize in one subject. 
 First, specializing in one subject is better when we get a job. In companies, people don't have to do all the jobs. The jobs are divided into several parts. For example, let's say there's a company which make robots. Some workers make robots while other workers program the robots to move. So, the company doesn't need a worker who knows both technologies. The company will want a person who is specialized in just making or programming. 
 Second, specializing in one subject is better for the university students when studying. All the subjects are not the same. They teach different things. So, if we take classes in many subjects, there will be subjects that a student won't like. Then the student will have a hard time listening to the subject. For instance, there was a friend in my highschool who only liked physics. In our highschool, we learn various subjects in the first grade. Then we specialize in one subject in the second and third grade. In the first year, my friend had lots of stress on studying biology and chemistry, because he didn't like these subjects. And in the second year, my friend specialized in physics, and he said to me that school became easier and more interesting. 
 As a result, I think universities must require students to specialize in one subject. It is better when we try to get a job, and when students study at the university. When a university let students work hard on a subject he or she wants, students will have a better life in campus and the society.    "	3	3.5	3	9.5
529	Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"I prefer to spend time with one or two close friends for several reasons.
 One is that it is hard  for me to communicate with person that doesn't have same interests. People often talk about where they did go on weekend, or delicious liquors, or games that are popular, such like that. But I'm mainly interested in quite strange things, such as school study, or games that isn't popular, etc. So, it is hard to find  people has same interests with me, so when I spend time with friends, I find a few of friends that have same interests with me; therefore, I spend time with a few friends.
 The second reason is that I feel uncomfortable when many people focus on me. This is my character from when I was a child. In lunch time at school, I spent time in classroom or libraries, when others play soccer in playground. I merely experienced to spend time with many friends, so It is hard to stay with many people for me.
 At last, I don't have many friends. As mentioned before, I like to stay alone and focus on what I'm really interested, so I don't have enough time to make friends. So I have a small number of friends; therefore I hang out with small number of friends.
 In summary, I like to spend time with a small number of friends that have same interests with me."	1.5	2	2.5	6

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"I prefer to spend time with a large number of friends, not with one or two friends because of 3 reasons.

First, larger group can make more communication. I prefers to talk a lot when I meet friends, but it is hard to do when I meet one or two friends because there is less topics to talk. However, when I meet lots of friends in one place, each person has their own topics to talk so there are many topics to talk together as a result. That means it is better to join a larger group for a talk.

Second, we can do or choose more activities to do together. When I met one or two friends, we always go to PC-room or coin garaoke. It's because other activities are hard to enjoy by 2 or 3 person. However, I can play games that more than 4 people is needed, go to garaoke that is large, play board games that needs many people, and etc when I met many friends. Also, there are more choices of restaurant when I met more friends. As a summary, more choices are added when I met more friends. So it is better to meet more friends.

Lastly, I prefers a larger group because it is easy to meet with one  or two friends, but hard to meet with a large group. Each person has their own schedule, so it is hard to meet all friends in one day. However, meeting one or two friends is not so hard because we only need to consider one or two schedules. So if there's a chance to meet many friends, I would choose larger groups to meet.

Because of these reasons, I prefer to spend time with a large number of friends than one or two close friends. Sadly, it is impossible to meet a large number of friends in now days, so I hope the pandemic ends soon."	3.5	4	3.5	11

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Time is fixed, therefore, it is precious and we should consume it wisely throughout our life. For this reason, I prefer to spend time with my two-three close friends. I have provided two reasons to explain my position.
   To begin with, more people means more opinions. It is hard to compromise and get everybody's satisfaction to do something in a group. For instance, when you are in a company of ten people and you are planning to gather at weekend to watch a movie. Because everybody has his/her own taste, it is difficult to choose a movie. Usually, such a group of people just waste 2-3 hours of their time just trying to find a movie that everybody approves of. Even though they find the amazing movie, there is a chance that someone might have watched it already. This period is just a waste of your time.
    Let's think about the advantages of a small group. I would say, it is their mobility. For example, a small group can take one taxi and still talk between each other as a whole, because they are only 3-4 people at all. For example, during summer vacation and two of my close friends traveled around Korea. Starting from seats at taxi to places around a table at Korean restaurants are dedicated to the small groups. Whenever you take a selfie or group photo, there a few people and more places to show the background(nature, statue, or city). Lastly, especially now, it is not allowed to gathere more than five people.
    All in all, spending time with a small group has at least two advantages such as finding compromise more quickly and moving around faster."	3	3	3.5	9.5
532	Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"During free time, somebody loves to spend his time with a large group of friends because it is more enjoyable when he stay with a large number of people. However, I prefer spending my time with only few friends. There are three reasons why I prefer spending time with only one or two friends.

First of all, I am an introvert. People with this personality prefer to stay alone rather than staying with a large group of people. I feel more comfortable to spend my time alone or with only one or two close friends because we are close enough to understand each other without explaining too much. I also found it more relax and peaceful to stay with as small number of people as possible.

Furthermore, I feel exhausted when I have to be among a large number of people because I lose my energy to this environment. I have to pretend to be kind and nice to each person which is very uncomfortable to me. Sometimes, I also have to pretend to enjoy some group activities even if I did not enjoy those situations.

Finally, the activities I would like to do in my free time are more suitable for small groups of people. For example, I like reading books in coffee shop, and this hobby does not need a large number of people. On the other hand, I don't like activities that require a large group of people such as team sports and party.

To summarize, I prefer spending my time with one or two close friends rather than staying with a large group of people because of my personality type and my hobby preference. For these reasons, I feel more comfortable and less exhausted when I stay with a small number of people."	3	4	4	11
533	Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"We meet a lot of friends when we do some social works. You may think about the difference in friendship with every friend. Few of them can be thought as your best friends, and the others are not. In this situation, people have two type of spending time with them. That is, people who spend time with one or two close friends or a large number of friends. Although I know two way of them has each pros and cons, but I prefer to have time with one or two close friends.

First, you can make decision easily.
Let's think about one situation. You have to choose what to eat for your lunch. In this situation, if you are with a large number of friends, decision will be hard and take a lot of time. In the worst situation, you can't decide your lunch for a long time. However, if you spend time with only one or two friend, this decision will be easier. We can choose one menu in two cartegories. The kind of menu is smaller, and it is easier to make decision between two.

Next, you can make social bond easily.
If we spend time with a lot of friends, it can make corruption, or smaller group between you and your friends. When you make big group with your friends, in that group, you can feel difference in friendship with your friends. However, if you spend time with one or two friend, it won't be happened. That's because of social bond. You can share more information with your very close friends even if you private information. It will make your relationship with friends better.

Lastly, it's easier to manage your friend.
When you make your friend's birthday party, you have to remember your friends' birthday. And as you know, when you have to memorize a lot of information, it can be very hard work. This means it is hard to manage all of your friends. Otherwise, if you spend time with one or two friends, managing information of your friends will be easier. Because of less amount of information, you can memorize the information much easier. And the result of this, you can give more precise gift, or more memorizable event for their birthday party.

Today, I've said you about my preference of spending time with friends including three reasons; easier to make decision, can make social bond easily, have pros in managing friends. Spending time with a large number of your friends will be good to make more relationship, but I think spending time with one or two close friends can make your friendship more stronger. How about calling your very close friend to spend time this weekend?"	3.5	4	3.5	11
534	Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"  When people have some leisure time to spend with their friends, they choose their own style individually. Although some people choose to spend time with a large number of friends, others prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. If choosing in these two direction, I prefer to spend time with one or two close friends with three big reasons.
  First, it is  easier to gather opinion of each friends. The community life is started when we meet friends. People consider each friends' opinion for every activities. For examples, we cannot determine ourselves what food to eat for lunch, what game we play, and where we go. We should gather each opinion in one direction to satisfy everyone. However, when we spend time with a large groups, there are so many opinions that each one supports.  On the other side, when we met one or two close friends, since the number of opinions are little, the time that wondering about what to do, what to eat, where to go are decreased. Therefore, they can spend time more efficiently.
  Second, there are more thing to do when we meet close friends only. When we spend time with a large group, activities that join everyone are limited. In fact, major activities that university students easily do with their friends outside are eat out, go to singing room, watch movie. Although there are some places that can accepted large groups, activities that large group can enjoy are limited than small group. In addition, since most of restaurant is ready for 4-persons table, the selection of places to eat out are increase.
  Third, the way that spending time with close friends allows easy to measure appointment. In large groups, each person have their schedules, so find leisure time to meet together is difficult. However, when we meet small member of friends, it is more easier to check each schedules. Moreover, we can measure appointment only call friends before the day, or in the morning in small groups, but it is impossible in large groups that everyone are not free at any time.
  I talked about why I prefer to spend time with one or two close friends than with a large number of friends above three big reasons. Each persons have each life-styles, so their style to play are different. I hope you will choose the way that proper for yourself, and enjoy time."	3.5	4	3	10.5
535	Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Sometimes, many people want to play their time with their friends. Someone wants to spend time with one or two close friends, and other people want to spend time with many friends. In this topic, I argue that spending time with one or two people is more good for us. There are three reasons about my thought.

First, spending time with low-closed friends makes you more comfortable than large people. Sometimes, we are alone in many people even if you are not shy and having funny time with them. Because, just spending time and talking with many people cannot make you comfortable. While you spend time with many friends, you should be more careful than low-closed friends because of your behavior. In this reason, spending time with low-closed friends makes you more comfortable than large people.

In additional, playing with low number of close friends make you funny without any stress or ready. If you want to get funny times, you can just meet your close friends, and take a funny(but not useful) talking-time or take your own spending-times way with your close friends. Than you can just feel very funny without any other behavior or to try.

Last, this time can give you good signals in your closed-friendships. Spending your time with low numbers of closed friends can give you good thought about your closed friends, and it can make relationships harder than before. And, it also encourage you to be great-closed friends to them. It can help you any difficult times. 

In this lecture, spending time with low-closed friends makes you more comfortable, makes you funny without any stress or behavior, and makes your closed-friendships harder. Because of these three reasons, I argue that spending time with one or two close friends is more good for us."	3	3.5	2.5	9

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Some people prefer to spend time with a large number of friends. I guess that they like the crowdness when people gather, and they feel they have lots of friends, so they get relaxed and happy. However, there is three reasons that hanging out with a small number of close friends is better than many friends.
 Most of all, I can make deeper friendship when I spend time with close friends. According to my experiences, when the number of group exceeds 6 or 7, there is always more than one person that I feel not close to him or her. It is okay when I hang out within a group including them, but I get too shy soon when I just left with them.  Otherwise, when I hang out with my closest friend or friends, I don't need to worry about what I should talk about or what I should play with. The relationship between us become deeper because I spend time with them more and more.
 Next, we can make decisions easier. It is easy to decide between only 2 choices like Jjajangmyon and Jjampong, but as the number of group gets bigger and the number of choices increases, making decision gets much harder. This can occur in many situations like ""Where should we go from now?"" or ""Who will sing first?"" However, if there are two or three people and we are in multiple-answer situation, we have lesser choices. All of us agree with someone or only one of us suggests another answer; but, in the case that one of us disagree with major decision, it is obvious that we spend lesser time to decide than larger groups. We can spend more time in order to saving time for making decisions.
 Finally, we can do more activities. Most of 20s men enjoy playing games. However, every game limits the number of people that can enjoy together in the same time. League of Legends, the most popular game with us, limits 5 people, so if the group member is not multiple of 5, they should seperate in 2 or more groups and enjoy it. However, 2-3 people can enjoy almost all games together. Also, 2,3-membered groups have no limitation on social distancing. We can hang out during the COVID outbreak.
 To conclude, we can make deeper friendship, spend small time to decide, and do lots of activities if we spend time with small number of friends. I think 2 close friends is much better than 100 not so close friends."	4	4	4	12

""If you want to understand someone, just look at his friends."" This iconic saying says importance of having good friends. Maintain connection with friends makes you look like him, and you and your friends' behavior also become same. In this situation, connect with good friends can be a way to grow myself as a kind and nice person.
As this questions says, there are two kind of people in the earth. Some of them prefer to spend time with few close friends, while others wants to spend time with many friends. In this situation, if I can only choose on of them, I will choose second way. I think spending time with many person can give better effect for me.
Let me give you some example. One boy was born in old town, and he had few friends in his school. Unluckily, his few friends were son of gang boss. So, he gain bad effects from his few friends and joins bad gang. This can be a bad situation. If you choose bad friends, spending a lot of time only with them can be a dangerous situation. Another boy was born in same town and he graduated the same school with the boy that I mentioned. He liked to spend his time with a lot of friends, so he knew smart friends, baseball player friends, gang friends, etc. By having a large connection with them, he can knew how the world works and can think ""I should not join some bad gangs"". Such as his case, spending time with many person can make you avoid situation that you can be in danger.
As we can see in this example, I prefer spending my time in meeting many friends. I think it is too dangerous to have only few friends when they are bad person.
The second reason why we have to make many friends is creativity. We are studying in the university of engineering. When I meet friends who studying in university of art, education, etc, I can think they are much more creative then me. This is because the way of thinking between them are different. When we meet few friends, we can only see the few ways of thinking. However, if we meet many friends, we can see a lot of ways to understand some situation. This connection can give us inspiration to solve our problems. In fact, a lot of scientific discovery was effected by similar situation. Maintain connection with a lot of people can make you a creative person. So we have to make many friends.
The last reason why we have to make many friends is to avoid loneliness. We are not teenagers now, and we are getting older and older. Some friends can be sick sometimes. In that hard situation, friends' help can bring huge happiness for sick person. If we have few friends, there's some limits that we can helped by them. However, if we have many friends, we can helped a lot by them. The huge happiness be brought by them can be a force to win in the battle with sickness. 
For these three reasons, I prefer spending times with many friends then spending time with only few friends. Having a lot of friends can give you happiness, and you can avoid bad situations easily."	3	2	3.5	8.5
539	Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"  There are many debates of how many friends are best while spending the time.  some people say  spending one or two friends is better and some people say spending time with a large of friends is better. For my decision, I neither prefer both of the options. To talk about the reasons why I don't prefer neither of the options, the essay will tell about the reasons why the each options is bad.

  First, spending time with one or two close friends is a bad option, because it makes people dependent to the friends who are meeting with and if there is the disaster which made you miss one of the friends, the disaster will make a huge trauma. Giving the examples for the previous sentences, while I had been had a good time with my  friend at high school,  By the disaster I had missed  a friend. Because of that, I had still had difficulty while making a new friends. Afterward, even though I had made a new friend,  I was depending on my friends, which had given a negative affect to me and my friends.

  Second, spending time with the large number of friends is a quite worse option, because If you spend time with a large number of people, it must be made a people who is not well-connected, which makes that people to become a lonely people, for example, while I was in another-college, I had tried to join a group which was a big group, additionally, I tried to be friendly as best as I can, however, because I didn't had the good communication skills nor topic which majority enjoy, I was naturally become lonely again. 

  Additionally, having time with a large amount of people can hurt your mind. For example, when I was in high school, I had a people who eventually hated me,  he had said a  bad words about me,  I couldn't escape high school or do something which helped me, because to come to KAIST or other college, I had to graduate the high school. Additionally, that people had a high communication skills and various topic which majority of people enjoy, which made that people become friendly to majority of the group. 

  In conclusion, even though there are many debate about the number of friends which makes the spending time together, I couldn't say neither of the options was preferred to me. Even though I meet with friend who had meet during middle school sometimes, negative side  of each option seem huge to me even to hide the positive side of the both options. Even though, I believe that there is a positive side that I couldn't find. I wish that other people who are reading this essay could find a positive side of both options and make a good friendship."	4	4	4	12

I also make relationship with some people in EFL English camp or same club.
According to my feeling about relationship with KAIST people for 1 year, I perhaps prefer spending time with a large number of friends than one or two close friends. there are several reasons for my thinking.

First of all, among a large number of friends, there are person who can become my best-friend. It is on one's own whether play with a small number of people or play with a large number of people. but spending time with big group is necessary to make new friends because almost every first event of people in society is spending time with many people. By play or working with many people, we can make true friends. that is, spending time with a large number of friends can increase probability of making best friends.

Second, we can feel another enjoyment by spending time with a large number of friends. If you play game in the big group, you often think there are different point with small group game. In the KAIST, many people who don't like drink beer or wine would go to place that selling beer or wine because they like mood and enjoyment by spending time with big group.

Finally, spending time with a large number of friends will make more interaction between other people. Increasing interaction make expanding relationship and chance to approach new information. So spending time with a large number of friends is good chance for future.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"I'm not a type of people who spend time with a large number of friends, but I would say I prefer it than to spend time with one or two close friends.
 Why? First, it is very likely that people who spend time with few close friend is not able to get various opinions or experiences. To live better, in my opinion, you should know more about how the world is working or have a creative and open mind. And to do so, it is helpful to meet other people.
 Second, if you only spend time with few close friends, you might lose a chance to get to know who do fit with you more. For example, I have a few friends in KAIST. I met one of them in the class meeting in 2020. If I spent time with few friends, not joining the class meeting, then I wouldn't know him. However I did join the meeting, talk with him, and I realized he and I have similar preference. Again, If I were a type of who play with few friends, I might lose this chance.
 Someone might think of more reasons, but two reasons above are why I prefer a large number of friends."	2	2.5	2	6.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Because of COVID-19, we can't meet our friends face-to-face easily as before. So, many people hope that they can spend time with a lot of people as soon as possible. But, some people think one or two close friends are enough to spend their time. Today, I'm going to talk about why I agree with the topic, spending time with one or two friends is better than a large number of friends, with several reasons.
First of all, it is too annoying to enjoy talking with your friends when you're with many people. For example, we can't notice what our friend says in the concert hall or festival. We must get close to his ear to talk to our friends. A large number of people will interrupt your talking all the time. Thus, one or two people is enough to share your thinking with.
Moreover, many people don't keep concentrating on your talking. There is a famous joke in Korea, ""I feel like such as I'm talking to the wall."" It means if your talking partner is not concentrate on your talking, it is same as you are talking to yourself. As I mentioned before, when you're with many people, your friends can't concentrate on you easily because it's too loud. Also, because many people are there, they are likely to talk each other than you. One of the biggest reasons why you spend your time with your friends is sharing your experiences and feeling. If you can't, then I think it's better to spend your time alone. Hence, I think talking with a small number of people are better than talking with a large number of people.
In conclusion, I think small number of people are enough to spend time with. With too many people, they can't concentrate on you and even you can't talk to your friends easily. Sharing our opinions and feelings is very important thing in your life. I hope you think about this topic because it's very familiar topic to us."	2.5	2.5	3	8
543	Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Most people try to make friends when they met new group like school or office. This is because they can hang out, help each other and overcome the problem with their friends. So, friends are necessary for us to live in this society. However, I cannot agree with that many friends are important. I think that only few close friends is better than large number of friend with some reasons and own experience.
 For my case, I only can talk my private event to my close friend. Discuss my own problem is one of the best rule of friend for me. When I was young, only reason what I want to do with my friend is just hang out. So, the number of friends I had is related to number content with them. But, nowadays the rules of friend are changed. I usually talking about their life. My friends want to talking their own serious problem and discuss with me. Sometimes, they cry during talking about it. All people want to telling own thought and emotion honestly. But, it's not easy, if the are not close. So, building a close relationship is important.
 Other important reason is that close friend has similar thought. For my case, my friends has very similar characteristic, similar opinion, similar  clothes or food favor, and even similar height. It makes easily understand each other. if there are couple that didn't fit each other, the group is easily break down.For example, I met new friends at KAIST. One of my close friend has interested in  computer game. So we play a lot. Moreover, we has similar interest about the chemistry. So the time to asking the question from the lecture or task is increased. We help academically a lot.
 There are some reasons why I prefer to spend close friends. I can talk my private thing and has similar thought. So, I want to build more deep relationship with few friends."	3	3.5	3	9.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"  People are social animal which like to spend time with each others, and there are many types of ways to spend time with people. Some people like spending their time with large group of people, such as party or sports. Or, some other people like to spend their time with just small group of people who they really close to them. However, I prefer to spend time with small numbers of people rather than large numbers of people, and there are some reasons that I act like that. First of all, I think I should pay attention to opponent when I talk or interact to, but if I spend time with large numbers of people, then I can not spend enough attention to opponent in my policy. Second, I think interact with large numbers of people in parallel is sometimes frustrating experience. And lastly I think I am not good to manage relationship in large scale of group. Let me talk about them in detail.

  First, I think I should pay attention to opponent when I talk to him or her. It is taken as a polite behavior to pay attention to the person who talk to you in general, and paying attention is a great way to show respect to the person. Thus, I think I have to pay an enough attention and show the respect to the person as I am being a human being. But if I work with the large group of people, such as over 10 people, then I usually lost or miss the some context for some people. It makes me feels bad. Moreover, if I was an opponent, I will be happy to be paid attention to my conversation and words.

  Secondly, sometimes the large group of people make me tired. In the world, there are so many kind of people, who have different nation, age, gender, study, and even jobs. So if I spend my time with large group, inevitably, I will encounter people who are not fit my thinking and behaviors. However I always try to pay respect to everyone I can, if there are those kind of people, they will consume my mental power harshly. Therefore I do not prefer spending time with large number of people.

  Lastly, it is pretty hard to keep and grow relationship with large number of people. People are so various and there is no one who is same as me. Thus, keeping relationship with the people and understanding the people requires a lots of effort. However, it is pretty great work to understand my friends and spend time with the friends. Because I want to make more people who can deeply understand my thinking and whom I can understand, I do my best to interact and understand with others. But as much as the numbers of people is increased, the complexity of working with the relationship is exponentially increased. Sometimes this make me frustrated. So I do not prefer spend a long time with the large numbers of people.

  In conclusion, I like to keep the relationship that can deeply understand each other. This point of view makes me work with relatively small numbers of people, and it makes me spend time with them more. The smaller numbers of people allows me to be able to show my respect to them better, and understand each other, and it is efficient to work with social group. I am happy that I can do social activity in this pattern successfully, however, I understand there are different types of people who likes large number of people or do not like people. Humans are interesting, and there are no answer to solve this problem."	3.5	4	3.5	11

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"    I think that we need to spend time with a large number of friends. Also, you can make specially close one or two friends. But if you spend your time with only one or two friends, It will be disadvantage.  
     First of all, it is good for your life meeting many kind of people. If you have some close friends, you can know only some kind of life. I think that people grow with many experience. So, making large friends will move your insight more board. For example, I graduated at science high school. And most of my friends are good at science or math. When I met other friends whose major is English or Korean,  I did not know how to start speak.
     Second, if you have only one or two friends, when you want to spend your extra time, they may not have time to spend with you. Everyone has each schedule.  If you make free time and find your friends who have same free time with you, it is very big advantage that you know a lot of friends that you can call. In campus, I know only 5 people. So I sometimes eat lonely.
     Finally, you should spend time with a lot for friends to grow social ability. Social in Korea want the social ability. Social ability means that the ability about how to you make to friends are felt friendly. Especially in Korea,  firm want you can spend time with all of their members. So it will be very important ability when you want to find firm.
     In summary, you have to spend with many friends because of to learn many kind of life, to spend your time with friends, and to grow social ability."	3	3.5	3.5	10
546	Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There is no exactly one answer to spend time with people since each person's characteristic and way of thinking vary. So some like to get along with a small number of friends and others like to get along with a large number of friends. Each way of spending time with people has own merits, but I think the former is better. So, I prefer the former way. I'm going to explain why I think that way.
  First, I can maintain very close relationship with my friends. I usually get along with four friends who graduated from the same high school. Once I and my friends meet at some cafe or somewhere, we can talk about each person's routine for a long time and share some ideas about their future plan. By doing that, I was able to understand their hobbies and goals deeply and make a close connection with them. On the contrast, if I spend time with more people including them, it was much harder to talk individually. Therefore, I would not get close to them.
  Second, it is more time-efficient than the opposite way. It is necessary to spend time making a reservation for meeting place such as restaurant or cafe. If there are a lot of people to meet, someone must adjust everyone's schedule, which is very difficult. For example, when I was a middle school student, more than 15 classroom mates agreed to meet at the school playground by 9:00am for the travel. But some of them got up late in the morning and arrived the place we promised to meet about 9:30am. Some arrived on time but others late. So, the whole travel schedule was delayed more than 30 minutes, which made us to give up some planned activities. From this experience, I realized that it is not time-efficient to promise to meet more than 10 people at once. We can do more things without consuming time to decide what to do, where to go or what to eat. Thus, I don't have to spend much time adjusting all of my friends' schedule and worry about being late by getting along with a small number of friends.
  For these reasons, I prefer to spend time with a small number of close riends."	3	3.5	3.5	10
547	Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"I prefer to spend a time with one or two close friends, instead of spending more time with a large number of friends. Not every people will think like this because preference of us are all different. However, there are some reasons why I enjoy spending time with small amount of friends.
First of all, playing with less than three people is more effective. All of us have different needs, preferences, and feelings. For example, food is a very important topic to discuss between friends, because we always go to have lunch or dinner when we spend time together. But, if they have different preferences, it may make them really exhausted all the time they meet. In a large group, selecting a menu is a big issue. More person in the group, variety preferences exists. This makes people use more energy in choosing what to eat, instead of paying more attention to each other. On the other hand, if we meet only one or two close friends, we don't need to discuss a lot about food. We can just choose a menu in short time and spend more time in talking or doing other activities.
Second, it is more friendly in smaller group.  If there are lots of people, they usually have conversation in a smaller group. Of course, members will be rotated as the time goes, however, they can not spend entire time with each person. Otherwise, in a smaller group, all members can interact entire time, so, they can have more chance to know about each other. I'm perfectly sure that smaller group can be more familiar with friends. For instance, when I was in middle school, I had 25 girls in class, but in high school, there was 4 girls in class. Of course, I felt happy in both of them, but most of friends who are in touch with me now are from high school. In my experience, smaller group was better to make best friends. 
Because, spending time with one or two close friends is more effective and friendly, having time with smaller group is better than having time with a lot of friends."	3.5	4	3.5	11

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"When we become a university student or an adult, we meet many new people and new groups. For examples, we meet new school friends, meeting from other countries. I meet many new people, too. So I can determine clearly about this issue, I prefer meet one or two friends than large number of friends. There are three reasons why I prefer small groups. 
 First of all, I can focus on their talks more. When we meet many numbers of friends, they are talking about their own issues. For instance, if we meet eight peoples, there are three groups with three members. And they talk about absolutely different topics. So I cannot focus on one issue,   it make me confused. On the other side, If I meet only few friends, I can listen their topics better. Then I can make opinion or understand their feelings more easily.
  Second, I cannot feel friendships with all friends absolutely. There are many talks, so I always exchange many talking partners. So sometimes, we cannot our talks. Then I feel something lose,  because I feel fine when we finish talks and make conclusions. 
  Third, I like meeting of quiet places. If someone ask to me""Which one is better, concerts or movies?"", I can say I prefer movies. It is same at meetings. When we go to restaurants with many people, I can focus on something. There are too many noises, talks. So I can listen friends' sound. But when we go with less people, I can focus on more my own issues.
  There are three reasons why I prefer small groups than large numbers of groups. Those are focus problems, felling friendships, quiet places. But it is just prefer. I think we need many kinds of meetings and many different friends when we become an adult. So I hope you can make groups of right numbers which you feel better.

I prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. 

      First of all, I'm hard to make friends. I am hard to talk first with first talking person, but if I think someone is very close to me, I become very active. I want to see many factors when I am making friends. Thus, I have some close friend.

      Second, if I have a lot of friends, spending time with each friend will be reduced. Thus, making very close friends is harder than other case. If I have some close friend, we meet much time than other, so we will get closer and closer.

      Finally,  one close friend easily help me than many less closer friends. When I have troubles or problems, I can easily tell my situation to very close friends, and they will come to me as fastest as possible. However, if I have a lot of friends, but I don't have really close friends, I will not be easily able to tell my situation to them.

     For these reasons, I prefer to spend with one or two close friends than many less closer friends."	2	3	2.5	7.5

Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. "	"I would like to choose my own roommate. 
 The main reason is about handling the conflict bewteen roommates. Since the Dormitory room is the place where the roommate and I are living, the conflict between us seems to be unevitable. There might be several kinds of conflicts, including cleaning the room, living pattern, and gap of individual characteristics as well. It would be great if the roommate and I become best friends and we can also handle all the problems between us. However, if the university assigns the student into each room randomly, those troubles are expected. If we choose our own roommate, we will be able to get through the problems much more easier. 
 The other reason is happiness. We spend a lot of time in dormitory. At least 8 hours each day. Which means we spend a lot of time with roommate as well. The roommate is almost family, since we have meal together, get to sleep together, and might get into class together. Students must have right to choose someone to spend time with. In this case, someone would be his/her roommate. 
 For happier campus life especially in dormitory, I prefer choosing my roommate to being assigned by college."	2.5	3	3	8.5

Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. "	"As the semester begun, there is some issues about the roommate of dormitory rooms. If you do not choose your own roommate, you would meet a student who is assigned by university. The student may be gentle, friendly, and may become a best friend later. However, you and your roommate may also have a trouble with the room condition. Hence, I'd rather choose my won roommate when I get this situation. 

 The random roommate is random. It means that I cannot choose his characteristics.  For example, I have a friend who have a university assign student to share room with him. He got a roommate who did not clean his room for more than 3 months. He got a lot of stress and finally clean his roommate's trashes, bed, and desk. He told me that it is not easy to clean the things that he didn't messed up. From this story, I've learned that random doesn't always means good and may be bad.

 Also, you can be real friend with your own roommate. If you become a roommate with your friends, then you may live him with at least 8 hours a day. You will know his small habit which you didn't recognize before. As time pass by, you will understand what your friends want to say, even if your friends don't tell you and just pointing something. It is very meaningful to get someone who understand you and this may be the great chance to get him.

 Of course there is one who want to meet a new roommate and be friend, but for me to be friend with strange is not an easy activity to do.To talk with someone who is not close to me is also not an easy thing. Since we live together, there may be a situation that I should ask him to do something but it will give me tons of stress and that situation may be very stressful. 

 University is a place to meet a new friend but the dormitory room is a place that we take a rest and should be the best place to find peace. However, if I choose the random roommate, many issues can happen and will be not a peaceful place  to take a rest. For these reasons, I would live with my own roommate."	3.5	3	3.5	10

One is the university assign a student to share a room, and another is the students choose their roommates. Then, I prefer the way that we choose our own roommates, and explain why this method is better.
 First, it helps on students' mental health. During the dormitory life, the most threaten factor to students is mental health. Other factors like physical problems or economic problems can solve with help of university. However, it is hard to take care their mental health. So, by choosing their own roommates, it will provide the dormitory environment that students can satisfy and feel comfortable.
 Second, the university can easily control the dormitory. If we cannot choose our own roommates, their will be able to have some complains about their roommates. Then, they can have the conflicts and the accidents with them
 As a result, dormitory rooms in university should be chosen their own roommate because it is good for students' mental health and dormitory."	1.5	2	2.5	6

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. "	"I would like to choose my own roommate rather than having the university assign a roommate for me. There are mainly two reasons why I prefer choosing roommate by myself. Before starting my argument, I will set a basic condition that roommate chose by the university is likely to be someone who I don't know at all.

 First, living with someone who I know is much more convenient than living with someone who I don't know. So it is better to choose roommate by myself.  When I choose my roommate, I can live with friends or people who I know well so I can easily communicate with them about some problems happening in room in fast and easy ways. For example, if there's some problem in bathroom facilities in my room, I can freely call or talk to my roommate to notice it and solve it together. However, if I become a roommate with someone who I never met, I would be worried about talking about some problems in my room because of my shyness.  So in order to enjoy convenient and direct solving dormitory life, it will be better to live with someone who I know.

 Second, using dormitory room means sharing my individual life, sometimes important secret, with a roommate so it is better to live with someone I know. Because living in one room involves some conditions of sharing my life pattern with my roommate, I don't want to give so many information about me to someone who I don't know. Especially nowadays because of pandemic, I have to talk with someone by phone call,  sometimes eat my meal simply in my dormitory room. And I won't like to share all my daily life to stranger just because she is my roommate. In addition, it's quite negative imagination but if I become a roommate with someone who really hates me or I hate, it will be very stressful. As I think dormitory room should also work as 'home' where I can relax and feel calm while using there, I want to live with roommate who I chose, approved that I can share some of my personal life with her.

 To summarize my argument about the topic, I would prefer choosing my own roommate because living with someone who I can communicate easily and share some of my daily life is much better than living with someone who I don't know. Some might say living with a stranger is not hard at all, so it is okay for the university to randomly match roommates. However, because it differs by person by person, to choose one common method of roommate decision system, it will be better to give chances to people like me who have worries about living with random roommates."	4	4	4	12

I think choosing my own roommate is better than university assigning a student to share a room with me. There are some reasons why I think like this.
 First, if one of roommate come from other country, it will be difficult to communicate and understand each other. For example, not all of KAIST students are good at English. But, if they have foreign country roommate, it will be hard to communicate each other. Furthermore, being friendly with each other is not easy because of language.
 Second, there are many conflict with roommate. If we choose roommate that can understand each other, it will be fine. I think this reason is why many of KAIST students choose roommate who is at same club, same class, and graduated same high school. 
 Third, it is more easy for university dormitory department. In KAIST, many student use changing roommate system. It is very hard to check because university assign a student first, and students change roommate next. So if student choose roommate, it would be more convinence for university.
 I think choosing my own roommate is better because of communication, understanding each other, and convinence of university."	3	3	3	9

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. "	"I think ""Having the university assign every freshman's roommate and giving students chance to choose their own roommate from second grade""  is the best way. 

 For the first reason, it is about the merit of ""Having the university assign every freshman's roommate"". Many freshman have difficulty on making friends at first time. So it would be better to match the students randomly so that they don't concern if they can't find their roommate. And this randomly matched roommate can be good friends for each other.

 For the second reason, it is about the advantage of ""Giving students chance to choose their own roommate from second grade"". The opportunity to select their own roommate is the reasonable right for the students. And I think sophomore is the proper period that student can use that right wisely because they adapted to the university and overall dormitory life.

 This is the way that KAIST actually assigns the room for the students. And I am really satisfied with this dormitory room assignment policy. However, I also heard about the friends' story that they had some trouble with randomly assigned roommates. But thanks to the dormitory policy and dormitory readers' help, he could solve that problem well.

 So I think ""Having the university assign every freshman's roommate and giving students chance to choose their own roommate from second grade"" is the best way that offsets both way's demerits and makes merits remain."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

               Do you know that where many university students live? Some university students live in their own house, but many students live in university dormitory. So, many university students have their roommates. However, in some university, students can not choose their roommates. It's because school choose random roommates. I think it's wrong. University must make students  choosing their own roommate!
               The first reason is that if students have random roommate, they can not rest well in dormitory. Dormitory is a students' house. So, students should feel comfortable when they are in dormitory. However, if they have random roommates that they don't know, then students can not rest in their room.
               Secondly, many students have different life-circle. Student A wakes up at 7:00 and sleeps at 22:00, but student B wakes up 13:00 and sleeps 3:00. So, they have different life-circle. If A and B are roommate, they will fight because of their life-style. Furthermore, students get many stress because of their roommates. So, students must choose their roommates who have same or similar life-circle. 
               The last reason is about study-place. Now, university students usually take lectures in dormitory because of COVID-19 situation. So, they have to take lecture videos or zoom lecture. If they have random roommates, some student can not take lectures in their room because that students and his roommate have to take different lectures that need to speak. For example, My friend has random roommate, and he can not take lectures in his room because his roommate has lecture at same time. 
               In conclusion, university students must choose their own roommates because of three reasons. Students can not rest and get stress because of different life-circle and same schedule. So, I think university students can choose their own roommates, not random roommates!"	3	3	3	9

Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. "	"I prefer the first one.
 There are several reasons that I think so.
 First, meeting new friends is important in university. And dormitory gives a good chance to make new friends. For example, there are many students in KAIST who came alone from their high school(such as non-science school). And they may think that it is hard to choose their own roommate in school. So, if university assign a student to share a room with them, they can easily meet and make new friends.
 Next, I think it is chance to friendly with many other peoples. When I was a high school student, school assign 3 students to share a room with me. At first, I was nervous because I didn't know any of them. But after some time, I can get friendly with them and also, I can meet many other people(students, teachers, ...) because of them. So, I think that it is helpful to meet many other people and know about their personality.
 Last, we can get new knowledge by meeting another person. As I mentioned above, we can meet many other people in new circumstances. And by meeting and talking with them, we can know about new information, their personality, interests, and so on. This helps us not only to study academically, but also to know 'people'.
 For these reasons, I prefer that university assign a student to share a room with me."	3	3	2.5	8.5

Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. "	"At KAIST almost all students live in dormitories. And there are lot of ways to assign students to the dormitory. The university can assign a student to share a room with me, or rather let me to choose our own roommate. Assigning students in the dormitory can be controversial whatever the university chooses. But in my opinion, letting the students choose their roommates are a better choice for 2 reasons.

Firstly, There will be no awkwardness between roommates, which will enhance the quality of one's life pattern. For example, If the roommate is a somebody I'm not really close to, then I have to be careful of my behavior even at my dormitory. Which will give me a lot of stress and will not allow me to rest in peace at my room. Then someone can say, ""You solve that problem by being friends with your roommate!"". That is a good solution but there are always people who can't be friends in a short time or   doesn't wanna be friends with the roommate. So, I think letting us to choose our own roommates will be a better chose then letting university to chose my roommate.

Secondly,  roommates can be better friends than before. There are some friendships that is close but not that close enough. But by being roommates they will interact each other most of their times which will yield better friendship than before. For example, We can wake each other when we have early classes and we can go eat lunch or dinner together. Or maybe lend their things each other.  Which will definitely be closer friends than before. 

We talked about whether universities should assign a student to share a room with me, or let us to choose my own roommate. And my opinion was to let the students to choose their roommate themselves because of 2 reasons. First, there will be no awkwardness between roommates, which will enhance the quality of one's life pattern. Second, roommates can be better friends than before. So, I think letting the students to choose their roommate are a better chose."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. "	"We share all of our life with roommate when we are in university which have dormitory. There are two ways to choose roommate. One is to have the university assign a student to share a room with you, and the other is to choose your own roommate. I prefer to choose my own roommate for two reasons.
 First, we can live comfortably in dormitory from the beginning of the semester. We usually feel uncomfortable when we are in the place with stranger. The student which university choose for my roommate will probably be the person who I have never met before. So, we need to have ice-breaking time. But, when we choose roommate who I already know, we will feel relaxed every time.
 Second, there will be trouble if the roommate have different life style. Roommate is very important cause we have to share nearly all of the life style with them for a half or whole year. If we met the roommate with different life style, we have to suffer for more than half of the year. Imagine the situation which person A who sleeps early and study in the morning and person B who sleeps late and study all night became roommate. When A want to sleep, B will turn on the light to study. When B want to sleep, A will woke up and might makes some noises. Both of them will suffer from having a good sleep.
 In conclusion, I think living with a student who university chose for me is too risky. It will needs some times to be friendly and might have trouble because of different life style. So, I will choose roommate by my self to enjoy my perfect dormitory life."	3	3	3	9
561	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. "	"When students begin their campus life, school usually assign a roommate for them. Some of the students can be a good friend with their roommate, but other might spend horrible semester because of the difference of characteristics, snoring and many other reasons. So, I think there are much more advantages if we choose our own roommate. 

 First, we don't have to feel fear about meeting new kinds of person. Usually, meeting various people is important. But, If we narrow down this issue to 'roommate', new kinds of person can be an 'unnecessary' fear. For example, let's pretend I like cleaning room and sleep at 0am. I might be very exhausted if my random roommate don't like cleaning and sleep earlier than me. Unfortunately, we even cannot know the information like I mentioned IF our roommate is randomly assigned by school. But, if I can choose my own roommate, this problem can be solved. I can choose roommate who has similar life style with me. I think the most important value of college is 'free'. So, we don't have to be stressed because of our random roommate. Meeting new kinds of person is important. But, in this case it is unnecessary.

 Second, snoring or some habits of roommate can be a great interruption. When I was a high school students, our dormitory roommates were randomly assigned by teacher. As a result of it, I had to use room with friends who snore a lot and other friends who was sensitive to it. I can't sleep if my room isn't quiet. So, it was such a harsh semester for me. If school randomly assign roommates, their must be lots of victims if there is no system to handle it. The best and easiest way is to let students choose their own roommates.

 We should handle the problems generated by different characteristics and specific habits of roommates if school randomly assign our roommate. With elaborate assigning system, random assignment can be effective. But, I think letting students to use their room with their 'best fit' is better way."	3.5	3.5	3	10

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. "	"Maybe you saw that many students live in dormitory who is in university. In KAIST, there are many dormitory and we can choose room and roommate. So, I've thought about using dormitory room with random roommate or with roommate I choose. Each have good and bad point, but I think choose my own roommate is better.
First, we don't need to worry about roommate. When I was in highschool there is dormitory and its roommate was random. There were many type of roommates such as student who sleep late at night, noisy student, dirty student, and so on. It makes stress to worry my new roommate. However, if I choose my roommate, I can select roommate as I want. Of course, it is hard to choose when I assign, but it is better than ramdom roommate. Because of worrying of roommate, I think choosing my own roommate is better.
Second, it don't need to get awkwardness. When I was in highschool, it was hard to move room because of awkwardness with new roommate. Of course, as time goes, I and my roommate are relieved of awkwardness but depending on the roommate, it can be difficult. So, it is better to use room with person I choose.
Third, it is easy to play with another friends in my room. If there is random roommate in the dormitory, it is difficult to call other friends in my room, when my roommate get shy. As I'm in university and in dormitory, it is frequent to call friend in my room and play with. I think it is easy to do with roommate who I choose. So I think choosing roommate on my own is better.
In conclusion, I think it is better to choose my own roommate because we don't need to worry about roommate, don't need to get awkwardness, and easy to play with another friends in my room."	3	3.5	3	9.5

Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. "	"Dormitory is one of the most important parts in campus life. It is the place where students spend most times and live. So roommate who live together is important. We have to live in same room for everyday so roommate effects your life strongly. If I have to live with roommate together, I prefer choosing roommate in my own. 
  First, if university assign roommate randomly, we need some times  to be closer and friendly. We meet first time at dormitory as a roommate so we don't know about each other. In worse, if random roommate is foreigner it will be much harder to be close and communicate because of different language. And this leads to uncomfortable life.
 Next, it's comfortable to live. If roommate and I are not close, we cannot act as I do in my home. However, if I choose my roommate, I can choose who have similar life style. But in random, we have to make rules to not bother each other. Also, if we have different activity time, it's hard to eat lunch or turn on the light. Because of covid-19, most of university prefer online classes. So different life style can also effect studying.  This little things stacks and can become stress to you.
 Finally, I can get some information more easily. If I choose my roommate in same department, we can share some tips about classes or school life. We can share textbook pdf files, alarm class times and some notices. It can improve their  mistakes each other. 
 To conclude, I would rather choose my roommate because I don't have to spend time to be close, more comfortable life and can get information. Dormitory has great effectness in university life. So if 2 people must live in 1 room, university have to give chance to choose their own roommates."	2.5	3.5	2.5	8.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. "	"Most universities have a dormitory and many students live in it.  Some students want roommates, but some students don't want roommates. I think using a room alone is better than using a room with roommates because of two reasons. 
  First, we don't have to think about a roommate's life pattern. Every people have a different life pattern. For example, people's wake-up time is very various. So, both roommates have to be careful when someone sleeping in the room. There are many other examples. It would be very uncomfortable. 
  Secondly, we can use a room more freely. When we don't have a roommate, we can use the whole room. We can change our room more suitable for us. We can place objects where we feel better. We can eat what we want in the room.  We don't need a roommate's permissions to do something. 
  I think living alone in the dormitory room is better because of differences in life patterns and freedom. The last semester, I shared a room with my friends. But now, I use a dormitory room alone and I'm satisfying more. "	2.5	3	3	8.5

Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. "	"Almost rooms of university's dormitory are not individual room.And individual room is more expensive. So almost student choose to live with their roommates. They can choose their roommate, or school choose their roommate randomly. In my case, I don't want to live with random roommate, so I contact with other students to choose my roommate. There are three reasons why I think choosing roommate myself is better than random roommate. 
First, I can choose roommate who has similar sleeping cycle. For example, I go to the bed at 12 a.m. and wake up at 7 a.m. It's not common case in KAIST. I go the bed earlier than other students and I also wake up earlier than most students. It's hard to live together in a same room, if you and your roommate's sleeping cycle is so different. Imagine that you really want to go to bed, however your roommate doing her work, you can't turn off the light to go to bed of course, and you can't sleep well with roommate who doing his/her work. Since I want to choose roommate who has similar sleeping cycle, so I want to choose my own roommate .
Second, I don't have any information of random roommate. Maybe she is bad at cleaning her room, or she don't clear herself, or she always talk to the phone loudly, etc. In my high school, a girl  always talk to her boyfriend until the late night. Her roommate, my best friend,  couldn't sleep well because of her voice and light of her phone.  I think I can't stand out with that types of roommates. But if I choose my roommates, I can search and ask about my roommate whether she is nice, and clean. Choosing by university has high probability of meeting weird roommates.
Lastly, I can share room with my friends. I guess most people prefer to share their room with their friends than strangers. If you share dormitory room with your friends, you can feel like having school trip everyday, you can talk each other all night, and you can eat delicious food with your friends in your room! I think it must be nice experience to everyone. And fact, many students choose their friends to roommate until now. 
These three reasons show why I think choosing roommate myself is better than choosing random roommate by university. I can choose roommate who has similar sleeping cycle for my comfortable sleep, I can avoid someone who doesn't accept to living together and I can share dormitory room with my friends. If you worry about your new roommate, I recommend you to find your roommate yourself. It must be better than choosing by university."	3.5	4	3.5	11

Some people said that chosen roommate is better than assigned roommate but, others argued in opposite. In this article, I mention that chosen roommate is better than randomly assigned roommate for the following reasons.
 First, if we choose our roommate in our own, we can lessen arguments with each other. When we choose our roommates, we can consider that his or her habits such as sleeping patterns and time span when activated are similar with me. When roommates are assigned randomly by the university and there characteristics are totally different with me, then arguments between roommates would be occur more easily.
 Second, we can have a time in dormitory more comfortably when we choose our roommate. If we choose our roommate, we usually choose roommate as a friend who is most friendly with us. Time using dormitory room with best friend becomes more comfortable than with friends whom we met new.
  Of course, if we respect each other when we use dormitory with roommates, then each person would have a good time using dormitory room for either case; choosing our roommates or assigning our roommates. But, letting us to choose our roommates can make us live more happily for the reasons following; it lessens arguments with each other and make us use dormitory more comfortably. So kaist should consider this point to us."	3	3	3	9
567	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. "	"If there is no COVID 19 situation, almost all of the students may be in dormitory rooms in campus. When we have to go there, the most important thing that student concerns about is his or her roommate. Some of the students say that we need to choose our own roommate. However, in my opinion, It is better that the university assign a student to share a room.
           First, we can make a new friend. In many universities, especially in KAIST, around a thousand students newly come to the campus from different high schools. Some of them might do not have high school friends and do not know anyone before the class begins. In this situation, if the university makes them choose their roommate, they will become very hard to choose someone. If the university assign new person to them, however, they might be awkward at the first few days, but they do not need to worry about it. Furthermore, it is a good chance to make a new friend. 
           On top of that, we can avoid some problems which are caused by choosing roommate. In my experience, it is rare that someone has only one friend. Generally, the students play together with group, which is more than three people. For example, imagine that 3 people come to the same university and they are friend each other. When they have to choose their roommate, It is natural that they want to choose their group members. However, the dormitory rooms must be shared only by two. They get some problem here, but ultimately, this could not be happend if the university has assigned new student to each of them.
           To summarize, I think choosing our own dormitory roommate is a bad choice because we can miss a great chance to make new freinds and there might be a problem if we do so. I said about the problem when the number of friend group is odd, but still there can be many other problems. Since there are many advantages and disadvantages for each opinion, so we need to think about this topic in various aspects."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
568	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. "	"   I think that choosing my own roommate is better choice. There are two reasons why I prefer to choose  my own roommate in this case, one is from individual aspect and the other is from aspect of system efficiency.
  First, both of me and my roommate will be in better condition while studying, playing, and keeping our performance growing. If I choose my roommate, I will consider how friendly he is and how his living routine is. And this will go same for other students. Good relationship with roommate can give students energy to overcome difficulties (in studying, making an important decision, etc.) and evolve themselves being a confident and powerful ones. Having similar routine with roommate is important to executing schedules of both of us. If not, one's behavior(such as studying with light on) can bother the other.
  Second, letting the university assign my roommate lacks of efficiency and doesn't make sense. the dormitory team can surely attain dormitory users' requirement and assign students considering the requirements obtained. So choosing roommate would come first before the university assign students' roommate. If students' requirement or choice about roommate collide, then they should make a agreement each other after some contacts. Otherwise, the university should consider random assign as final tool.
  According to these two reasons, I strongly argue that choosing my own roommate is much better choice than the former. It will improve performances of me and my roommate by keeping good relationship, synchronizing day routine, with the system making its best effort and result."	3	3.5	3.5	10
569	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"In life, when we decide on a major of a job, we agonize over to choose a high-paying job with long hours that would give the person little time with family and friends or to choose a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give the person more time with family and friends. If this decision making situation happens to me, I will choose a high-paying job with long hours.
The first reason is that for me, the reason for making money is to use the money that we earned. I think the reason why we earn money if that with money we can eat delicious food, buy good clothes, and live a better life with family and friends. So not being able to use money with family and friends around you to make money is a ridiculous. 
The second reason is that memory and happiness with family and friends are more important than money. Almost everyone has a beautiful childhood memory. For example there are memories of going to an amusement park with their parents when they were a child, or eating tteokbokki sold in front of elementary school with their friends. Like these memories, every small memories are kept as a beautiful memories. On the other side, most of people could not remember the finance of their home at that moment. This implies, people remember the situation about spending money more than the finance of their home or themselves. Thus I would prefer to spend time for making memories and happiness than making money.
The last reason is that too much money can make you even unfortunate. You've heard at least once that the winner of the lottery went bankrupt because the person couldn't manage one's money property. This shows that too much property which is out of one's management can be worse.
Some people says the most important thing in life is having a great deal of property and they will argue that people should prefer a high-paying job with long hours. Even though it will give the person little time with family and friends. However, as my reason for making money is to use the money for my life, the memories and happiness are more valuable to me than money and I think too much is worse, I prefer a lower-paying job with shorter hours than a high-paying job with long hours"	4	4	4	12
570	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"Everyone loves to hang out with their friends and their family. But money is essential when it comes to spending times with their friends and their family. So many people work to get paid. There are generally two types of jobs: high-paying job with long hours and low-paying job with shorter hours. Although jobs with shorter hours have more opportunities to have more time with their acquaintance, I think high-paying occupation with longer hours is better choice by several reasons.

First, literally workers can earn more money than low-paying jobs. People can be fired or they get old and quit the job. Then, it will be hard to get another job, so until they acquire new job or earn money from the government, they have to spend money that they earned in past. The main difference between high-paying job and low-paying job is workers will have different future. Also, people who work hard can save money for their family or friends, and spend great times with them in the future. Of course, they cannot spend much time with their family right now, but they can spend a great quality of times after they earn a considerable amount of money. Money that workers can make than low-paying job is one of the reason that I choose.

Next, lower-paying job with shorter hours will have a bad quality of time spending with friends. For example, let's think about nowadays college students. They get some money from their parents or earn it from part-time job. Usually part-time jobs and pocket money are low-paying jobs. Most of college students in Korea spend time with their friends playing games and drinking. But not enough of money makes students hang out less or have limited experience. So workers that paid low cannot have a quality of time.

For the last, people who work hard can spend free time wisely than others. For example, assume there is a worker A who works part-time job on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and assume worker B who works weekdays 9am to 6pm. Of course, in short term, worker A will have more free time than worker B and will have more fun. But in long term, worker B has lower amount of free time than worker A, so B will spend holidays or vacation wisely than A. A has four free days in one week, so it doesn't really matter if A wastes one day, but B has two free days in one week, so he will spend the time effectively than worker A. And spending free time wisely will make the worker more fun.

Their are several reasons why I think jobs that pays a lot is better such as earning some money, having a quality of free time, and being a wise person. Some might say money is not everything in life and choose lower-paying job with shorter hours but living in this society need some money and that is the reason people work hard."	4	4	3.5	11.5
571	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"There are various jobs in this world. Some jobs can earn lot of money, but giving little time for rest. In other case, some jobs don't give a lot of money, but it can provide lot of time to rest. I will prefer the first job, giving a lot of money and little time for rest for three reasons. 
 First of all, we can use time for efficiently. If we earn a lot of money, we can enjoy anything except for hobby that takes a lot of time. We can buy a expensive drone for hobby, or buying luxury cars. But if we have low-paying job, we can't use time with satisfaction. Even though we have a lot of time, there are cost-limit due to the low-incoming. We can't enjoy hobby as we want. For example, if hobby is a golf, we can prepare the experts' equipment which cost a lot, and going on a real field if we earn a lot of money. But when we don't have a lot of money, we can't buy sufficient equipment to enjoy the golf, and cannot go on a field. 
 Secondly, family can have better environment. As we earn a lot of money, we can give more money to family for living. Then family can live in a better places, study in better conditions. Even though we can't meet family often, we can be satisfied by watching family living in a good environment. But in case of low-payment job, we can't offer any good conditions for our family. And we have a lot of time to stay with family, it will be more painful watching family living in unstable environment.
 At last, we can take care of health better. Many people might think that it is harmful for health if we don't have enough time to rest. But in reality, it is opposite. If we have a lot of money, we can take care of our body by eating many vitamins and healthy foods. Also, we can get personal training in gym. But in case of having lot of time and small income, people can't take care of themselves. The time for sleeping will be the only one that is better. But depending on people, some people prefer to sleep in better condition such as better bed, more quite places than sleeping more in uncomfortable places. So I can say that there are nothing better for health if we have more time to rest with less payment
 In conclusion, I prefer to get a high-paying job than low-paying job even it have less time to spend with family and friends. It is due to three reasons, we can use rest-time more efficiently, family can live in better environment and for our health."	4	4	4	12
572	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"  The question means to choose between using time to earn money or being with family. I would spend more time with family and friends rather than get more money with shorter time to spend with them. I propose that earning money is easier than get a belief to my people. There are some reasons why earn lower money is better.
  First, we can not buy 'time' by anything, even by the money. We can not know what will happen even in next second, which means we should spend time wisely at every moment. Earning money is very meaningful time as well as taking brake with people, however, I think taking a rest with my people would be better. Talking and sharing each others' story make the relationship harder.
   Moreover, just earning money can not express your mind to people. If you give only money to friends or families and do not spend time with them, the relationship would be hard to continue. What they want is 'time' to spend with, not just money. As time goes on, they will give up to spend time with you, which would make you alone. The money can not make the relationship.
  In addition, working long hours without taking enough rest would make you tired. It will make you just earn money without using it because you have no time. I think this is meanless, since the reason why you earn the money is to spend. Even though the money is lower, we can get time to use by doing a less work. Also, working too much can make your mental weaker. Since you are tired with a hard job, some little thing can make you feel upset or sad. It can lead to weaker relationship with your people, and the cycle goes on and on.
  This problem is depend on the thought about relationship and the money. People who think the money is better than the relationship with people will choose high-paying job which takes long time. On the other hand, people who think relationship more important like me will get lower-paying job, and take time with their people."	4	4	3.5	11.5
573	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"The reason people get educated and master specific subjects are mostly to do a job that gives them money. Then, what will be the fuel that makes people help to endure the stress while working? Money can buy stuff that can make yourself or special ones satisfied and happy such as clothes, delicious food, a ticket to a park. Also, there is a famous phrase, ""Money can't buy happiness"", which means that there shouldn't be a choice that puts money more valuable than happiness. Like this, the purpose of doing a job and getting paid has to be to spend quality time with family and friends even though they get shorter pays.
 Choosing a high-paying job with long hours doesn't have a clear purpose. Because of this, at some moment it might end up just chasing money without taking care of personal relationships. Or, let's say there was a clear goal. such as ""Despite the loss of quality time with my lovers I will earn more money and make it possible to spend a memorable time later!"" It seems like it's a nice plan but the family and friends might think differently. Instead of  'fancy' places and parties they might be looking forward to more family dinners or spending mundane life routines. Don't forget, it isn't the money that buys happiness it is the memories and time.
In addition, chasing for more money will give the worker more stress. The source that makes them endure working is the thought that 'by getting paid after this I will be able to present me and my friends a better time.' However, once you start to chase money without looking back, quality time that is spent with precious people will decrease. This might make the bond and relationships worse than it was and if it those the worker loses the source that helped him overcome mental and physical stress from work. Which makes the worker nothing more than a machine working without any purpose and will give more stress to the worker, a negative loop.
For these reasons choosing a lower-paying job that gives you more time with family and friends is a better decision. Chasing money without a clear purpose might mess up the relationships and even though there is a purpose the family and friends won't be happy with just money. Also, the relations will disappear which was the fuel that made people work and come back as bigger stress. Don't forget it's time that makes people"	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
574	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"Nowadays, people study very hard in university and spend lots of efforts to get jobs after graduating university. High-paying job is considered as a standard of success in modern society, and some people even give up their personal lives to work more and earn more money. However, I prefer a lower-paying job with shorter hours rather than a high-paying job with long hours.

 For a first reason, job is nothing but a way to earn money which is needed to enjoy the life. Therefore, I think you don't have to work more if you can earn enough money to enjoy your life. For example, there are two men who like to drive cars as a hobby. One man works for a high-paying job with long hours, and the other man works for a lower-paying job with shorter hours. The man working for a high-paying job may buy an expensive car, but he won't have time to drive the car. On the other hand, the man working for a lower-paying job may buy a cheaper car, but he will have time to drive the car and enjoy his hobby even with the cheaper car. So, I think spending minimum time for working and spending extra time  for enjoying life is a wise decision.

 Second, even though you can't earn enough money to live a rich life, spending time with other people like family or friends is an important part of your life. Of course money can provide you a better environment and happier life, interacting and spending time with other people also makes your life happier. Furthermore, time with family and friends can't be bought with money and can't be spent whenever you want. High-paying jobs with long hours can give you happiness by making you rich, but it will also give you stresses by taking your time that you should spend with other people. The happiness arising from spending time with close people is much greater than the happiness you can get from the money you earn on that time.

 Every people should work to earn money because the money is necessary to live a life. However, you should not spend all of your life at earning money because you also need a time to enjoy your life and a happiness that can't be achieved with the money. Therefore, I prefer a lower-paying job with shorter hours than a high-paying job with long hours."	4	4	4	12
575	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"We spend most of our time with family, and all of us enjoy playing with our friends. Friends, and family are very important in your lifes. So, I believe it is better to have a low-paying job with shorter hours than a high-paying job with long hours.

First, the reason we should have jobs shorter working hour is the human relationships. There is a study conducted in US, showing the importance of relationships with other people such as family, friend, and neighbors. The result suggested that people with a better human relationships were enjoying their life more, healther and even lived longer than others. If we have a job with shorter working time, we can spend more time with our family, stay close to friends, and even make new friends, so that we can have happier and healthier life.

Second, lets compare high paying job with long hours and lower paying job with shorter hours. It is true that if you have a high paying job, you can have a better house, car, furnitures, and many other things. The problem is that you have to work long hours, so that you cannnot have enough time to enjoy the things you earned. Also, you might have enough money to go on a trip with your family, but you cannot get enought holiday to travel with them. What is the purpose of earning money if you cannot have enough time enjoying with the money you earned?

Third, a shorter working hour will help us relax from stress. We mostly get stess from our works. With a long hour job, we will get more stress because we have to stay in workplace more often and longer. But with a shorter working time, we will get less stress from our jobs. Also, as we can have more time at home, we can have more time playing games with friends, go on travel with family, and do other things we enjoy doing. So, we can relax and get less stress, and it will help us a lot being healthy.

To sum up, a lower paying job with shorter hours, will make us have better human relationships, get healthier and give us time to enjoy life. We only have one change in our life, so we have to enjoy the time with people we like, doing what we like."	4	4	4	12
576	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"  There are issues that people argue about high-paying job with long hours versus lower-paying job with shorter hours. Currently many people say that they want to work less to rest and hang over with friends and family more to have their work-life valance. However, I think high-paying job with long hours would be more relevant for me. 
 First, high-paying job with long hours would give me a high-quality time with my family and friends. I prefer quality to mass of the time. It is true that have more times with family and friends is precious. But, the quality of times would be decreased than my situation because of the low budget. I would choose T-bone steak once rather than Mcdonald hamburger ten times. It is true that long work hours will give me stress but the great times with my friends and family will help me get rid of my fatigue. Therefore, the working satisfaction will be increased and the enthusiasm will be increased too.For example, I used to work at English academy 6days a week in January. I rest on Sunday. It was true that it was tough until Sunday. However, I had a wonderful holiday with my girlfriends at fancy restaurant and luxury shopping mall. This time gave me a power to move 6days and I loved to work. 
 Second, high-paying jobs give me a motivation to work harder for my company. As I said at second paragraph, it gives me a high budget to enjoy a gorgeous holiday. This is the great factor that high-paying jobs motivation. Also, high-paying jobs give me a relevant reason to work more for the company's development as making me responsible to deserve to earn more money. If the company pay me less, I feel the company do not recognize me right. Therefore the satisfaction of the company would be decreased. In contrast, if the company pay me more, I feel the company understand my value. So the satisfaction and enthusiasm for work would be increased. For instance, this is the one of the main reasons that the company's work force protest for their low fees.
 To sum up, I would choose a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends because of the quality of time that I spend with my people and the motivation to work for the company. These are the reasons why I prefer high-paying job with less time with my people. Thank you for reading my writing.

577	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"Among the issues that many people are paying attention to in modern society, whether it is better to work high-payed and spend more little time with family and friends than work lower-payed with more time with family and friends remains contentious. Although there are reasons to get a high-paying job with long hours that gives little time with family and friends, I believe that it is better to get a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give me more time with family and friends.

First, some people might insist that high-payed will enhance the quality of the time spending with family and friends, but I argue that the lack of conversation between them will make the moment feel worse. Since they had a short time to spend together because of the job condition, they do not have any recent information about each other, so continuing the conversation full of joy will be harder than the others. 

In addition to the fact that fewer contacts make the moment worse even though there are many wealthy conditions around, it may be true that earning a lot of money is an essential key for a happy life in the future. Despite the fact that money makes the future life happier, we have to think about what makes us happy right now. People's self recognization is consisted and constructed based on their surroundings, which are their family and friends. According to this fact, spending much time regardless of what they do together, will make us feel loved and gives us time to recognize who we are. Furthermore, I argue that high self-recognization is the most important key to be happy, so choosing a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give more time with family and friends is better. 

Nonetheless, some people still cling to the mistaken notion that spending a short time with their family and friends makes them feel energized, however, having shorter hours after a long time of work will make the worker more stressed. For instance, many would feel tired after a long period of work and they would not want to visit and hang out with someone right away. In addition, the given little time with family and friends will steel the time for the worker to have extra time for themselves to do their hobbies such as sports or playing instruments. Ultimately, this will lead the worker to stressed full condition at the workplace.

However, while some people consist that choosing a high-paying job with long hours that would give them little time with family and friends is more beneficial, I believe that it is much worse. Even though they get paid a lot more, working for long hours will make the connection between their family and friends weaker and lose themselves full of stress. Consequently, I insist that working at a place where I get lower-payed with more time with family and friends is a better choice."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
578	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"  As students turn into adults, they become independent from their parents, and need to get jobs . While they are getting jobs, many people face the dillema between getting a high-paying job with long hours or getting a lower-paying job with shorter hours. If I face that kind of situation, I will choose a lower-paying job that would give me more time with family and friends. 

  First of all, working long periods of time is bad for our health. Long hours of work makes people more tired than shorter hour of work because they spend more time concentrating on something . Also, they have shorter time to rest and this can lead to constant fatigue, which will distract them from work, plus destroying their lifestyle. Many people try to overcome this by drinking caffeine, such as coffee or energy drink. However, this can lead to caffeine addiction, and high dosage of caffeine can lead to serious problems like heart disease. As the old saying 'Health is better than money', it is not a good idea to sacrifice health in order to get large income. 

  Secondly, working long periods of time makes people stressful. In work, people get all kinds of stress, including conflict with associates, fatigue from work, and responsibility for accomplishing a project successfully. These kinds of stress intensifies if the work hour gets longer, which leads to a serious social problem; bullying in work. Employees actually commit suicide because of bullying and work stress, escpecially in IT companies in Korea such as NAVER or NEXON, which is notorious for its long work hour. 
  
  Lastly, working short hours give us more free time, which enables us to do something what we really want. Each people have their 'bucket list', which is the list that includes thing they really want to do before they die. Some of them can be acheived easily, but some of them, like extreme sports like skydiving, or traveling with friends needs to be done while we are still young and free. If we had high-paying job with long hours, we will certainly get high amount of money, but we will be old and tired at that period. We will never get good memories, since we only did work, work, and work. We might even be alone without wife or girlfriend. Also, our friends will form a family and cannot go anywhere without them. How can we do things like traveling around and do extreme sports with friends while we are at this kind of situation? 
  
  Money is important, but there are more important things in our life such as health, good memories, and friends. Long hours of working may give us lots of money, but requires us to sacrifice other aspects of life. For these reasons, I think it is more better to have lower-paying job with shorter hours."	4	4	4	12
579	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"    People always find it difficult to choose between work-and-life balance, whether it should be work, which affects their economical state, or life, meaning their own hobby, personal relationships, and etc. If people choose to take more time on work, they can earn more money. On the other hand, investigating in life increases the satisfaction of daily life. This is why I think it's better to have more time with family and friends even though I would earn less money than high-paying jobs.
    First, the average quantity of stress differs with the amount of time spent on working. Because work is where not only people should concentrate on each of their tasks, but prepare for presentations or critical meetings. Many researches show that the longer a person works, the less he/she would feel his/her life as a happy life. Stress is followed by decrease in health as well, because it is also known as a main cause of many dangerous diseases like cancer. Less working hours mean better life quality.
    On the contrary, job with shorter hours able us to investigate on relationships. However, a part of people argue that the amount of money they earn also acts a factor for happiness. Which is true, but quality of life also depends on communications with others as well. One's perspective about success might be a billionaire, but without nobody beside him/her, that success would be meaningless, unable to share feelings such as happiness, upset, frustration and much more. Having deeper connections with family and friends can allow them to help each other when they are in a challenging situation.
    In conclusion, I would choose lower-paying hobs with shorter hours that would give me more time with family and friends because of two main reasons; less stress and healthy relationships. By giving up some salary, people can have better health and maintain close relationships, which is a important factor of satisfying life. Finding the right balance of work-and-life is critical for having a happy daily life."	4	4	4	12
580	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"I will work in lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give me more time with family and friends. I have several 
reasons why relationships and happiness are more meaningful than money to me.
First, for me, happiness is more important value than money. I think money will be less priceless than happiness when I have earned it only for living and some remainders for hobbies. My father is a doctor and he wanted to live in the country because he thought earning money conveniently is better than aspiring for money. So when he thought it will be okay to live in the country, our family moved to the country and my parents are enjoying their lives. They enjoy their hobbies and it makes them work happier. While looking at my parents become happier after we moved to the country, the most important thing for my life become happiness, not money. 
Second, my way to relieve my stress is staying time with people who like me such as friends and familiy. After talking and playing with my people, my stress and annoying things have vanished. So,  I will work in my dream job nevertheless I could earn less money, and have valuable time with my people. Some might say money will essentially need to contain those relationships and persist in those dream life. However, I think my ability is sufficient for earning that minimal money. 
Third, because the moment cannot come back, It is important to care for my people whenever I can. There are people who only admiring money and spends little time with their family and friends. Those people think it will be no problem to meet their friends and family later when they think they have adequate money and those lives will be happy later. But the moment cannot come back. It is impossible to rewind time.  So it is crucial to care for your people not only admiring the money. 
To sum up, for me, happiness is more important value than money. So I will work in the job which I wanted to work in nevertheless it is lower paid. While working conveniently, I will spend lots of time with my friends, family for my happiness."	4	3.5	3.5	11
581	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"Since the wage has increased than the past, many people think that spending time with family and friends became more important than the money. On the other hand, some may think money is more important, since there are numerous things to enjoy in short time. Between low-paying job with short hours and high-paying job with long work hours, I prefer the latter one.
 First, without enough money, people cannot enjoy the time after the work. Someone might refer the word work-life-balance, which means work hours and life without work should be balanced.  However, I believe that even the time to spend with family is given by shorter-work hours, low-paid worker will not have enough money to enjoy the time.
 Moreover, I prefer to have my own time, rather than having time with my family or friends. In my case, I like to play computer games. It would be better for me to work long time and earn more money, so that I could buy expensive computer to play games that require high-performance.
 Finally, there are a number of areas to spend money. For example, houses has become so expensive. To have an own house, saving money is necessary. Also, people need to eat some foods and buy cars. Even if I have to work long time, I prefer to have better house, eat more delicious foods, and buy luxury cars rather than spend time with family and friends.
 To sum up, I'd like to enjoy time after work with more money and better quality, even if I have to work more. Also, due to my preference to play by my self, I think high-paying job with long hours is better than low-paying job with short hours."	4	4	4	12
582	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"    In contemporary world, it is debatable whether it is better to choose a high-paying job with long hours that would give people little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give people more time with family and friends. Although some people argue that we should choose high-paying job, I believe that the lower-paying job with longer time to hang out is better than high-paying job with shorter time to hang out.
    First of all, a lower-paying job with long free-time is more beneficial than high-paying job with shorter free-time because it broadens our perspective. To be specific, longer free-time help people meet diverse people, which allows people to better understand other perspectives. As our society is becoming more globalized, the world requires people with wide views. However, if people should spend most of their time on work, they cannot hang out with diverse people. This leads to highly limited perspectives. Thus, in modern society, it is better to choose a job with more free-time even with lower pay so that they can widen their views.
    In addition, It is better to choose lower-paying job providing people with longer time to rest than high-paying job providing shorter time to rest because it relieves people's stress. In other words, spending more time with family and friends make people more laugh and enjoy their time, which helps people better manage their stress and maintain mental health.  According to current studies, it was proved that more time to rest can reduce the probability of mental disease, while less time to less can lead to serious mental disease. Thus, it is better to choose lower-paying job with more time because people can maintain their healthy life.
    Nonetheless, some people cling to mistaken notion that high-paying job would help people better maintain their mental health in the long-term, because people can earn a lot of money in the future. Of course, it is important to invest for the future. However, if people have no time to enjoy the present, it can lead people to burn-out. Therefore, people cannot manage their mental health even in the long-term with less time to enjoy the present.
    To sum up, a lower-paying job with long time to enjoy the present would produce positive effects, such as widening people's perspectives and relieving people's stress. In conclusion, I firmly believe that a lower-paying job with longer time to relieve is more advantageous than a high-paying job with shorter time to relieve. Never should we forget that this issue may have huge impact on our future life."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
583	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"I would choose a lower-paying job with shorter hours rather than a high-paying job with long hours. The main difference between these two jobs are money and time. Considering these two factors, I will tell you two main reasons for my choice in the following paragraph.
 First, the spare time given to lower-paying job workers can be used in various ways. The most compelling point of high-paying job is 'money'. However, the gap between payment can be solved if lower-paying job workers find another job in their spare time. Since Covid 19, many people do diverse things in their house like doing investment,  buying cryptocurrency or creating an online shop. Lower-paying workers can use this environment to earn money. For example, they can use their spare time to study about economics and do investments. Plus, as said in the question, this time can be used for individual's leisure time, enjoying one's hobby and having time with friends or family . They will be able to plan and use their own time freely. 
 Second, lower-paying job will increase happiness. Working for many hours like high-paying job employees will give physical and mental stress, but solving this problem will be hard due to lack of time. On the other hand, working for short hours will give time to rest, which results in more effective and refreshing work. In many studies, the importance of 'rest' in the raise of efficiency of working is always emphasized. Increased efficiency will give accomplishment and confidence, resulting in happiness.
 In conclusion, I would be a happy and fulfilling lower-paying job worker than being an unhappy high-paying job worker because of these two reasons. The choice will depend on the individuals preference between relax and money."	4	4	4	12
584	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"  Korea society has been more competitive since 1980. Today, more than half of people in Korea work more than 50 hours a week. Those people who work long say that they receive more income than other people because they work longer. However, in my point of view, lower-playing job is preferred. Although people with high-playing jobs earn money more, I think lower-playing jobs are better because of following points: happiness and efficiency.
 People with lower-playing jobs are usually happier than other people. According to the research performed by Seoul National University, 70% of people who work less than 50 hours a week answered that they are satisfied with their jobs. On the other hand, only 40% of people who work more than 50 hours a week answered that they are satisfied. The result of the research proves that long working hours cause unhappiness.
 Not only happiness, but also efficiency is an advantage of lower-playing jobs. An example that clearly shows why lower-playing jobs are efficient is the case of kakao. Kakao is a company that sells popular programs like kakaotalk. With useful programs, kakao earned huge money. How can kakao be a huge company? The answer is in working hours. At first, programmers in kakao worked more than 50 hours a week. However, they could not produce useful programs because of long working hours that disturbs their creativity. After CEO of kakao realized that, programmers in kakao worked less than 30 hours a week. As a result, programmers produced more creative program and kakao had become a huge company.
 Some people who have negative opinions in lowe-playing jobs can ask that people cannot receive huge income with lower playing jobs. However, almost everyone agrees, the goal of life is happiness. People can be happy without huge money if they have long free time.
 Lower-playing jobs are preferred to me because of happiness and efficiency. My uncle worked 60 hours a week last year but he said he wanted to have more free time and he was not happy. If he had had lower-playing jobs, he would have been h"	4	4	4	12
585	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"Among the issues in which people's thoughts differ extremely, whether it is better to have a job with high pay and little time for joying than to have a job with lower pay and long time for happiness is still controversial. Although many people may choose the first case, I think that living with job that provides many hours for happiness is much better. 
 the reason why I hold my opinion is first, money is not a direct goal for living. Even though we can do many things by using money, it is just a tool that can be changed easily. Maybe, some argue that ""If we have money, we can buy things that can be the source of happiness."". Of course, you can feel a slight moment of satisfactory when buying a new car, phone and clothes. However, you cannot buy or rewind the time by money. Spending your life with your loved ones like parents, wife, husband, sons, daughters and friends will make you much happier than spending money for a slight happiness.
 In addition to the impossibility of buying happy time, also the hardship of maintaining balance between work and life supports my opinion. One of the most famous phrase in working-class people is ""work and life balance"" which stresses the importance of time for healing than time of working. As the purpose of corporation is to gain much more profit than the past, they demand their workers to work harder. The phenomenon becomes expanded and as a result, the quality of life of workers is decreasing. So, to accomplish the first purpose of life: to be happy, we sought to a job that assures enough time for developing oneself and having a good time with your family and friends.
 To sum up, to be a winner of life that has limited span, we need to find a job that provides enough time for joying your life! Until now, still a lot of people stick to the wrong belief that they will be happy if they have more money. What you have to know is that happiness is not proportional to the extent of wealth. Why don't we be the winner of life by selecting a job that provides joyful time  despite the lower payment? Your life will become much satisfying if you turn around and walk toward a balanced, healthy life."	4	4	4	12
586	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"Nowadays, there are various kinds of jobs all over the world, and they are all different. So, people always tries to find a job which is more suitable for themselves. Although some people think high-paying job is the best, I believe low-paying job with shorter hours is better.
 First, we can have more time with our family. Family is really important for us. Our family always encourages us, and gives love to us. Also, lots of people regret that they didn't have time for their families. For example, I lived at the dormitory in high school. When I was always in my house, I didn't realized that my family is so important for me. But in the dormitory, I realized about the importance of my family, and regretted that I had not spend more time with them.
 Besides of the importance of family, working shorter hours are better for the health. Not all people enjoys their life in the office. They get stress from the large tasks, and relationships with coo-workers. When a job has long working hours, people cannot sleep enough and this can result in health problems. For instance, my dad once went to a company with a large amount of work. He even worked at home, usually until late at night. Due to the stress, my dad's health became so bad that he decided to move to another company. Now he is enjoying the work and his health became much better.
 Nevertheless, some people insists that having more money can make people happy. However, money cannot make people happy. There are many stories about people who had win the Rotto. When people win a Rotto, they cut their relationships with people since they want the money for themselves. But, in the end, all the people became lonely and unhappy, because of  the lack of relationships. 
 To sum up, I claim that lower-paying jobs with shorter hours are better. We can spend more time with our family, be healthy. Also, money is not the only way for being happy. I think people should not focus only on money and think about their health and the relationships with others."	4.5	4.5	4	13
587	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"Both family and friends are important for our life. In our experience, young adults are likely to spend more time with their friends than their families, but it does not mean that family is not important. My opinion is that family is the most important influence on young adults.

The first reason is that friends change, but family does not change. Although there are people who their families are changed, it is a minority case. In general, the members of family are constant. Since family does not change, members of family influents a person  for a long time, from the birth to the death. In contrast, friendship is temporary. Friendship might be changed by social distance, hobbies, or ideologies. Therefore, the influence from friends are actually temporary.

Meanwhile, there are young adults who have a few friends. Since most people are busy in modern society, It is hard to make friends. Actually, making friends is harder than the readers might think. Unlike middle or high schools, it is hard to see for adults to gather in a same place. Moreover, a significant number of adults live in different places than they are grown up, so they might have few friends. By these reasons, it is not hard to see young adults without many friends. For these adults, their family has a larger influence.

Moreover, we have more physical contact with family than friends. It is not hard to gather friends online. We have various tools for online meeting or chat, such as Kakatotalk and Zoom. Moreover, we can make friends online by meeting people with same interests via internet and applications. In contrast, contact with family members are likely to be physical, not online. We know by experience that physical contact is much 'powerful' than online contact in enhancing relationships. Therefore, the relationship among family members is more closer than the relationship among friends, so family has stronger influence.

In sum, family does not change, exists for everyone, and contacts physically, unlike friends. Therefore family is the most important influence on young adults. However, this does not mean friendship is not important for young adults. We have to maintain good relationships among families and friends."	4	4	4	12
588	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"Most of people lives in society and connected with many people. Family and friends are the closest people that people lives together in society. Since young adults are influenced by both family and friends, there exists a debate with who influence young adults more. Some people might believe that family influence on young adults most importantly, but I think friends are the most important influence on young adults because of 2 reasons.
First, people learn how to speak well in society by talking with friends. Young adults in Korea were educated by elementary school, middle school, and high school essentially. These schools are the society that people first join in their lives. Therefore, people learn how to speak with others in society by talking with friends in school. Thus, because people learn the society from friends in school, friends are the most important influence on young adults.
Next, friends are easier to talk about secrets. Since friends have similar hobbies, people can talk with them friendly. For an example, students prefer to talk about who they like with friends, not with family. Since parents are older than young adults, they lives in different environment with young adults. Hence, parents might not understand about young adults' secret. Therefore, they could think it is difficult to talk with family about their secret. Thus, since young adults learn many things from solving their secrets and friends are more acceptable to help it, friends are more important to influence young adults.
Some people who think that the family is the most important influence on young adults might say that family are more important because people live with their family for longest time. However, in my opinion, I think friends live with young adults as much as family. Young adults live with friends during school, playtime, and also after studies. Thus, without sleeping time, friends also live with young adults for a long time, so they are still most important influence.
Because of the above reasons, I think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. In nowadays, there are many unpredictable situations in society. If the problems happen from those situations, young adults can be difficult to solve the problems. Thus, I hope young adults to learn how they should act in those situations by enjoying society with their friends first."	4	4	4	12

Use examples to support your position.	"""Tell me your friends, and I will tell you your future"" is the brilliant proverb that is applicable to many life examples. Older generations may think that family plays important factor for their children' development, but I think friends influence overweight it. In this essay, I will try to explain my point clearly.
To begin with, starting from age five children go to kindergartens and their they make their first or maybe life long friends. Unfortunately, it is only beginning of their long academic life which takes fifteen to twenty years of their live and matches with period when children develop mental and physical characteristics. The circle of friends will visit places, or talk about things that are common to majority of its members. Therefore, they will shape your taste, mindset and lots of other things in background. For instance, some families are not interested on the events on sports or not eager to play football at weekends as a family. Nevertheless, one of children might grow up as a professional football player which is uncommon to this family. We might even encounter to someone who do not follow family heritage such as company or handcrafting. Therefore, we see that, family has less influence to child than friends or environment. 
However, some people believe that family plays big  role on child development. They think that child lives with their parents and siblings and spend most of time with them, consequently, they should have more influence. However, we should also consider the fact that majority of parents are fully employed, so they have less time to spend with their children. Even in front of the meal table, children are busy with cell phones and parents with phone call which lowers the intensity of family interactions. Consequently, less interaction leads to completely unexpected results. 
To sum up, people might think that family influence more to young adults than their friends, however, statistically it is completely opposite. Therefore, with whom you spend most of your time will influence you the most."	4	4	4	12

Use examples to support your position.	"Young adults are people at the age that is crucially influenced by people around them. Since it is the age in between being a child and being an adult, many physical and mental changes occur during this age. Some people think that young adults are highly influenced by their families; however, friends have much more impact on them than family.

First, young adults are students in elementary and high school, so they spend most of their time with friends at school. They study, discuss, do group work, and do their hobbies together. Most of young adults spend extra time with their friends after school and during weekends to do extracurricular activities such as music clubs and sports day activity. Moreover, students have to work with friends on group presentations and team projects, so they have to spend more time with friends. Because most of the time young adults has is spent with friends, friends is an important factor that affect people at this age.

Second, young adults want to be accepted in a particular community; in other words, they want to feel that they belong to a particular group. As a result, they conform to those communities and friends in order to be accepted. For example, if one wants to be accepted by a school football team, he might practice playing football harder and enhance his skill to prove that he belongs to the team. However, young adults do not have to change their behaviors or prove their abilities to be accepted by family. For this reason, sense of belonging with a community of friends affect a young adult more than family.

Third, most people are more comfortable to communicate with those who are at the same age or the same generation with them. Likewise, young adults feel more comfortable to talk to friends than family because they think that friends can relate with their situations than family could. Sometimes, family does not understand the circumstances and problems that a teenager has experienced because of the generation gap. Therefore, it is easier to be empathized by friends since friends understand with those situations better.

In conclusion, family has an influence on young adults, but the most important influence is friends because young adults spend most of their time with friends, and they want to be accepted to a particular community. Moreover, they feel more comfortable to talk to people at the same generation. For these reasons, friends influence on young adults than family."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
591	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"Human is an animal of society. During one human's lifetime, there will be a significantly large number of social interaction between people such as conflicts, debates, agreements, etc. In this viewpoint, some people say that the family is the most important influence on young adults, the other say friends are the most important influence on young adults. Each of two viewpoint is reasonable, but I agree with the latter one; friends are the most important influence on young adults.

First, we can meet a lot of friends who have different mind. This means there is higher possibility to experience more relationships between people. In relationship between people such as family, friends, or colleagues, there are a significant number of different situations. For example, planning for travel is the most common situation. Suppose that you have to plan for trip with your friends. Some of your friends may want to set the plan with the complicated schedule, and others may want to travel with direct plan in your travel place. Another example is, the MBTI test. MBTI test distinguishes people's characteristics in 16 kinds, and everyone can see what is the most similar characteristics to their's. This means, in your family, you can see only few kinds of MBTIs, whose number is same as the number of your family. However, with your friends, I can tell you that you can meet the various kinds of MBTI.

Next point is about sociality. Although some people says that the family is the most important influence on young adults in perspective of education of social characteristics, I argue that friends are the better. That's because, it is the case of young adults. I also agree with the family is one of the most important component, but it is usually in the case of infants. Think about our infants, we can easily think about the less opportunity to meet the other people; on the other hand, when we make friends, as I told above, we can have more opportunity to meet people who have different characteristics. Think about your family's conflict in decision-making. It will have the similar steps to solve the problem. In my case, when my family have different opinion in something, we usually talk about the pros for each opinion. However, when I have to talk about the different opinion with my friends, I usually thnk about not only the pros, but also the cons for each opinion. These different way to talk will be very helpful to raise our sociality.

Third, we can do a lot of experiences with friends rather than with our family. Usually the group of similar ages can have the common interests easier. For example, most of the male teenagers like to play computer games or play sports, most of the female teenagers have interests in cosmetics. Similarly, I will suggest my case about that I can talk with more variety subjects with my friends. Our parents and my younger brother don't know about the recent issue in sciences. About the recent issues in science, it is easier to talk with our friends rather than my family. Because my friends in KAIST all have the similar interests in sciences. This means that most of my friends search the recent scientific issue, and it is easier to talk about some subjects.

Today, I argued that the friends are the most important influence on young adults with three viewpoints, which are the opportunity to meet a lot of people who have different mind, sociality, and the more various experiences. With your friends, you can easily have the most valueable experience in your lifetime, and it will be your foundation about your relationship, decision in your lifetime impliedly."	4	4	4	12

Use examples to support your position.	"  Who gives you the most important influence when you are young adults? The answers are divided into two groups, family and friends. Although some people argue that family is the most important influence on young adults, I support that friends are the most important influence on young adults for following reasons.
  First, young adults have responsibility to construct their own life. While became adults, young adults have responsibility of what they do. They consider their future with their friends, rather than family, because there are little difference in parents generations and their generations. The relationship was occurred when the talk between people are more fluently. Therefore, young adults more talk with their friends with their future, and these talk with productive content will influence their future life such as company society. Famous sentence that 'when judging someone, see their friends' also think relationship between friends are more influence on each person's life.
  Second, young adults take more time with their friends rather than family. However, some people argue that young adults also take time with their family after the class like teenagers, so family that live in same places give more influence on young adults. But, the most difference between teenagers and young adults is university. While teenagers become adults, most of young adults go to university, and they are participate in lots of activities occurred in university. They active more fluent without adults' opinions such as which class take part in, which festival take part in. Therefore, if the time that live with someone is increasing, the relation between them also more friendly. 
  For the reasons above, I support that friends are the most important influence on young adults. When the time of young adults, they wonder about future with their friends with more time with what they learned in the time of teenagers, then they became responsible adults."	4	4.5	4	12.5

Use examples to support your position.	"In modern era, a crucial issue about  the cause of affecting positive/negative effect to young adults is discussed by many people. Some people believe that the family is the most important influence on young adults, while other people claim that friends are the most important influence on young adults. In this essay, I argue that the family is the most important influence on young adults for some reasons.

 First, family is the rest place of mind for many people.  In many times, people try to join the groups like friends(it is not exception), clubs, etc. in social networks. Many people want to make these relationships, and in lots of situation, they may get some stress from these situations. However, family is the only group that people join without some trying. It can make many people comfortable, and it can also decrease the stress from social relationships because of the reaction of blocking relationship from outside. Therefore, family can make the most important influence to many people.

 Second, family is the base of behavior for many people. For many people, the house and family is the base of many social or rest behavior. For example, many young adults sometimes play outside with friends, trip to out of local place, and etc., and they almost  think about the effect of family or house in the first of planning. It can be the clue to the opinion in this essay.

 Despite these specific logical  reasons for my opinion, some people still claim that friends make most important influence to young people because of the group that share most times to play with and the group that share their active or hobby. Although these reasons are also valid opinions, I still argue that the family is the most important influence to young adults because family also share their hobbies like ""family picnic"", and they are the main people to know many people's mind and pain.

 In conclusion, although friends is the important influence to young adults because of the group that share the most times to play with and the group that share their active and hobby, family is the main influence to young people because family is the rest place of mind and the base of behavior for many people. In addition, family also give great positive effect to study to many students in schools or universities. Then, how about to go to your family and explain about their positive effect with ""Thanks""?

Use examples to support your position.	"    People in early 20s feel confused because of the changes around them. They start to learn how to take responsibilities, how to work efficiently, and how to live without their parents. While this little chaos in their mind lasts, two groups, family and friends, will influence to the young. People often debate with the importance of each groups. I believe that friends are the most important influence on young adults.
    First of all, 20s spend more time for exciting and creative activities with their friends than with their families. Video games and sports are popular and common hobbies to men age of 20s. Obviously, their families can enjoy the games or play the sports. However, the absolute number of people who like to play the games or sports is deficient, so youngs can not fully enjoy the games only with their families. Therefore, young adults hang out with their friends more so that they are influenced more from their friends.
    Another important reason is that early 20s are also adults. They can think, decide on their own, and take responsibilities of their behaviors. This means they can choose the important influencers for their future. For me and my friends, almost all of us choose friends who will influence to our lives. I believe that many people will also choose friends.
    Some people might say that young adults are completely dependent to their families in financial sides, so they are influenced more by their families. It is true that most of early 20s do not have enough abilities to earn money themselves. Nevertheless, if young adults are trees, their families are ground and root under them. They can support and even give some influence to them, but they cannot change them. The way they will be grown up is decided by people who they will meet in the future, not in the past.
    So there are two big reasons why friends are the most important influencer to young adults. First one is the time usage, and second one is they are not just kids. I hope that people can change their views to early 20s; though early 20s are not fully grown up in physical, mental sides, they are also not kids."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
595	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"Almost every students in university are young adults. They spend their time with friends, family, professors to gain something good. 'Something good' can be happiness, joy, money or knowledge. While spending hours with other people, they are being similar with each other. In this situation, who are the most important influence on young adults? I think the answer is 'friends'. Friends influence on young adults each other a lot. This essay will show readers why they are most important.

The first reason is amount of time with each other. Almost every young adults spend there leisure time only with friends. In fact, university students in Korea spend almost 50% of their time on leisure time. The quantitative time of spending hour with friends is very big, so friends are the most important influence on each other. In KAIST, students are living in there own dormitory, not in there house. So they use almost 100% of their time with friends, so they are being similar with each other. This can be a nice example.

Second, amount of talk with friend is the most. We are living in the 'age of smart phone', so huge wave of information flows all around the world. As people catch that wave from SNS when the information is born, it is hard to make talk subject between SNS lovers and someone who don't interests in SNS. SNS lovers only talk about trend, and the others only talk about the past. That situation can be held in family. However, young adult friends have same talk source because almost every students uses SNS. This makes young adults to talk with only each other, so they influence each other a lot. That makes friends are the most important influence.

The third reason is no generation gap is existing between friends. Many 50 years old people loves mountain walking, many 30 years old people likes baseball and almost every 10 years old people loves smart phone games. This generation gap makes them being similar with only each other who have same hobby. As there is no hobby between friends, they are the most important influence with each other.

There are no generation gap between friends, and quantitative amount of spending time with friend is very big. As they talk with friends more than their family, young adults are being similar with each other, so they are the most important influence for themselves. However, only talk with same generation is not good point. Older people can gives us how to live, and young children can gives us hope and new technology. It is important to talk with other generation so that we can grow up as a good adult."	3.5	4.5	4	12

Use examples to support your position.	"Recently, many crimes done by the teenagers and young adults are increasing. Many experts and citizens are arguing about the importance of the peoples who are influencing the young adults.  Due to the situations, the debate who are the most important influence on young adults had made and spread to the whole world. The majority of citizens think the people who give the most influence are friends or families. Still, there is a debate between the friends and families from the question, who most influence the young adults. Many people argue friends are the most important, but families are the most important people who influence the young adults.

The key reason which families are the most important influence on young adults is young adults still got influenced by the events which involves family. As an example, when the closest friends of people who is in family died, all of the families has higher chance of getting influenced and get distracted from the jobs which they were focusing at.  Adding to previous example, the illness of the people in the family will make the other peoples in the family urgent which will have a huge influence one the young adults in the family, which even can result a enormous affect to the young adults.

Second, even after human become young adult, the lifestyle of the families can affect its lifestyles. Many young adults are spending majority of times with their family nowadays, making the lifestyle of young adult dependent to lifestyle of families.  As an example, the time when the young adults wake up is affected by families waking up time usually, due to the distraction of sleep which is made by families. Additionally, because their is a culture ""the dinner should be eaten with somebody else"" in Korea, the time which young adults eats dinners is often affected by the families.

However, some groups might argue isn't the activities made by friends influence the young people most, which means friends gives the most important influence to the young adults. However, most of the young adults spend most of their times with families, which families must had influenced the young adults with respect to the number of event they met. Additionally, even though some of the events from friends might influenced the young adults; majority of events which is memorable and has the huge impact are usually made by the families. 

In conclusion, because of high percentage of being affected to the lifestyle of families and high percentage of being affected to the events which involves family, the family is the group who gives the most important influence to the young adults. Still both families and friends give young adults sufficient events which will make young adults more improved. Hoping young adults to have a good relationship with both families and friends."	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5

"  Of all discussions that surface in contemporary society, the debate over which is the most important influence on young adult among family and friends is controversy. Although some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults, I think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. There are several reasons can support my thinking.
  First, many young adults usually spend much more time with their friends than family. Young adults can leave their home when they are accepted in college or employed in company. Moreover, they located far away from their family when they go to another regions to study or work. In this sequence, they should interact more time with their friends and coworker, but they could not interact much time with their family. This phenomenon decrease family's influence on young adults and increase friend's influence on young adults.
  Second, when they entered in new society, and they can approach to new thing that can change them. Once they grow to adult, they can feel freedom because barriers that they can't enjoy in their childhood are broken. And then, they approach to sensational thing when they couldn't study and feel. In addition, in almost case, friends are near by young adults, not family. It is because they interact many time with their friends.
  Lastly, they would like to tell their worries and determination to friend, not their family. Young adults have behaviors to hide their consideration to their parents and brothers(or sisters) because they passed away their childhood. So it makes they are want to interact their friends, not family.
  In conclusion, young adults can be influenced more by friends than family because they spend more time with their friends and they not want to share their consideration with their family. "	4	4	3.5	11.5

Use examples to support your position.	"  There are various topics to debate around the world, and one of the topics is which one among friends and family is the most important influence on young adults. Although some people might say that family is the most important influence on young adults, I believe that friends are the most important influences.
  First, once people become young adults, much more options become available to them. For example, they now can drink alcohols, buy a new cell phone number without their parents, and even rent a car. Some of the young adults begin to live without their family. As a result, the young adults do more activities outside without their family; eventually, they are affected by other people, namely friends.
  Despite this reason, still some people think that family is the most important influence as young adults are taught by their family before becoming adults. Indeed, it is obviously true; however, it also should be considered that it is the environment that changes each person. They might learn something from their family, but they soon are exposed more to their friends.
  For the reasons given above, I insist that friends are the most important influences on young adults. Although family and friends are both important, but now I wonder: How do you think about this topic?"	2.5	3	3	8.5

Use examples to support your position.	"  These days, it is controversial that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Although some people argue that the friends are the most important influence on young adults, I believe that the family have a greater effect on young adults than students. The two ideas stated below can be valid evidence to support my view.
 First of all, the relationship with family is permanent, unlike the relationship with friends may be temporary. If people get into the new group consists of strangers, they are likely to make new friends and forget about their friends in past. However, people can't forget their family because their family will never change. Since people can't simply add or delete their family, it is not unusual that many people think their relationship with family is much more important than their relationship with friends. For example, there is a famous Korean saying that ""Happiness in your house is the most important value in your life."" It means there is nothing better than making a good relationship with family.
 Moreover, family knows you better than any other people. In fact, all people have watched their children since their children born. As parents have taken care of their babies for a long time, they can know all about their children such as hobby, characteristics. For example, many parents can even predict what their children think about by just looking at the face of their children.
 Despite ample reasons in support of the argument in this essay, some people claim that friends are the most important influence on young adults because people meet their friends more frequently in general. However, meeting frequently is not enough to make a better relationship with friends than their family. For example, in my experience at high school dormitory, most students prefer talking with their parents through the phone rather than talking with their friends in face-to-face after exam finished. This means that many people usually want to share their feelings with their family, not their friends.
 In conclusion, I believe that the family is the most important influence on young adults for the reasons that I have mentioned above. In COVID-19 situation, the importance of relationship with other people has been increasing significantly. As more people stay at their home, they got more chance to make a good relationship with their family."	4	4	4	12

Use examples to support your position.	"The young adult is the important period that decides the personalities. And, they influenced easily by others. Some people think friends are the most important influence. However, young adult influenced mostly by a family with some supporting reasons.
 One of the reason is that young adult spends more time with their family. Some people think that, the time spending on school is the much bigger than spending a home. But, the friends can easily change by becoming a higher grade or graduate the school. However, family cannot change. Since young adults mostly spending their time with their family, they learn a lot of things from their family. It make them to be similer with their family; for example, the personalities or habits.
 Second, only family can give advices. Most of friend want to keep good relationship with their young adults. Thus, they ususally avoid to talking about disadvantage. However, family are different. Family want their young adult to grow up as a good person. ItThe  is the main different from family and friends.  Although family punish or give advices,  young adults know that they really love.
 In the conclusion, the family is the most important influence on young adults. They spent more time with their family and family only can give good advice. For these reason, the role of the adult for the young adult is very important."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Use examples to support your position.	"Over half million of children are graduating the school every year in Korea, and are starting their adult life. People are wondering who are the most important group of people for those young adults. Althought some people think the most important influence on young adults is from their family, however, my oppinion is the most imporatant influence on young adults is from their friends.

First, young adults have stronger relationship of influence with their friends than their family because young adults are spending most of their childhood time with their friends. In the South Korea, children are going to school for about 16 years that includes an elementary school, a middle school, a high school, and an university. And during a day time, children spend more than 12 hours for studying and exercising in the school with their friends. Therefore, children have to spend most of time with their friends. Consequencly, after students graduate universities, young adults will form a strong understanding among a their age group when young adults enter the society. For example, young adults who are between 20 and 30 years old, have a hugly different pollitical oppinion than a 50, 60 years old age group that is mostly their parent and family will be contained.

Secondly, since many families have only a one child or two children per family, children have to talk and play with their friends in a school rather than their family. Thus, children will make many relationships with their friends because there are only old adults in their family. Since young adults have a long time with their friends during their lifetime than their family usually, young adults would have huge influences from their friends.

Despite many evidences that given in this essay, some people think the family has a big role for young adults because old adults can support and lead young adults during entering society. However, supporting of family is not happening and supporting of family is extreamly hard to do in these days. In the past, families are usually significantly bigger than current. For example, grand parants, parents, childrens and families of sibilings of parents group were formed a single huge family in the past. However, in these days, those huge scale family is unusual. Since most of family structures have only parents and children usually, therefore parents have to have enough social power to lead their children alone. Unfortunatly, existence of enough social power to lead children is might not true for everyone, because parents are already in suffering to live in the harish society. Despite there is a complexity of leading children in real world, helping each other young adults by sharing information are reletivly easier.

In conclusion, by many supporting evidences that provided in this essay, young adults have significance influence from their friends. Friends of young adults can understand and help each other. In these days, friends who met during school life will be part of life partener for young adults. Therefore, please take care about own friends."	5	5	4.5	14.5

     Do you remember your childhood? Most of KAIST student may begin education at a very early age. But it is very hard for children. In short term, it has many positive point such as good at English, and entering the great university. But in long term, it has many negative point about communication and stress. When the children learn about formal things, they can not  learn the other things. So there are two reasons of why children use their time to play and why they should not start study early; to learn how to communication, to learn to how to get stress low.  
     First, people can not learn about their friend link without playing. People learn many things in their childhood. And the age of people when learning something is very important because some part of brain grow only in specific age. When people was young, it is the season to learn communication. If jump it and learn the other one such as English, math, and science, it means that they lose their chance to learn communication. 
     Next, when the children become adult, they will burn-up. If they start learn early, they can not spend their time to play until they will dead. They get stress but they do not know how to enjoy their free time. But the people who playing when they young know how to get stress low and how to use their free time. They have release state then people who start study early. In my case, most of my friends started formal education at early age. And most of them hate the study and do not study anymore because of stress. 
      In short, young children should spend their time to play. Because they learn how to communicate with their friends  or team members for playing in the chlidhood. And  they learn how to get low stress form their work to playing. So, every children should spend their time to play and they have right about play."	4	4	4	12
603	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"  As modern young grown-ups are communicating with various people including not only family but also friends, opinions whether the former has the most important influence on young adults or the latter does are divided into two groups. Even though some people state that the family is the most important influence on young adults, friends are the most important influence on young adults.
  Above of all, young people are more likely to interact with their friends than family. Since most of them are university students, they may usually  stand on their own; that is, they live apart from their family. Rather, they are prone to get along with their friends. For example, a large number of KAIST students who dwell in dormitories join clubs, which offer a variety of activities with their friends. I heard that some of them eventually establish a start-up, but there are few companies founded with one's family.
  Next, friends may have similar points of view. According to a research conducted by numerous psychologists, groups of people consisted of members who had spent their young ages in similar era are inclined to share common points of view. Therefore, young grown-ups can easily share their ideas and feel a kind of sympathy with their friends.
  Meanwhile, some people insist that the family have a great impact on young adults, based on the amount of time that young people had spent with family. However, adults make their own way by experiencing various events and conducting several roles in our society with friends. In other words, the time spent with family does not ultimately determine one's points of view.
  For the reasons suggested above, young adults are mainly affected by their friends than their family. Thus, try to interact with a number of good friends as many as possible."	4	4	4	12
604	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"    Who is the most influencing person to young adults? It is a very big controversy between people. Some people think family influences more, but others think friends are more influencing young adults. In my perspective, friends are the most important influence on young adults; because they can share deeper concerns, and also they can provide new opinions on their lives.
    First of all, young adults can share deeper concerns with friends. While growing up, every person suffers from numbers of situations and changing environments among them; however, they cannot share all the concerns with family. For instance, if someone had a problem with classmates, family cannot help effectively for her, even if they knows the fact. Family can just wish and see if the situation between classmates and daughter is getting better. In contrast, as a friend, they can help in various ways, such as having lunch with her, talking to classmates. Like this example, some concerns that cannot be handled by family occurs to people; for this reason, young adults share these with friends instead of family. During this period, Young adults share happiness, sadness, and numerous emotions with friends. Talking about lots of situations, which cannot be shared with family, makes friends as the most important influencing people on young adults.
    Next, friends can provide a new perspective on young adult's life. Some people may say that because family knows many things about young adults, family can give good effect on them compared to friends. In other words, this statement also means that person does not change because they are not able to get new opinions of problems. Young adults need to learn and think whether some situations or opinions are right or wrong. By debating with friends in daily life, they can get influenced by each other, because they share their own perspectives about problem, no matter it is good or bad. Typically friends are grown from different environments and have different stories of life, this is more affecting factor for young adults who has to experience numerous things in limited time.
    To sum up, there were two reasons why friends influence most on young adults. Because they can share deeper concerns, and they can give new perspectives to each other, friends are more important in influencing young adults compared to family."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
605	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"  We need love from family than friends

  Both of family and friends effects to making personalities on young adults. We can learn how to communicate or live in society by them easily. Although they are mandatory elements of learning and adjusting to be an adult and have responsibilities, I believe that young adults need more family's love than friendships. There are three reasons why I argue family's love.
  First, young adults can feel love easily, quickly and longer than friends. There are many kinds of love in the world. people can love someone to marry, be friends or friendships. Also, all kinds of love need some attitude for opponents so people should learn how to love and act for others. Then, there are educations by many experiences and love from family can give that experiences. People met when they were born and live together  until be an adults. Therefore, family can give most of experiences to learn love.
  Second, family take care of person when they hurt or feel bad. People cannot be happy every times. Sometimes, people fought we others or felt really bad because of love. Not only mental problems but also physical problems. People can hurt by diseases or accidents. If people hurts by mental or physical problems, only family can care. Although family members have their lives and works, they will care their family members excepts other works. On the other hands, friends cannot help taking care of friends easily. Because they have their works and if they do not continue their lives, finally their family are hurt. This is why people usually use words'blood is better than water'. 
  Third, people met and made relationships or friendships less times than family. When people meet friends, when they complete meeting, they go home. This means although people have many works, meetings and things to do, people come back home. They feel belonging in the family because they always live with family. On the contrary, people want to meet friends, need to make meeting schedules and opportunities to make friends.
 To sum up, I believe that people need family more than friends. There are three reasons why I argue. They are love, care, and belonging from long times. Of course, I think young adults need both of elements to make personalities and attitude for love. Although there are people who believe young adults need friends than family, I argue that young adults need family."	4	5	5	14
606	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"      Among the many debates, it is increasingly important whether the family is the most important influence or the friends are the most important influence. Although some people argue that people get the most important influence by the time that spends with the family when people are very young, I believe that friends are the most important influence on young adults for the following reasons.
     First of all, people spend most of their time with their friends. As time spends, the time that spends with friends is gradually longer, but the time that spends with the family is gradually shorter. Thus, people and their friends support and believe each other in young adults, and they can affect each other.
     Second, people can share more hobbies with friends than family. Because people usually have the same age as their friends, there is no generation difference; therefore, they can share many hobbies and they can know easily what friends like. Because they do these things together, they can have many chances to talk deeply and this can affect each other.
     Despite ample evidence represented in this essay, some people claim that people get the most important influence by the time that spends with the family when people are children. However, I think that it can be changed as they grow up. For example, some people who are the prisoner are affected by mantors, realize their faults and change their minds to live kind. 
     In conclusion, the most important influence on young adults is friends."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
607	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"Whether to hire an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or to hire an experienced worker at a higher salary is a significant debate to employers throughout various fields. Some argue that hiring an inexperienced worker is more helpful, however, I believe hiring experienced worker is the better choice. 
 The most essential reason that hiring an experienced worker is better is the ability to handle troubles. The experienced workers have their strengths in overcoming various crisis. Also, they hardly make mistakes as well. Since there always exists unexpected situations, working with the experienced ones will provide stability to the manager. 
 In addition to the trouble-handling ability, the scarcity of experienced worker is another reason. The higher salary is inevitable cost to hire the experieced ones, due to the law of supply and demand. The absolute number of the experienced workers is limited, which results in higher salary in this case. This tells us that the experienced workers are more preferred in most sitations . 
 Nevertheless, some insist that hiring inexperienced worker at a lower salary is more efficient to those having an hardtimes in budget. However, in most cases, experienced workers show higher effeciency than inexperienced workers. For example, a baseball club prefer a starplayer than a rookie player, eventhough owning a starplayer requires more cost. It is because there is another disguised limitation, the population. 
 The employer should hire the most essential and efficient employee under limited budget and population. Thus, hiring the experienced workers will be the best solution to those hesitating to make decisions."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
608	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"Over the last hundreds of years, there have been massive debates and arguments about whether hiring an inexperienced worker at a lower salary is better or hiring an experienced worker at a higher salary is better. Since both side have advantages and also disadvantages, it is hard to choose one of them. Some people insist that inexperienced workers with low salary are better to hire, I argue that experienced workers with high salary are much better to hire. 

First of all, people who believe that low salary workers are better insist that the low salary workers are better only because they can save money through low salary. However, I believed that the total outcome from experienced workers is higher than inexperienced worker. When we hire a experienced worker, we can save time for employees to get used to their jobs. At that time they can do their jobs and make more money. On the other hand, if we hire inexperienced worker, we have to teach them jobs and these will spend much time which means that they actually cost high. 

In addition to the idea that hiring experienced worker, my company can become more reliable and comfortable when I hire a experienced worker. For example, there are two hamburger restaurant. Restaurant A has an inexperienced worker, so it takes a long time to make a hamburger and if you ask some question about restaurant, he can not answer to your question. In contrast, Restaurant B has an experienced worker who takes minutes to make a high quality hamburger and if you ask some question about restaurant, answer to all of your question. Customers would like the B restaurant and B might earn money. 

Finally, experienced workers can make our company better than before. They know the problems of the company because they worked at similar job or same company for long years. Employers may ask questions to them but not to inexperienced worker. These answers to the question may result in increase of the quality of company and this company might become a better one when employer accept them. 

As aforementioned paragraph precisely describe, I want my employees to become more professional. I do prefer workers with many experience and low salary but these workers do not exist in real world. Thus, we need to select one of employees. Which one do you prefer?"	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
609	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"By choosing specific kind of employee, the future of the group determine. So, hiring the worker is the important roles of the employer. If there are an inexperienced worker at a lower salary and an experienced worker at a higher salary, I would choose an inexperienced worker. Therefore, I would like to introduce why hiring an inexperienced worker is better than an experienced worker at a higher salary.
 The first reason is difference of passion. Most of An inexperienced workers do not know about our work at all, however an inexperienced workers try to do their best. Then, if they keep try to do that, they will make good results. But, some experienced workers think that they master already in this field, so they have no effort to do better.
 The second reason is potential ability. The experienced workers already reach their limit. But, the inexperienced workers do not meet their limit yet, and they have a potential ability that the inexperienced workers work better than the experienced workers. In addition, we can hire the inexperienced workers at a much lower salary.
 Finally, most of inexperienced worker is young. It is good to know about current trends. Also, if I hire the inexperienced workers now, there remain many times to work with them.
 To conclude, If I am an employer, I will hire the inexperienced workers because their passion and potential abilities is very efficient."	3	3	3	9
610	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"It is a great worry for most of employers to choose proper workers they will work together with. Some employers choose to hire inexperienced workers at a lower salary and help them develop as a better worker in the process of co-working. However, I would prefer to hire an experienced workers regardless of their higher salaries if I were an employer. 
 The main keyword of the reason why I would choose an experienced worker at a higher salary is 'efficiency'. Here, efficiency can both include short term views and long term views. To begin with the short term view, people might think that the money required for working with an employee with lower salary will be much lower than working with an employee with higher salary. However, the thing people missed here is the costs that we need for educating an inexperienced worker and build basic foundation for them. So if the money required for starting works with either types of workers differs in not significant range, it will be much better to work with experienced workers.
 Next in the long term perspective, it is more efficient and helpful to work with workers who knows well about the working field than beginners. There is an example that I experienced in my high school ages. I was a head of one design club in my school and worried about what criteria  I should consider when choosing new club members. I discussed together with club members  and concluded to choose new members regardless of their abilities but to consider their passion about our club. As a result, there were only a few new members who were talented in creating new designs and others were not possible to create any design works. We were not able to produce sufficient new designs thus were hard to sell our products to gather 
money for donation. From this experience, I learned that hiring workers with adequate experiences are really important when hiring workers.
 Nevertheless, people might say that inexperienced workers have potentials to work well and they could be much more passionate than experienced workers. But I think that is kind of random problem because their argument also implies that inexperienced workers can be really bad at working. Also, the experienced workers are also workers who already showed their potential to previous workplace they were hired to. In other words, they are ensured professionals. Lastly, to rebut to the idea that the inexperienced workers will be more passionate, I think worker's passion doesn't differ according to if they experienced the workplace or not. There are many professional workers who are still passionate and curious about their work field.
 To conclude, as aforementioned paragraphs show, I think hiring experienced workers at a higher salary is much more better because it is more efficient in both short term and long term aspects in ruling the workplace. Although a high salary might work as an obstacle in hiring experienced workers, the experienced workers will do well in the workplace."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
611	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"Nowadays almost of businesses use numerical workers. Therefore, in the employer's perspective, hiring employee is very important problem. People keep argue which worker is better between lower salary inexperienced worker and higher salary experienced worker. Although hiring inexperienced worker is cheaper than hiring experienced worker, i might hire experienced worker. There are several supporting reasons.

The most essential reason that we need to hire experienced worker is effectiveness. The reason employer employ worker is business. They want to earn more money more comfortably by hiring workers. However, its hard to solve this hope by hiring inexperienced worker. Employer need to educate inexperienced worker longer than experienced worker. Since employer concentrate in educating worker, effectiveness decreases.  Therefore, effectiveness of work can not be improved.

In addition to effectiveness, hiring inexperienced worker is too risky. For the case of experienced worker, they might be a expert of this work and successfully adapted in this world. In contrast, inexperienced worker never experienced this work and society. Therefore, hiring them has risk that new workers are bad at work or fail to adapt at company.

Nevertheless, some people still believe hiring inexperienced worker is better because there salary is cheap. However, by the low effectiveness and risk that inexperienced worker give bad impact to company. We can't say hiring inexperienced worker is cheaper.

As aforementioned paragraphs clearly delineate, hiring experienced worker is better than the other one. Nowadays, one by one person is very precious and important. Therefore, we should hire worker more"	4	4	4	12
612	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"Many companies want to bring benefit in markets. So, companies hire great workers to win in competition. But companies also want to minimize money to spend on workers. Of all discussion that surface in society, the debate over whether it is better to hire an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary remains contentious. Although some people claim that hiring an inexperienced worker at a lower salary is better, I believe that hiring an experienced worker at a higher salary help company's growth.
The most essential reason that experienced workers work efficiently. Experienced workers learned properties of working area, and experienced various programs to work in previous companies.
In addition to the notion that experienced workers work efficiently, experienced workers know how hang out with company's people. Communication is an important element to solve problems. Experienced workers already experienced society life. So, experienced workers feel more comfortable when experienced workers talk each other.
As aforementioned paragraphs clearly  delineate, hiring an experienced worker at a higher salary is better to grow company. Hiring an experienced worker is more important than spending higher salary."	2.5	2.5	3	8

Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"It has been issued what kind of people does employer hires. There are many opinions about hiring an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary, and many people think hiring an experienced worker at a higher salary, but I think hiring an inexperienced worker at a lower salary is better. There are three reasons.
 First, lots of works are determined by employer, not employee. For example, in case of food stores, lots of things like menu, amount of foods are determined by employer.  If employer runs larger company, there are several teams that determined the problems in company too. So the employee's opinions don't have power between them.
 Second, many people think that the efficiency of an experienced worker at a higher salary is more better. But I think that it is wrong. It is because the society is changing very fast. So, if I hires experienced worker as a higher salary, but the society changes and the company don't need them, it will be more inefficiency. For example, in case of programmer, if new computer language made, the programmer between experienced worker and inexperienced worker are very small.
 Last, there are not large difference between them because the criteria of hiring was higher and higher these days. In past, some people can do English very well. But nowadays, English is essential for everyone and lots of people can do English very well. I think there are many supply than demand. Therefore, I think difference between inexperienced worker and experienced worker are not enormous.
 To sum up, lots of works are determined by employer, the world changes fast, and there are not large difference between them, so I think hiring an inexperienced worker at a lower salary is better. Why don't we hire between them determining by what kind of parts they works?"	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
614	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"    The ability of workers who I need to employ may varies from the kind of job and work. In my case, I'll suppose that my job is software developer and I want to employ some application developers. In this case, I want to employ the latter case of worker, the experienced worker at a higher salary. There are some reasons that I want to employ experienced worker, the property of my job, the bond of company.
    To explain about the standard to select the worker, it is needed to explain about the property of my job. Team-work is the key to success in software developing area. 
Each workers should understand their own job in many points. For example, they should be able to give their creative ideas and give feedback for their coworkers. Moreover, they must be capable of realize that idea into real developing which needs expertises and coding experience. 
    For the second reason that I want to employ, we have to understand the contrasting point with inexperienced worker at a lower salary. Although there are some people that insists inexperienced worker at a lower salary is much more effective, I think experienced worker may show the efficiency over them. In addition, I think consisting a company means consisting a family. experienced workers may have bondage between coworker because the employer believe in them.
    From the reasons I mentioned above, I think experienced worker at a higher salary is better. They can satisfy the property of my job, give efficiency of their works, make bondage in our company. So I'd like to make company that has strong foundation from high experienced workers , ultimately."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"There are many employers now, and also there are many workers. And they are divided two types of workers. 

Some people are inexperienced workers at a lower salary, and other people are experienced workers  at a higher salary. 

Some employers want inexperienced workers at a lower salary because of money saving. However,  more money will 

be spent on training workers. So, If I am an employer, I prefer an experienced worker at a higher salary because of 

efficiency of work, sincerity of workers, and money and time saving. 

              First of all, work efficiency of an experienced worker at a higher salary is very nice. They are accustomed to 

work, so they can get things done quickly and win many better jobs and projects for the company. They can accomplish 

many for the company.

              Secondly, experienced workers are sincere. Of course, this is not to say that inexperienced workers at a lower 

salary are not conscientious. However, since experienced workers  at a higher salary are paid high salary, they work 

harder and work diligently. So, they work more passionately than other inexperienced workers at a lower salary.

              In addition to work efficiency and sincerity, Hiring experienced workers is a way to save time and money. 

Experienced workers do not need any training because they have work experience. This saves time and money to train 

workers. Also, they work done quickly based on their experience, which can be a huge benefit to their company in a 

short  time.
 
              In conclusion, I believe experienced workers  at a higher salary are better workers to hire because of three 

reasons. They have work experience, so they can work efficiently. And they work more sincerely because of high salary. 

lastly, they do not need training, so employers can save money and time. In the other words, it is better to hire 

experienced workers!"	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"  Nowadays, many people work hard to get their job. So their are many kinds of workers. For example, someone may be an experienced worker, while another one is an inexperienced worker. Usually, employer give more salary to experienced worker than inexperienced worker, so some employers may prefer to hire the inexperienced one. But, when choosing one of two workers, employer should hire the experienced worker.
  There are many reasons why employer choose the experienced worker. First, because they have many experiences about their working area, the experienced worker can adapt easily to their new works, and they can do their work better than inexperienced workers. In particular, in a programming company like game company, the one who already experienced to make game not only can do many things, but also has creative idea that others do not have.
  Second, some employers may argue that hiring inexperienced workers is beneficial because of money problem, but the long-term benefit which experienced worker give to company by effective working process can be bigger than their higher salary. Also, hiring inexperienced workers may lead to spending more money due to teaching them about their works.
  Finally, it is important to find experienced worker because nowadays, world is 
  Many employers want to hire workers who can give the biggest benefit to company, and many employees want company which give a high salary to them. And it is true that employees can achieve it by studying and having an experience about the work for companies, and employers can achieve it by hiring well-experience workers."	3	3.5	3.5	10
617	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"All of the discussions whether to hire an inexperienced worker or experienced work is a problem to employees. Although some employees like to hire unexperienced worker with little money, there are some employees who like to hire experienced workers even thought giving more money. What I believe is, although giving little more money, experienced worker is better than unexperienced worker.

The most essential reason experienced worker is better than unexperienced worker is that experienced workers finishes their jobs without any problems. For example, unexperienced workers will have hard time and cause troubles because they do not know what to do. So, employees or experienced workers have to teach them how to finish the job. Unexperienced workers can even cause trouble which burden other worker or employees. Also, unexperienced workers might give up the job because they did not have any experience how hard the job is. They might just run away from work without any discussion. 

Nevertheless, some people still argue that unexperienced workers gain experience while working and after a month or two, they will work same as the experienced workers without any problem with little money. However, the cases of fast learning is rare and they might ask for more salary after gaining more experience.

As the aforementioned paragraphs clearly show, hiring experienced worker is better than unexperienced worker. Experienced worker has a lower chance of making trouble and less likely to run away from work compared to unexperienced worker. There was an argument that unexperienced worker can gain experience while working with little money, but the case of fast learning is rare and eventually they will get the same money if they gain more experience. So, I think hiring experienced worker is better than unexperienced worker."	4	4	4	12

Some people will prefer to hire an inexperienced worker at a lower salary. Though, I believe that hiring an experienced worker at a high salary will be better, and my view can be greatly substantiated by the reasons below.
Firstly, an experienced worker will make better results. Experiences make people professional. For example, there is a man who can wash one dish in 10 seconds. He was not that professional at first time but washing the dishes for 10 years made him use to it. He became skilled for 10 years of experience and that led him to the greater results.
Secondly, an experienced worker will save time. Because they already had done the same works before, they do not need time to learn the things work. Therefore, they can finish the job sooner than the inexperienced worker. According to the research in Korea, general companies run the internship program for more than 1 month. Imagine that you are running the general company. If you hire a inexperienced worker, you will end the project nearly 1 month later than the other companies which hire an experienced worker.
Nevertheless, some people would state that hiring an inexperienced worker is more economical because he or she works the same things at a lower salary. However, I argue that hiring an experienced worker can be more economical cause inexperienced worker usually do not works the same as experienced worker. He or she will need some time to learn about the works, and they will be clumsy. There is a word that saying 'Time is gold'. Experienced worker will save the time and gave us more profit. Hence, it will be economical.
In conclusion, I would prefer to hire an experienced worker at a high salary because it will led me to make better results and save time. Employer should choose the employee who is going to make the company earn more profit. And I think hiring an experienced worker is more convincing idea to"	4	4	4	12
619	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"Companies consist of lots of workers. That's because workers are necessary to lead the company's goal. Because the goal of the companies might different, workers who employer wants to hire can be different. But, experienced workers can make an achievement much valuable than investment and they're existence can gather lots of talented workers. So, I would prefer to hire an experienced worker at a higher salary if I were an employer. 

 First, experienced workers can make an achievement much valuable than investment. If company's size small, it can be a burden for them to hire the experienced worker. But, experienced worker might make result alone which needs 10 inexperienced worker to achieve. Inexperienced worker can have high intelligence or energy, they can't overcome the gap made by the technique from the experience. For example, there is a program that armies of Korea compete. There was a wrestle game and giant, strong soldier and experienced, but less stronger soldier fought. And the result was a victory of the experienced soldier. Other soldier was much stronger, but experienced soldier used tactics and easily won the match. In the case of company, it is same. Inexperienced workers can be smarter than experienced workers. But, experienced workers spend more time and energy in that field, and some of them cannot be replaced by the talent. So, even though it costs a lot for their salary, it is better to hire experienced worker.

 Second, experienced worker can gather lots of talented workers. If I hire experienced worker, two effects can be happened. First, company can make a great achievement by the ability of experienced worker. And this achievement will make company bigger. Bigger company must gather lots of new workers. For example, lots of talented students in KAIST wants to work in SAMSUNG. Because it is the biggest company in Korea. And, lots of talented human sources are hired every year in SAMSUNG. It grows and develops steadily. This cycle first generated by the lots of experienced workers in SAMSUNG. Next, it is same as the hiring of good tutor for lots of inexperienced worker. There must be a talented inexperienced worker who wants to learn by the experienced worker in company. And inexperienced workers can grow faster with the assistance of the experienced workers. So, if we hire experienced workers first, then we can make great environment for the further workers. To make the company bigger, it is necessary to hire experienced workers. 

 As a result, because experienced workers can give a much bigger profit compared to their salary, and they can make company bigger by gathering lots of talented workers, I would hire experienced worker even though I should pay higher salary. As an employer, the first thing I should care is development of the company. So, hiring experienced worker must be a perfect choice for it."	3.5	4	3.5	11

Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"Today, people are working in their own places to earn money. Some of them are employer, others are employee, and so on. As many people are work as an employee, many people have looked for a job. There will be experienced and inexperienced people who want to join the company, and experienced worker gets higher salary than inexperienced worker. If I am an employer, I would hire a mix of the two. But, if I need to pick just one of them, I would hire an experienced worker at a higher salary for some reasons.
First, I would hire an experienced worker at a higher salary because they are likely to be good at their job from the start. Of course, experienced worker have worked at similar work environment, and it means they can work skillfully with just a little of education. That's why an experienced worker will be able to do as much work as anyone else in the company soon, and even if he is paid a lot, he will benefit more from hiring a new inexperienced worker that the company's overall efficiency increases.
Next, I would hire an experienced worker at a higher salary because there is a high possibility of working for a long time. In the case of Inexperienced worker, soon after hiring, the job is not suitable or interesting, so he can find a job that suit for him. If it happens, there could be a situation in which he leaves the company without much actual work at a time when he has joined the company and virtually only education has been conducted. However, as the word ""experienced"" means that this person has done something similar, it would be rare for experienced people to leave the company for this reason. Also, they will remain in the company for a long time if we provide a better working environment and welfare as they moved from their previous jobs to ours. This could be better benefit to the company in long term.
In conclusion, if I become an employer, I should hire both inexperienced worker at a lower salary and experienced worker at a higher salary. But in the extreme, if I have to choose one of these, I will hire an experienced worker at a higher salary. The first reason was that they do not need to educate that much about work, and the second reason was that they are more likely to remain in the company for a long time."	4	4	4	12

Right after graduated, we are only 20's so we don't have many experiences and mature ability to work. We get little payment first and it increases as we become useful and matured. High salary means higher abilities and experienced worker. I prefer experienced worker at a higher salary than inexperienced worker.
 First, experienced worker works better. They have many experiences so they can finish works faster and do hard works easier than unexperienced worker. We employ workers to use their ability to develop our company. However, in case of inexperienced worker, we have to teach them and stack experience to work well. Until they are experienced enough, we can't assign important work to them. This is out of purpose that we employ workers. Experienced workers make less mistakes than unexperienced workers. If task that their assigning is important, little mistake can leads to bad result. 
 Next, we can grow some unexperienced worker with experienced worker. After we employ experienced workers, they can teach unexperienced workers. They can show how to process works and act in special cases. Experienced workers can give their experiences to unexperienced workers. In this way, unexperienced workers can grow much faster. It is efficient way to employ.  It means we need experienced worker first.
 Finally, experienced worker is more stable. They may work longer than unexperienced workers, because unexperienced workers don't have trust about their work. If work is hard or not suitable, their will go other company or find new jobs. However, experienced workers are people who are professional in each part. Most of them choose their way and will not change if there are not special reasons. It's better to work with one people long time than changing people every years. It can boost ability more and make synergy.
 In conclusion, I'd like to employ experienced worker because they work better, can grow unexperienced workers faster and they can long-run with us. For employer, employment is one of the important part. If they do mistake in employment once, they have to spend hard time before employ new employers. For convienent worklife, I recommend to employ mature employees who can work well and long."	4	4	3.5	11.5
622	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"  Many employers wonder what kind of people to hire. Some people claim that hire an experienced worker at a higher salary is better, but I think hiring an inexperienced worker at a lower salary is better. There are three reasons to support my opinion. 
  The most representative reason is low cost. We can hire more inexperienced workers than experienced workers in the same financial environment. It would be more efficient. Also, If the company has only experienced workers, each of them can have their own goal of work and different backgrounds. It can be difficult to coalesce their opinions into a single task. 
  In addition to the reason that lower cost is required,  there is also the reason that we can teach inexperienced worker. Employers and existing workers have advanced experience in their work. So, new inexperienced workers can learn and develop during the work by existing worker's teaching. And they can also teach the next new workers based on their experience. 
  Nevertheless, some people claim that hire an experienced worker is better. However, I think employers have to give a chance to inexperienced workers. Many companies prefer experienced workers because they already trained in their work. That is why inexperienced people are not given many opportunities. If this continues, a vicious circle can occur. 
  As clearly stated in the preceding paragraphs, hire an inexperienced worker at a lower salary is better than hire an experienced worker at a higher salary. Employers have to hire many inexperienced workers and give opportunities to them for the future."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
623	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"Nowadays, there are some hot issue about job. Most company in Korea prefer experience worker and they don't give the chances for inexperienced worker. It is true that an experienced worker is better than an inexperienced worker with same salary.  Thus, young people and inexperienced worker become hard to find work. If we have to pay more for experienced worker,  many people don't prefer experienced worker than inexperienced worker. However, if I was an employer, I would prefer to hire an experienced worker at a higher salary than an inexperienced worker at a lower salary for three reasons : ability, efficiency, and safety. 
 
First, experienced workers have better ability at work than inexperienced workers. Experienced workers are people who wanted from other companies. It means that they have something better than the others. Experienced workers also learned how to work before, so they know what is important, and they know appropriate work for the situation. So it is valuable for pay them more money.

Second, hiring an experienced worker at a higher salary is more efficient than hiring an inexperienced worker. When we hiring an inexperienced worker, we have to teach them how to work from beginning. And they also can't do work well during first few days. So someone have to work with an inexperienced worker, and it leads efficient to lower than hiring an experienced worker. 

Lastly, it is more safety that hiring an experienced worker than hiring an inexperienced worker. Experienced workers have less possibilities that they make trouble or bad issue about work. Experienced workers can overcome their trouble with their background knowledge that learned from their experience, but inexperienced workers can't do it. It may become a lose of our company. 

In conclusion,  I would prefer to hire an experienced worker at a higher salary than an inexperienced worker at a lower salary because experienced workers have better ability at work, hiring them is more efficient, and it is more safety for company.  These reasons explain why experienced workers are valuable to paid higher salary. Therefore, inexperienced workers who looking for work have to improve themselves to compete with experienced workers. Then, employers will noticed it, and try to hire them."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
624	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"Among the issues debated in the public, one of the most controversial topic is that hiring which kind of employee is the best choice. Although some people argue that hiring an experienced worker at a higher salary is the best choice, I claim that hiring an inexperienced worker at a lower salary is better.

 The first reason that hiring an inexperienced worker at a lower salary is better is that employers can hire a large number of employees. With the same amount of money, employer can hire more numbers of employees when hiring an inexperienced employees than hiring an inexperienced employees. Although a collection of employees is consist of an inexperienced people, they can create much more diverse values with workers that have diverse abilities and ideas than with a collection of workers with small mount of experienced people.

 The secondary reason that hiring an inexperienced worker is better is that the workers can think and behave more flexible because they have no experience in the field. Even though an inexperienced workers have less personalities than experienced workers, they would likely to be more actively acknowledge and demand others opinions and this would make the company more active conversations.

 On the other hand, some people argue that hiring an experienced worker at a higher salary is better for the reason that they don't need to instruct them when workers are stick to a project. However, I argue that although an inexperienced employees need some others' help to achieve some basic ability to work on, they can also create values with their own idea after educating some.

 As the above-stated paragraphs well describes, hiring inexperienced workers with a lower salary is better than hiring only some of experienced workers. When you are going to be a president of a company, you have to consider these advantages when hiring in experienced workers  to make the company better."	4	4	4	12

     The question has been raised so far with regard to whether an experienced worker with high salary is better than an inexperienced worker with low salary or not in terms of an employer, and it is still controversial. Of course, no one can deny that there are both positive and negative aspects of several opinions that arose to this issue. Although some people might claim that hiring inexperienced worker with lower salary is better, I believe that experienced workers with higher salary is much better for two reasons which will be explored in this essay.

     To begin with, the most crucial reason is that the effiency of working is high. To be more specific, since the experienced workers are already familiar to their works, employers do not need to worry about the time limitation. For example, if the inexperienced worker has to do some complex work at first, then he or she has to do some extra studying about the method to do such work or information about that. Hence, effiency rate of working will be lower than the case of experienced worker and it takes much more time to wait until they finish.

     In addition to the notion of efficency, there is a possibility that workers can do a demonstration about their salary. The reason is that they may not be satisfied with their salary or the environment of their workplace. My father's experience is a compelling illustration of this. In my father's company, demonstrations do occur frequently while the workers argue that the amount of salary is too low comparing to the amount of their work. However, my father, who is an employer, always says that he cannot agree with them because they do not even do their work well. Hence, as in this exemple, if an employer hire an inexperienced worker at a low salary, he or she does not consider about their ability and only complains about their salary. Therefore, no such problem will occur if an employer hire workers with high salary.

     Nevertheless, some people still argue that the company will have some economical problems if they hire workers at a high salary. However, I am against it and insist that more economical assistant will be needed if employer hires inexperienced workers. That is to say, to educate new workers to have some experience of complicated works, much more money will be needed to give such opportunities. In this respects, rather than worrying about economical problems, it is better to think as an investment for the future.

     In light of the above-mentioned reasons, I strongly believe that the advantages of hiring experienced worker at a high salary outweigh its disadvantages. Work effiency and so-called stability are important parts of companies to success. Therefore, it is much better to hire experts with higher amount of money. Opinions may vary from people to people, but what does not change is that this issue remains contentious, so it is worth thinking about it carefully at least once."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
626	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"  As the society develops, enormous companies appeared with various strategies. Some of the companies remain or innovate themselves, whether others suffer and eventually disappear. Therefore, strategy surely has significant effects on every company. While some of the people argues that the company should hire an experienced worker instead of an inexperienced one even at a high salary, companies must hire an inexperienced worker for various profits: low salaries, flexible company society, and brilliant ideas.
  First of all, inexperienced workers with a lower salary helps the company to try other strategies. Lower salary brings higher margins of the company, and the increased margin can be used for other developments; for example, upgrading tools and starting a new project might be possible. Especially, for start-up companies with insufficient money, lower salary is needed indeed.
  Besides of the profit related to margin, hiring inexperienced workers cultures a flexible society in the company. Experienced workers are likely to argue that their thoughts are always right, irritating other workers and creating a declined relationships. On the other hand, inexperienced ones are humble, and try to understand each other with empathy. Thus, inexperienced workers construct a friendly and flexible society.
  Even though knowing these profits of hiring inexperience workers, some people still insist that companies have to hire experienced workers, because they are 'professionals.' However, 'professionals' cannot solve the problem or meet requirements these days. The society is changing fast nowadays, and it requires new and fresh ideas. Inexperienced workers are just for the case. They are open-minded, and brings enormous innovative ideas, which can drive the company to a success.
  In conclusion, lower salary, humbleness, and innovative ideas are significant reasons for hiring inexperienced workers. They are working for enormous companies with their brilliant characteristics, driving a new wave on the entire globe. It may be interesting to see the change of companies' choice on hiring employees, with amazing successes of them by inexperienced workers."	4	4	4	12

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"I prefer doing what I am already good at for three reasons.
First, I have tendancy to focus on one sepecific genre or content. For example, I usually play video games of specific genre with my laptop when I have free time. I have played FPS game, which stands for First Pirson Shooting game, since when I wan middle school student and I'm still big fan of FPS. Also, I like listening one specific music over and over. I make playlist contains only one music, and I repeat the playlist for several hours.
Second, I like having feeling that I'm good at doing something. I enjoy concentrating on one specific thing, and it becomes easier when I'm good at the thing. For instance, I like playing FPS game because I can play FPS game well than other games, and it feels so good to be MVP or outstanding player in the game. 
Finally, my interests are related to each other and it makes me focus on specific topic. As I said, I like playing FPS game, but also I'm interested on guns and other military weapons. Even my favorite historical topic is WW1 ,WW2 and the Cold War. When I have free time, I play FPS game, but also watch historical video content about weapons and war history. Beacuse having interest about weapons and war makes me like playing FPS game, FPS is my favorite genre.
So far I explained why I like doing what I am good at. First, I like enjoying one certain content such as FPS game or music I like. Second, I enjoy having feeling that I'm skilled at something. Lastly, my hobbies are related to each other and it makes me be interested in certain topics."	3	3.5	3.5	10

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"I prefer to try new things and take risks rather than to do only what I already do well. There are three reason why I find new ways. 
  Fisrt, what we already do well sometimes has some problem. Old things are still good in some  ways such as tradition korean house. It needs large amout of ground, but only 1 family can live in it. Nowdays, Korea need lots of house in narrow place, so we ususally live in apartment. Likewise, if the original way has some problem, low efficiency, or it takes more time, it has to revise or we have to find more good and effective ways. 
  Second, finding my own new ways is challenging. Just doing only what I already do well is easy and safe because I can just follow the original ways. But, it is like a robot, not human being. It is not mean that original ways are not good and ONLY new ways are good. If we try to find new ways with some risks, we can imporve ourselves. Finding new ways is not always success. However, if we successfully find new ways, our life will be improved. Thus, we need to take some risks to find new ways. 
  Third, finding new things can grow our creativity. God dose not tell us something new. While finding new things, we continuously think and think how to develope and what to change. These thinking process will grow our creativity. Also, trying to find new things also can help. 
  For these three reasons, I prefer to find something new ways and take risks."	3	3	3	9

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"Trying something new is really important. In my case, I like to try new things and take risks if I failed. We have to improve ourselves to make our life and world better. When we want to develop or improve something, we should try new things because we can't improve anything if we do what we already do well. In this essay, I will explain why I think like this.

    First, if we do only what we are good at, we can't improve ourselves about some bad abilities that we have. For example, if someone want to improve his swimming ability, but if he always swim with only one method, he couldn't improve himself. He should try many other methods if he really want to improve his swimming ability. Of course there can be some accident if he try new swimming method, but when he overcome it, he will be a better swimmer. This is not only for swimming. Other abilities are similar too.

    Second, it would be exciting if we try new things that we haven't experienced before. In my case, I really like to try some new activities that I never tried before. Some activities might not suit for me, but I believe that there are more amount of activities that can satisfy me. Also, if I only enjoy what I tried before, my life would be boring. So I like to try new activity that I haven't tried before.  

    Last reason why I think like this is if people don't try new things, world couldn't be developed. Every inventions that made our life comfortable is invented because someone tried something new. For the future, I think it is important to try new things to make new inventions that can make people's life comfortable. We can't invent anything without new trial. 

    To sum up, I explained three reasons that why I think it is important to try new things that we haven't tried before. It is exciting and helpful to ourselves and world. If you are afraid to try something new because of risks, how about change your mind and try it? It would be great!"	3	3.5	3	9.5

They do not try new things and try just maintain their circumstances. But I prefer to try new things even if there are some risks. There are a few reasons to support my opinion.

First, to try new things is very interesting. All people cannot know what happen in the future, even a few seconds later. And all people have limited time to do something. So it is important to try new things in our own life. People can do only what they do well. However, what they do well is not same with what they want to do. As I mentioned, people has limited time but they want to do what they want. It is essential to try new thing. It must be some risks to try new things. But it is more valuable than do only what they already do well. I'd like to try new things with risks.

Seconds, we have to learn new things always. All people have their own talent and what they already do well. However, the environments and society change so people have to learn new skills or try new things to adapt the environments. For example, labors in 20th, they lost their jobs because of the appearance of conveyor belts. So they have to learn and try new things that conveyor belts can't do.
There are many example such as AI, robots, etc. We have to develop and learn new things to make sense and to prevent to lost our jobs. 

In conclusion, to try new things is interesting, people have limited time. And people have to learn new thing to adapt changing society. I prefer to try new things even if there are risks for this reasons. I hope people try to do new things."	3	3	3	9

There are few reasons which are related to my personality.
First, I am a very positive person. Therefore, I am not afraid to make mistakes and to be failed.
Second, I can learn new knowledge much faster than average people. I have been studied by myself without Hagwon(academy) since I was a middle-school student. This helped me a lot to learn new knowledge fast and be adapted to a different situation. The belief that I am good at learning new things, makes me seek new things.
Third, I am an impatient person. I don't like to wait for something and waste my time. ""Nothing special happens in my life"" feels same as waiting for something. So I need some special things to happen in my life.
Fourth, there is famous saying, YOLO(You Only Live Once). Since I have a finite time to be exist in this world, I will do, will feel, will achieve as much as I can.
Lastly, with those reasons, I tried to find new and challenging things in my life. During these challenges, I experienced success. Just like positive feedback, happiness from these success experiences leads me to challenge more, harder, larger projects, repeatedly.
Explorers, astronauts sometimes feel tired, want to go sweet home and take a rest. So do I. I often feel tired at the end of the project. But it's only for a moment. As explorers do, I will find a new shining star to start my special journey."	2	2	2.5	6.5

First of all, the mind to do something derives from one's perference. Doing something that I've already used to is obviously more comfortable in physical and mental aspects.
Second, Working with something new is thrilling, but not guaranteeing continueous growth. For example, Let's suppose you have to learn a language which is very unfamiliar. At first, you would say that it's rather entertaining when you learn about basic grammar and words. But then, you realize that at intermediate state, you start to feel less entertaining while learning, because the progress is becoming slower. And if you couldn't bear with this 'intermediate plateau', the whole process will cease, without meaningful achievement. With this example, we can see that doing something new requires sophisticated schemes not to lost the goal; it cannot be done only with one's eager.
In conclusion, I would like to do things familiar because they are pretty doable with less stress, and doing something that is not used to is too difficult to start only with passion."	1.5	1.5	1.5	4.5

We choose menu of lunch, method to go to subway station and using our free time. In that case, there are two type of people who make a decision. First type is people who choose way which they already experienced or do well. Another type is people who choose way which they do not experienced. In my case, I think I prefer to try new things and take risks. And there are some reasons.
  First, I like to meet new type of experience. Although result of my choice is not good, I think it is a new experience. I can make better choices later because of this result. For example, one of the my hobby is drink and taste. I like to taste wine, wisky and cock-tail. When I go to bar to drink, my first order is new type of wine or wisky. They are not cheap. But I pay and drink them to experience new taste and smell. Because of this effort, I can make my own taste style and I can recommend wine and cock-tail to my friend. If I drink only safety and already drunk one, I can't make my own style.
 Second, I fell less happy when I choose them again. I often choose my meal menu which I have eaten before. Because there are friend with me and I can't do adventure. Although that meal makes me happy but it is less happier than first time. I use money or other cost to decide. When I choose already one, it is safe but it is not fresh and shocking. My life is not forever, and I want to experience various things. But my cost and life have limits. So I choose new experience to meet new situation.
 Finally, I can't find best way, if I choose already do well. There are many way to solve problem and there are also exist best way. If we use only one way, we can't make sure that this is best and most efficient way. For me, making decision is the time that I find best way. If I eat one menu in restaurant which it is good and I eat it every day, I can't eat very very good food. Although there are some risk until find very very good meal, I can feel happy when I eat very very good meal.
 Therefore, there are some risk that to try new things, but there are gift which is bigger than risk. So I think I prefer to try new things.  "	2.5	3	2.5	8

Two of them are continuing to take advantage of their strengths and challenging new ones.  You can achieve success by continuing to develop what you are already doing well, but there is a limit to that success. However, there is no upper or lower limit on the new one. These are the advantages and disadvantages of new things. That's why many people are afraid of the risks of trying new things and failing. Doing something new is one of the ways to improve yourself, but it is not easy to abandon the current stability of doing what you are good at. I also want to do what I'm doing well without taking risks because of this fear.

     Generally, people who have less are not at a high level of damage. Like ""there's nowhere else to be sank more"", they can try many things and choose one that suits you better. Also, they can take risks without hesitation because they are desperate for success. But people who have relatively large and are satisfied with their current lives use more energy to maintain their current lives.

     For example, although I am still 20 years old and have a lot of days to live, my parents told me as if a single failure would soon lead to the rise and fall of life. Even if don't trying something new will not make it more successful, they do not tolerate taking on that risk.

   Throughout the history of human beings, consequences have been the criteria for behaviors. Some people in modern society disagree about this situation, arguing that processes are as important as the results. I partly agree with their idea, but I still think doing what I can do well is better than trying new things.
   First of all, doing what we already do well doesn't require additional resources. If one tries to do something different from what he or she has done before, it would take much time to adjust, money to study, and efforts to try. If the new one's worth exceeds the sum of all resources it took, it won't be a matter. However, finding the new areas that can result positive net effect is not an easy work. Considering all the efforts, staying where we are is often a better choice.
   Second, considering the whole society, specialization yields great efficiency. Our society has taken advantage of specialization. During the Industrial Revolution, mankind learned the greatness of specialization, and the spirit of it has continued to this day. Every people with jobs is playing roles in his or her own field, and by adjusting to their job they achieved higher efficiency. In this factory-like society, trying new things with risks can be regarded as a machine fault. I do not like to describe the society as a factory, but the importance of specialization is as serious.
   In summary, I prefer doing what I already do well because it is more economical and effective. For sure, challenging our limitations is essential to make a better world. However, I think the challengers should be only a few of us. The others can help them by doing what they do well so that the society would not collapse by the unexpected changes."	3.5	3.5	4	11

So, I didn't really participated in various activities and clubs in KAIST and just staying in library and read books or playing soccer  what I have spent most of my free time. But about 3 months ago I started having  a deep relationship with my current girlfriend. Her character is right opposite to me. In fact, my MBTI is INFP and hers is ESTJ. Also, she lives in Canada and I live in Daejeon. Whatever, during last three months I had no choice but to try new things everyday cause she is a person to try new things and take risks. And I was surprised since it was quite different from what I've been thinking of. Then I realized that majorly for two reasons I became a person like to do only what I already do and know well. Firstly, there were not so much risks as I thought before decide to do something. I thought that try new things might waste my time. So I most did what I used to do, but I realized after doing things I never did such as taking  photos, traveling new cities without preparing, trying new style clothes and doing long-distance relationship because I thought there would be so many uncertainties and danger so I didn't think that I could do and It would be wasting my time. However,  uncertainties and danger were not that hard and we could handle it if I have will to do and actually not doing anything and just  sit and thinking was the thing that waste my time. Secondly, I learned during last three months that there are so many things outside the book and books only itself is not enough to understand book. After my girlfriend has gone to Canada two weeks ago, a poet I learned in high school popped in my head which is 'I wish I could cut one moment with her and sleep with it every night.'. I think its literature in age Joseon. And I don't think I felt my emotion boiling inside my heart as now when I learned this first time in high school. After all, I wanted to understand and extend the boundary of knowing about world and myself and I thought just sit and reading books was best way to do so. But after I spend 3 months with a person who understands the world and herself in different way, I realized that I was too short sighted and feared. Thanks for her who let me know how to and why should I trying new things and taking risks."	0.5	1.5	2	4

I like it because there are three advantages of challenging.

First, I can find my dream when I try new things. What someone does well and what he likes is different from person to person. Some people have great talent in science or technology, while some people are good at music or art. Some people might be good at all of them. However, most people are educated in very similar ways these days. They go to the same school and take the same class. Consequently, it is likely that people do not know what they like or do well. In other words, what you think you are good at may not be what you do best. I think it is essential to try new things to find my dream.

Next, I can do new things well by practicing. One is never able to do something skillfully from the beginning. It is important to practice when I want to do something well. To practice something, you should start something. In other words, you can turn 'new things' into 'what you do well'. For example, I started to play guitar last year. It was difficult but I practiced hard. Finally I can play many songs with guitar now, and I got confidence. I believe challenging can make me better person. 

Finally, I can do what I already do well much better when I try new things. I believe every studies are connected each other. When you learn something new, then you can get better understandings on what you have already learned. For example, if you learn physics, you can understand mathematics better.

For these reasons, I insist trying new things is better than doing only what you already do well."	3	3.5	3.5	10

Some of tasks are easy to do, and some of the tasks are not easy to do. In other words, there are the tasks that I could already do well, but there are also tacks that I am not used to do it. Usually, I can not chose the tasks I like. However, if I can chose the task I have to do, I prefer to do what I already do well.
 First reason why I prefer to do what I already do well is because I feel happy when I do the tasks. As everyone knows, our time is limited. Therefore, there is not enough time to do everything in our life. Hence, it is clever chose that we have to do what we can feel happy when we do it in our limited time. For me, I had to make decision between physics and mathematics that what subject I would study when I was in high schools. I wished I could study both, but 3 years high school is not enough time to master two subjects. Therefore, I choose math because I feel more happy when I study mathematics.
  Some people said, life would be too monotonic if we do only we already can do well, but that is not true. If we do steady something that we already are used to, then the new things always comes to us. For example, in mathematics, we learn calculus when we are freshmen, and almost every freshmen get used to the calculus, and they might feel boring in calculus. However, if we study the calculus more deeply and steady, we can recognized that there are new things about calculus such as PDE (partial differential equation) or CA (complex analysis). Therefore, study only about calculus never be monotonic. Every time we think its boring, new things always comes appear.
 To sum up, I prefer to do what I like to do and already do well because it makes me more happy, and it never get boring. As I mentioned, our life is so limited, there is no sufficient time to do something that is risky. I hope that everyone can find what they truly like to do and can do very well, and finally enjoy their happy life."	3	2.5	3	8.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"Between doing only what they already do well and trying new things with risks, I prefer trying new things. There are two reasons.

First, by trying new thing, we can develop ourselves. In the case of football player, who tries the bulk-up to break the defense in the many cases with the risk 
 of the speed. and if he overcome the risk, he will be the better player than who just doing same thing which he do well.

Second, In the process which trying something what we do not well, we can know the problems which we have. if we just do same things, we can not get the problems, and we can not overcome them. 

But we can not choice the trying new things which have a risk. there are many aspects about the positive effect and negative effect.
so we should consider the all effects of the choice.
and if the bad aspect is small, I will said "" The risk is small enough to overcome, I'll try the new things"""	1.5	1.5	1.5	4.5

There are people who want to do what they do well. On the other hand, there are people who want to try a new behavior. I think the reason why a person's behavior is divided into two seems to be according to the situation where the person is placed. In my case, I prefer to do something new because I am in a position to learn something new as a student. There are three reasons. 
 First, I try a new things to self-improvement through various experiences. I think that getting a lots of experiences is important on life. These make our life meaningful. Experience give our chance to improve ourselves.  
 Second, I am young so I have less loss for failures and little fear of failure. The main reason why people don't try a new thing is they are worrying about loss due to failures. But, I am young so that less worry about failure relatively. 
 Third, I got interests from something new. And that interests make me stimulate on will of life.  
 In conclusion, I like to try a new thing rather than doing already done before. New things are improve myself and fill my interest."	1.5	2	2	5.5

It makes me more advanced and just doing same thing makes me bored.

First of all, I can grow up with trying new things. Trying new things and take risks can offer a chance to learn new skills or meeting lots of people. As I entered KAIST, I started to design some card news, goods and books in undergraduate association. It was my first try to using Adobe Illustrator, but friends and seniors teaching me well. Today, I am teaching how to design and how to use photoshop to other freshman. If I didn't try to learn design, then I couldn't to be able to design something.

Moreover, to do only what I already do well is so boring. We never enjoy to write same sentences 100 times. According to a research, human's brain activated when learn or do new things. It means doing only we already do well cannot activate our brain.

 I sometimes afraid of taking risks but it make me to grow up. For those reason, I am trying a lots of thins in university and will try new things."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

  When I do something, I usually think the worst consequence before doing something. 
Then I get scared easily. Trying new things and taking risks have more possibility to fail or make catastrophic situation than doing what I already do well. So, I prefer to do what I feel comfortable. 
   There is an advantage for doing things that I get used to. For my case, I started playing the piano and doing Taekwondo from my age 6. Many of my friends started with me, but they stopped within 4 or 5 years. I remember they wanted to start new things like studying arts, playing soccer, playing other musical instruments. I have kept playing and doing these things by now. I can play better than many of other people and protect my body from someone now. I am proud of it and I think the power that keeps to do something for a long period can be the advantage of my preference. 
   By the way, my father always said to me that 'the person who can do many thing but cannot do very well is better than the person who can do only one thing but can do very well.' I did not understand at that time, but I recognize it now. When I go to the bigger society, I felt that the experiences of many different kinds of things are very important to get along with people. Also, these days many people emphasize challenge, taking risks and try new things. I totally agree with it. Because, I am the student of KAIST who is the future of the science technology of my country. For engineer or scientist, attitude that does not scared with try to do new thing is very important. So, I make effort to change myself. 
   To sum up, I prefer to do only what I already do well. Because, I have more anxiety to do new things than others, and this can improve my special ability by focusing specific things for a long period. But I realized challenging new things is valuable and it is not that very dangerous. So, I am changing now. "	2	1.5	2	5.5

I will introduce some reasons why I prefer to try new things. 
First, trying new things can be my own various experience. I cherish various experiences. It does not mean that I do something as it was in the past. What I really cherish is the experience that can be the nutrition for my future. I think various experience can be helpful to raise adapting ability when I face to unexpected things. It doesn't matter that I success or fail. Challenging to the new thing just be my experience and confidence. By trying new things, I can make many experiences that can be helpful my life.
Second, trying new things is joyful for me. I think just doing what I already do in the past can give any enjoy to my life. The life that just doing repeated things would be very boring. I want to try new things to feel delight that comes from the freshness. In my case, the thing that I try new things also bring me happy thrill and it could be the motivation to power me. 
To sum up, I prefer to try new things because I can get various experiences and I can motive for my life. Although doing only what we already do well can be useful when I need to do something well, If we don't try anything new, we cannot any experience.

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"I prefer try new things and take risks than doing only what I already do well. There are 3 reasons that corrobotare with my opinion.

Fisrt, we can find other pleasure when we try to try new things and take risks. For example, in my case, I applyed for the KAIST school band last semester for guitar session but I could only get my position as bass guitar session due to my  lack guitar-playing ability. When I got call about this postion changing, I hesitated like ""Could I play bass guitar well?""and ""What I should do if bass guitar session is too boring to continue my band life."". However, I decided to join the band for bass guitar session. It was hard for me to playing the bass guitar at first time but it was funny and I feel happiness when I grab the bass guitar fourtunately. So it is one of my favortie hobby these days.

Futhermore, we can get many opporunity to meet other people. Usually, when we start doing something new, we meet many other people naturally. To elaborate with this, in my case, I started part-time job at department store lately. Before I started this part-time job, I have been always along with only KAIST students. However, when I started this job, I could meet many other people from non-KAIST, such as labors of department store. I could extend my thinking from talking with them since they have very different life and experienc with KAIST students. Thus, I am looking forward to weekend which is my working day.

Lastly, we can make success from try new things and taking risks. There is a famous lesson, ""No pain, No gain"". We can apply it to this topic, too. More specific, trying new things can be kind of stress or pain for people. However, we already know that attitude of trying newthings always have changed the world such as Edison's invention or many Nobel prizer's.  Also, I could come KAIST because I have been tried to study new feilds of science and mathemathics whcih were strange, hard, and I had not studied before when I was young. 

To sum up with my opinion, I prefer try new things and take risks than doing only what I already do well because we can find other pleasure, get many opportunity to mee other people and make success."	2.5	3	2.5	8

I prefer to try new things and take risk. First, something new is fresh to me and usually very different from original one. So, I can experience new things and get a more good insight. People who have many experiences can adapt with new situation. They can solve new problems in new situations better than people who do only what they know. To try something new can improve my insight and adaptability. Second, when I challenge something new and get a good result, I feel more achievement than when I do what I already do. This is because new thing is usually more difficult and unfamiliar to me. Trying everything and different methods in the new situation is more painful but we can get more achievements. Finally, something new is better than original one. The world evolves and makes something new regardless of you. They make something new because original one has some problems. If you don't accept something new, you will fall behind others. In conclusion, I want to try new things and get a good insight, more achievements, and good products.

  There are many things that we can do in the world, and we get many chances to try them during our life. At that moment, some people try new things, and some people avoid that chances. Whether it is good to try new things or not is controversial. 
  For the three reasons below, I prefer to try new things than do only what I already do well.

  First of all, it is not funny to do something that I have already done. Of course, repeating is very helpful to improve my skills, but I feel more interested when I try new things. I naturally don't like to do something boring, so I prefer to try new things even though there are some risks. 

  Secondly, I feel a sense of accomplishment when I do something new well. All new things are hard at first, but so I can get many rewards when I achieve it. I really like that feeling, so I want to try something new.

  Lastly, I do not want to be a person who can do only one thing. Of course, it is so good to do one thing really well. However, I think it would be boring if I have to do only one thing during my life. 

  In conclusion, I prefer to try new things because it is funny, I can feel a sense of accomplishment, and I want to do many things well. It is your choice to try new things or not, and anyone blames you if you avoid the chance to try new thing. However, I hope you remind that time past does not come back."	2.5	3.5	2.5	8.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"Challenge is one of the most important concept explaining history of developing humanity. There were a lot of people taking risks to get honor, wealth, new knowledge during human era. However, nowadays happiness of individual is getting more and more important due to the change of lifestyle, so many people say that we can live a better life by doing only what we already do well. Despite of this debateful topic, I strongly prefer to try new things and take risks. Two columns, experience and amusement will support my idea.
 We can accumulate various experience when we try new things. We face new people, new place and new task when we attempt new things we didn't do before. Thanks to our brain is trained to memorize things we never met, we can get more knowledges and experiences through various challenges. Broadened experience leads to see the world more widely, which is very important living this global era. For example, I know a student who just study at home and another student having a lot of experiences such as entering contests and volunteering. The later student become a CEO of a company due to his various experiences, however the former student is having a hard time having a job because he doesn't have wide eyesight.
 Also, we feel joy when we challenge new things we didn't ever tried. If we only do restricted tasks, then we will feel bored though the task is what we do well. However, if we try fresh activities out of daily routine, then our brain will be stimulated and make dopamine, so that we will be amused. Also, taking risk is very thrilling, so we will be more happier when we succeed our challenges. When I study all day, though I am good at study, I get bored when I do same thing long time. However when I go out and do something else like climbing mountains, then I feel fresh and happy.
 Some might say we can be relaxed and be cozy when we get inside of our 'routine bubble'. However, as I stated, I strongly argue that we have to pop the bubble and broaden our experience and feel fresh joy rather than boring coziness."	3	2.5	2.5	8

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"There are many argument that it is good to do easy work or not. Some people think that doing only what they already do well is good because it doesn't require any effort. On the otherhand, Many people believe it is great to do something risky because they can get some worthy experiment. Although there are many benefits when we do easy things,   I think it has more good affect to me to do something unfamiliar.

 First and most important reason for it is that we can not do what we have done everytime. When we go to high school, everything we have to learn is alway newthings. Also at universty, we have to learn more deep theory and have to do some unfamiliar things. We just have to adapt to something new everytime, everywhere. 

 By doing some new things, we can experience many things that we haven't had yet. For example, I was afraid to do some research program because I haven't done it before. But I tried to work hard and I could learn many research skills such as manual of reading cylinders and skills of writing reports. Also, by doing some chemistry research project, I could make a decision to go to science highschool. If I had not done some experiment when I was young, I couldn't have gone to this university, KAIST. 

 As we get more experience of new works, we will have more confidence of trying. This ""trying"" can change someone's life. So, I recommend my friend to do something new. I want to say people who worry about 
 trying ;  ""Don't hesitate to do something unfamiliar. It can change your life."""	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
649	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"I prefer to try new things and take risks rather than to do only what I already do well for these reasons. 

 First, it's very beneficial in many ways. This is because I can learn many different things while doing new things. For example I can learn diligence and responsibility. So I can become more mature and independent. I'm not good at physics. But when I chose science in high school, I chose physics on purpose. By choosing subjects that I'm not good at, it was more difficult and took longer than other subjects. But I was able to learn the importance of diligence by taking responsibility for the choices I made and working hard to get good grades. 

 Second, It helps me to relieve stress. Since I'm a student, I get stressed out from a lot of studying. So I need time to refresh myself, recharge energy, and relieve stress. So while doing new things, I can get away from my daily routine and refresh myself. For example, I'm not good at dancing. However, I have a habit of dancing when I get stressed while studying. This is because the joy that comes from the process of overcoming the dance that I'm not good at relieves stress from studying. So I like to do other hobbies that I'm good at, but I think I always dance when I am stressed out while studying.
 
 Third, It is helpful for my future career. This is because these days, things are getting more competitive and it's very difficult to get a job. In this situation, most companies prefer to hire people who have diverse experience. So the diverse experience will help me get more job opportunities after graduation. Also, even if it's little harder, by confronting and challenging, we can find what we're better at and out career path. Therefore, gaining carious experiences is not only advantages from the perspective of employment, but also advantages in that one can find a job that one really likes.

For these reasons it's better to try new things and take risks than doing only what they already do well."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"There is a famous quote, ""Working like a robot."" This is a common term that indicates people who repeat the same work without any changes and advancements. Many people stress out that a desire for advancements is the nature of the human being. I believe that challenging new areas is more preferable rather than being stuck on the thing they already do well for the following reasons: stress and education.

To begin with, it is desirable for me to discover and try new stuff since it allows me to overcome my stress. When people repeat the same actions again and again, they become dull. It means they cannot be stimulated and feel emotions by doing the work. This is a common phenomenon among all of the people, and also inevitable since nobody can enjoy infinitely repeating jobs. It may be critical and potentially lethal to the people since they can easily feel depression, one type of mental illness.

In contrast, challenging new stuff and escape from repeating routines is a cure for the depression. Trying new things is not an easy thing to do. It requires much focus and concentration, so it can easily stimulate people. They are exposed to their raw feelings during the work, and it can spark their passion, dulled by repeated and invariant actions. Therefore, it is advisable for me to try new things since it allows me to overcome my stress.

Furthermore, it is helpful for me to challenge new things since it educates me more. There is numerous amount of knowledge in the world. By challenging new areas, I can learn more and enhance my vision so I can understand the world more clearly, which is a key to success. Wide vision provides more criteria and tools for my further decision, ultimately gives me more options. For example, the people who only study laws can only become a lawyer, prosecutor or judge. However, if the person learns engineering in addition, they can become an engineer or engineering-specialized lawyer. The more people learn, the more chances they have. Therefore, it is preferable for me to learn and challenge various things because it educates me more.

In conclusion, stress and education are the reason I believe that try new things and take their risks is better than only do the mastered things. Some argue that it is stressful to try new things often, but we cannot ignore the value of vast knowledge. Therefore, taking risks and try new things are far better choices."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
651	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"During our life, we all have some chances such as chance to attend a lecture, and to enter a famous university. By taking the chance, we can change our life. By changing our life to a better way, we can achieve success. In the other hand, some people believe that success comes from careful planning but not from taking risks or chances. However, I strongly believe that we can success by taking risks or chances.
Firstly, we tend to overestimate risks than benefits from our actions, and think doing nothing is best choice. For example, even though risks from COVID 19 is bigger than risks from vaccination, people think doing nothing and being exposed to risks of COVID 19 is better. This is because people overestimate risks from their action than benefits from their action. If there are both risks and benefits come from some action, people just think about risks about the action, and they think doing nothing is better. This stops people from getting benefits by acting and makes people do nothing. By taking small risk, people can taste sweet fruit of challanging.
Secondly, everyone can make careful planning. If we think about normal people, definitely there will be more people that can make plans carefully than people that can take risks or chances. Thinking about successed people tells us that extraordinary people tend to make great achievement in their life, and live so called successful life. For instance, president Roh lived a very special life. He graduated comercial highschool, and he became president of Korea eventually. Regardless of his achievements as president of Korea, we all think he lived successful life. If we become extraordinary people by taking risks or chances, we can achieve great success in our life.
Lastly, every good things have bad things inside, and we call them risks.  For example, jogging is definitely good for our health, but is has risk of falling or car accident. There is nothing with only positive aspects. Everything in our life has both positive and negative aspects at the same time. So, if we try not to take any risks, there is nothing that we can do in our life. Taking risks is essential in our life, and we should know how to take risks.
To sum up, we should take chances or risks to success, and there are three reasons. We tend to overestimate risks from our action, we can become extraordinary people by taking risk, and everything in our life has risks and we have to take it. If we want to live successful life, we should know how to take risks with courage, which is the greatest aspect of human essense."	4	4	4	12

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"There are some debates that success in life comes from taking risks or chances or careful planning. Both ways can be a good choice, but I think that you need to make a plan for success. 
  First, why you should make a plan for success is you can expect what will be happened. You are expecting what will be happened means you are ready for the future. Although your plan would not be all same to real situation, overall flow is quite similar to your plan. Even if there are some mistakes in your plan or some accidents, you just revise the plan that match for recent situation and can overcome it. Also, while planning, you have to prepare for those kinds of accidents because planning for accidents is part of your plan, too. 
  Second, planning for success is more efficient than taking risks or chances. Just taking risks or chances is dangerous because you are taking risks or chances. Its results are good, then you will just keep trying taking risks. If the result is bad, it is hard to overcome because you just wait next chances. On the other hand, after you plan for success, you just follow you plan. If you meet some mistakes, your plan will show you what to do. 
  Despite ample evidence in support of the topic, some people think that taking risks or chances is better way than planning the future. It is hard to expect what will be happened, and you sometimes unreach or fail to small goal. However, your plan will show you what to do, where to go, what you want, and why you are trying. 
  For these reasons, planning for success is better way than taking risks or chances. By making a plan for success, you can be ready for future and you can get success efficiently. Just think that life is chess. If you are going to win chess, you have to find how to attack and defense. In same way, you have to make a plan how to approch to you goal and what you prepare. Then, how about making a plan for your career or goal."	4	4.5	4	12.5
653	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"In our life, there are many opportunities to take chance about new things. Since there are many things that disturb our comfortable life, a lot of idea and invention is coming to us every they. Most of invention and good idea were came from taking risks and try new things by someone's creative thinking and experiments with many failure. But some people would think it is bad to take risk while try new things so that they always careful when they plan something. In my case, I think it is better to take risks or chance to success in our life.

First, when we try something new, we can develop ourseleves. When try new things like study new topic or think different way with other people, we can learn more about that topic and creativity leads to new research of that topic. Every famous and helpful invention was came from many trials with failures. But if one of experimet become success, it is said to be successful experiment and everyone will recognize him as success people. In addition, creativity leads our world develop every day. If there are no people who have creative thinking about some topic, the world will be same everyday. Not all of our life is comfortable and there are many things that people want to improve, so thinking in new way is important to change our world and people's life more comfortable. So it would be better to take chance about new things whatever it has some risks. 

However, there might be some people who said taking risk is not good and we need to plan our lifes carefully because we can't sure that new chance would be success. But if anyone doesn't try new thing, we can't change anything that we want to change in our lifes. Only making careful plan can't make new invention or new research. Also, other people would not agree that someone's life as successful life if he live with only careful planning. Furthermore, it is not exciting life if we only do what is already researched. Doing new things can make us exciting whether they have some risk. It is really happy when we find success between many failures. So it is not good to have only careful plan in our lifes. 

To sum up, taking risks and new chances help us to success because they make people to make improvement in their lifes and change the world in better way with there creativity, and if people don't try new things, their life would be always same and it would be boring life. Of course there are some advantages in careful planning like there would be no failure and it is efficient to manage our time when we do something. But it might be better to take some chances with risks to improve ourselves and our life and also find new invention that make the world more comfortable."	4	4	4	12
654	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Many people want to success in their life. As you know, almost people have their own plan or vision to be successful life. We can divide into to type of people's faith. There are both success come from complete, careful planning, and success by taking risk or chances. Now I want to talk that the way to be successful life is taking risk or chances with two reasons.
 
 First, there are a lot of environmental factors in our life. I'm going to emphasize the factor that people can't manipulate such as money, study, health, family and friends. In our live, we can't anticipate to meet some events or people. For easy example, if someone was born in rich family, he has chance to get more experience than poor family. And if someone who make friends who are amazing people in the world, it can be a good chance to change his life. Chances are almost random, and we must take it in perfect timing.

Second, taking risk is essential part to be success. There is no person who success without risk. Even if me and my friend's cases, there are risk to go to collages for high school students. We may have to get other risk when we are on graduation class. For the other example, one of the best engineer in world, Steve Jobs, Mark Jukerburg, also got risk before they success. They take the risk and change the risk into the chances in there own way. Many people want to avoid the risk so that they try to find only stable way. However, it can't be the method to go success directly. You have to take risk, and conquer in your own way. 

 Some people say that ""how about we make plan our life with all factors? Isn't it the cause of the success?"" They believe that success results from careful planning. But, people cannot all factors that affect to life. Because there are some part that people cannot control such as nature, disaster. For example, no people who anticipate the  COVID 19 in2020, even the doctor in sociaty, analyst in economy. In fact, COVID 19 disrupted many people's plan for success. So, to plan to success is not perfect way.

 In conclusion, there are a few reasons. Chances are from environmental factor, so we have to take it. And taking risk is essential part to be success. finally,  people cannot all factors that affect to life likewise disaster. I want to say that the success in life comes from taking risks or chances."	3.5	4	4	11.5

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Obviously, every people in the world wish to live a successful life, since success in life is strictly related to happiness. Therefore, there exist thousands of mentors and teachers who tell us how to catch succeed in life. However, their saying is slightly different from each other. Some argue that taking risks or chances is the important portion, but some argue that careful planning is more important. In fact, none of them are wrong because both of them are a great way to catch succeed in life.

First, taking risks or chances is a compass that points way to success. Many of the CEO succeed in this way. In particular, Steve Jobs, who opened the era of the smartphone, decided to invent a device that has internet, iPod, and telephone ability while everyone considered it is impossible. Thus, he was different from others, because he is the only one who finds out the hidden breakthrough, realizes it is a great chance and takes a huge risk to create a company. Like the famous saying, someone who is available to catch a chance will succeed.

Secondly, careful planning is a strong shoe that can make us walk along the way to success. Knowing the things that I'm great at, knowing the things now I can do, and knowing how I will do my works after today is very important to succeed. Many of the famous restaurants proved their food is delicious while a long time of patience. While taking risks or chances is the way to catch a flying piece of success, planning is the way that leads to success naturally getting closer to me.

In summary, success in life does not come from only taking risks or chances or careful planning. If there exists only one way to succeed, this world might be very boring. There are so many ways to live a successful life, and each person should decide the method that most fits them."	4	3.5	4	11.5

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"A person's life is not meant to be determined. Becuase of the life's iternal uncertainty, there is to be a moment of choosing. someone would say that the choosing for taking risks or chances would make a person to be on successful track, but my opinion is different. I claim that success in life comes results from careful planning.
Before specifying the reasons of my statement, the meaning of one's success should be considered. For what situation that is reasonable to call one's life successful? Someone would say that the fame and money can say all about one's life, but I think it sufficient to call a life successful when a person keeps trying to fulfill his or her satisfaction. A life is just a process of trying to be satisfied, and the meaning of process comes from oneself, not from others. With this taking account, let's compare the proposed perspectives with respect to life. Taking risks or chances seem to be prone for a person to impose all the responsibilities for every consequences without explanable reasons. On the other hand, careful planning implies that the whole event is to be examined by oneself, and imposing responsabilities for the consequences is not thought to be unfair. In these situations, it is obvious that a person choosing to plan carefully will be satisfied with or at least accept for the results. Success is just a satisfaction, and even if one's life is filled with numerous fames and respect, it is hard to say the life successful when a person doesn't satisfied with it.
in addition, the reason of taking risks or chances cannot justify the current social mood. I think that taking risks or chances once had been reasonable claim but not for nowadays. The reason is that the expectation for oneself's life has changed. In the 80's or 90's, there was optimistic mood for overall society, and most of people are expecting the better future, which can be a powerful reason of enduring the pain comes from the life. The current mood is completely different. Nobody cannot explain the reasons of current social phenomenon, and it is unlikely to expect a defined future. With this current situation, claiming to endure the pain and expect for a better future seems obselete. Rather than that, living a life trying to be satisfied for now is more reasonable attitude dealing with life.
Life is a process seeking for satisfaction. If someone can be satisfied with taking risks or chances, his or her life is safe to be said successful, but if there's no reason to take risks or chances, that's not good attitude"	4	4	4	12

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"These days, many young people in Korea investigate to Bitcoin  or other virtual coins. They want to become rich. But many of them loose their money and make a lot of budget.  Bitcoin is the one of the most dangerous economic investigations in the world. It can bring a lot of money to us, but it also can bring a lot of risk to us. Bitcoin is a type of taking risks or chances. Such as bitcoin, many people choose taking risks or chances to success in life. But I think careful planning is better way to success than taking  risks or chances.
 First,  we can't make sure that chances are always our team. Although risky chances give us a lot of return, it can give us a lot of damage. One famous economist said that 'There are no free lunch in the world'. It means that every chance has their own price. If we choose taking risks or chances, we should pay risk for price of chances. However, careful planning can make sure that risk are not always our team. For example, when we investigate our budget, we choose various economic goods or stocks. It calls that 'making a budget profiling'. Budget profiling give us safe income for us. Although we can get smaller income than all in investigating, we can get smaller damage or get income when one section become low. These continuously income make our budget bigger and bigger, then small income also become bigger. So, careful planning give us hedge of dangerous.
 Second, careful planning gives us second chance. Although we planning carefully and perfectly, there are always existed an surprise event. For example, 9.11 is one of the most surprise event in the world. it couldn't predict and gave a lot of damage for economist. Taking risks or chance get a lot of damage because of these event. Planning give us way to how we do for these events and power for challenge second chance.
 Third, Panning gives us high probability. But also there are some people success by taking risks or chances not only many people become fail by this method. I think good method has high probability. Planning give us stability and high probability. For example, we can become rich by lotto. but it has very low probability for first prize. If we buy stocks and ETF instead of lotto, we can get income more usually than lotto. Planning gives us stability for success and future.
 Thus, although taking risks or chances can give us success in short time, there are a lot of risks and low probability. However planning give us stability and high probability. Some people can say to me, 'there are chance that has high probability and stability.'. Yes there are  good  chances for us. But I think find and choose good chance is provided by planning.

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"    Of all discussions that surface in contemporary society, the debate over whether people believe that careful planning is much important than taking risks or chances for their success in life remains controversial. Although some people argue that taking risks or chances gives more effect for success in life, I believe that careful planning is much important than taking risks or chances for their success in life for the following reasons.

     First, degree of success of each person is limited. Imagine that one person who born from rich parents and took a lot of support about his dream, and another one who born from poor home. These two people don't have the same chances to challenge for their success. If person has much money, he will be able to take risk again after experience failure. The second person, however, he can't. So, I think that taking risks is not good method to success for all human. Despite ample evidence in support of the argument in this essay, some people claim that importance of experience failure is much important than you think. However, I gave one more reason.

     Second, planning increases probability of success. Like ""Our life is C(Choice) between B(Birth) and D(Death)"", everything is accompanied choices. In this, if you take plan how to solve problem or situation, you can reach the best result. For instance, I saw many cases that one person who was a good job in one part, felt a great sense of loss after challenge to the other part. I think if he developed his strengths, he becomes the top of his own part.

     For the aforementioned reasons, I think that careful planning is much important than taking risks or chances for their success in life. Of course, there is good about risks with enough confidence and evidence. I pursue to choose the safest and least risky one to choose from."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

 Sometimes we see people who succeeded by taking different way with others. We also see people who succeeded by thoroughly planning their own ways. Therefore, many different views about the root of success in life are possible. Some argue that success comes from taking risks or chances; however, carefully planning our lives have greater possibility to make a success.
 First, planning helps prevent sudden changes. Life is not straightforward. It always has a chance to change due to the environment or behavior of ourselves. When this sudden error occurs, the method of taking risk cannot handle the negative effects from the error. However, by forecasting and planning our lives, people can notice the arrival of the change and can prepare for it. The risk of the unknown error would be lessened.
 Second, people can define themselves better by planning. Sometimes people do not know who themselves are, and what themselves can do well. Without knowing about myself, taking risks or chances is same as colliding to a wall. The process of carefully planning about the future helps finding who he or she really is. After defining and finding the advantage of myself, it would be much easier to decide what to do to succeed.
 Despite of such evidences in support of the benefits of planning, some people claim that planning is time-consuming and can delay the arrival of success. However, planning is more efficient than taking risks or chances in terms of expected time to succeed. It is irrefutable that taking risks sometimes bring success in a very near future. However, this quick success happens with a very low probability. In most cases, finding a proper way to succeed by trial and error takes more time than planning, since the probability to find the answer by trial and error is too low. Thus, if one wants to guarantee the success within his lifetime, planning will be the answer.
 In conclusion, carefully planning the way to success is a beneficial choice in terms of risk handling, definition of oneself, and time to succeed. This is not to say that taking risks and chances is always a bad choice. However, when a chance come to one's life, only prepared people can grab it. Therefore, to make a success, people should actively prepare and plan for their own lives, and should avoid to wait until success comes to them."	4	4	4	12

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances and thereby earn great fortune or fame. Others may believe that success results from careful planning. I think that there is no right or wrong answer for this debate, but  it depends on one's own value. Let's find out what value I put more weigh on and why this type of strategy on life can achieve or protect my value. 
 I agree with the idea that success in life comes from careful planning. The reason I agree with that is because I put much more value on my family and people around me, not great fortune or fame. For two years after graduating high school, I have thought deeply about 'what my life strategy should be?'. By comparing two sides of strategy mentioned above and looking back my nature, I concluded that I'm a risk averse person and I want to live a life that can protect or help my family and people around me. In order to live like that, I thought I should reduce risks by planning carefully for two reasons. 
 First, by planning carefully and reducing risks, I can protect my family or people around me. Since taking risks or chances implies that I might earn great fortune or fame, but it also implies that I might be loose everything. If I want to live alone, I might have taken risks and done adventures. But I want to marry my girlfriend and have children. In that circumstances, if I loose everything, it doesn't only hurt or damage me, but also my family.  I don't think I can bear it. 
 Second, taking risks or chances may be better strategy to succeed in short run, but in the long run, it may not always hold true. Life already has lots of risks around us waiting for chances to hurt us. Even though we try really hard to avoid those risks, we may not avoid every risks. So I think that taking the fact that human life is full of dangers and very fragile, it is more wiser strategy to avoid risks than looking for risks.  
 In conclusion, I retrospected on me and life then concluded that I'm risk averse person and it may not be always better strategy to success to take risks. Since I put more value on people around me and I believe that life is already full of risks. 
Thus, to live a life that I want to pursue, I would choose to plan carefully and avoid risks.  "	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
661	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Of all discussion that surface in contemporary society, the debate over where success in life comes from remains controversial. Although some people argue that success results from careful planning, success comes from taking risks.

First, success is the result of taking risks because the most things in the world are unpredictable. The world nowadays changes fast. Today, we can go anywhere on the Earth within a day. However, people decades ago never had thought that could happen. People ten years ago dreamed about video chat, and the dream comes true now. As the technology is being developed, the world changes faster and faster. In other words, there are few things that we can predict one's future. Only people who taking their risks at the past can make a success today. For example, Steve Jobs, who took his risks on IT devices, could be a CEO of Apple. Bill Gates, who took his chances on search engine, is a one of the most influencing person these days. 

Second, success is the consequence of taking chances because there are too much 'demand on safety'. All people loves safety; it is human's own characteristic. For example, in Korea, many people apply to be agents or teachers, which are considered as jobs that bring you money stably. But there are limited chances to be agents or teachers. That is, it is difficult to beat such many people. On the other hand, there are infinite chances to launch start-ups, because the Earth is huge enough. To that end, it is trivial to say 'high risk, high return' in sight of economics.

Despite ample evidence in support of the argument in this essay, some people claim that some celebrities have carefulness. However, most of them also have experience taking risks at least once. Lee Sun Hee, for instance, had taken her everything to be a singer. She is known as one of greatest and the most legendary singers in Korea. She is famous to have careful character. However, she had trouble when she decided to be a singer. It was because her family was poor. However, she did not give up and did her best to achieve her dream. She both worked hard and practice hard. She mentioned that she took her whole life. That is, it is essential to take one's chances to succeed in life after the long consideration.

For the aforementioned reasons, success in life results from taking risks. Therefore, you should not be afraid of taking risks if you want to make success in your life."	4	4	4	12

  There is no people who do not want success in their life. In other words, every people live for success. However, there are many point of view in how to get success in one's life. Some of people strongly believe that success results from careful planning. However, we already have many experience that something is not work as plan. Hence, rather than the careful plan, I believe that success comes from taking risks or chances.
   The first reason why I believe that success comes from taking risks or chances is, because of the rarity of success. We can see significantly many people that work hard as they can, and take cares in making plan, but it is hard to see the people who are successes around us. It implies that, only few people who take their chance, or only few who take risk and overcomes the risk can take successful life.
   Moreover, chance or risk affect to our life more directly than careful planning. Unlike the careful planning, we can feel the effects of some chance of risk in our life. For example, assume that there is person A who earn 10000 won by working hard for 1 hours, and there is person B who earn the same money in the street. Then A and B earn same money, but B can feel more happiness by the 10000 won which earn by the chance or coincidence. Hence, the chance or risk affect to our life more directly, and more deeply. In other words, our life can be changed easier when the chance or risks comes than careful planning or working hard.
   Still, there are many argues that the success comes from careful planning. They often say that only some people who makes careful plan can get the chance and reach to successful life. However, we have to know that it is problem of probability. Because we can not control the probability, someone could take a chance and reach to success without careful planning or hard working, and someone could never take a chance although they makes careful plans and work hard as they can. Therefore, we have to concentrate to catch the chance when it comes to us rather than just waiting for chance with careful planning.
   To sum up, only some person who takes chance or risk can reach to successful life. These chance and risk is important because it affect to our life more than careful planning or hard working, and we must catch the chance when it comes to us. Moreover, since these risk and chance is comes to us with low probability, we have to concentrate to catch it, rather than waiting it to come. I hope that you can reach the successful live by taking the risk and chance in appropriate times."	3.5	3	3.5	10
663	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"  There are various problems in people's life. To solve the problems, there debates about  the problem with their opinion, and the most representative debate is over whether that success comes from taking risks or chances or success results from careful planning. 
Although some people argue that success in life comes from taking risks or chances, I think that success results from careful planning for the reasons.
  First, careful planning can make us effectively. When we do a project which takes long time, we can be tired because we don't know when the project will be done. However, If we make a careful planning, we can calculate the time to finish the project. The calculation about the finish-time can make us to think about the due, and thought about the due will make us to do the project more effectively.
  In addition, careful planning can make us to do a effective behavior in the sudden conditions.  When we meet the sudden condition without the plan, we can't decide what should we do in the certain condition. However, we can easily decide what should do if we make a plan by edit the plan to fit in the condition.
  Despite ample evidences are supporting the argument in this essay, some people claim that we can not take a great success without taking risk. However, we can not make the condition to take a risk for the success without the careful planning, and taking risks can make the failure as well as success.
  For the reasons above, I think that success results from careful planning by making ourselves to behave effective and flexible in the certain condition."	3.5	3.5	3	10
664	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"In the world there are various people who live in successful life.  Let's consider that people who are successful life mean that they possess a lots of money. If someone ask them how they became a rich, then they might answer that ""I got a good chance"" or ""I had a detail plan to become rich."" Both can be right.  Although some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances, I believe that success results from careful planning for the following reasons.
First, the reason why the success in life come with detail plan is  having more growth potential than chance with success. People who plan detail a lot about how to earn money possess successive plan to earn more money when success come true. However, people who become success in life from taking risks or chances like gamble, lottery do not know how to earn more money using their earned money. 
Second, the reason why the success in life come with detail plan is  having more recovery potential than chance with success. When people who become success in life from taking risks or chances got in trouble such as going bankrupt, they do not have recovery potential because there are no guarantee that chances come them one more time. However, people who become success with careful planning do their best job to recover due to their alternative plan when they got in trouble.
For the reasons stated above, it is more right that real success come to people thinking careful plan rather than taking risks or chances. People who success through chances may exist, but they have less growth potential, and recovery potential than people who plan carefully. So, It is important that start life planning to success as early as possible."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"All people want to live a successful life. However, a successful life does not come to everyone. For success, we have to make careful planning. I believe that planning is necessary to overcome risks, catch changes and get motivation. Also, successful people say that planning was necessary to their success.

First of all, risk and chance can come to all. Only prepared people can get a chance and overcome risks. Planning to develop one's ability helps to get an opportunity. For example, only planned and prepared people to speak English fluently can catch a chance to go abroad. Of course, some people says that a plan cannot prepare everything. But plan can be changed. There is no reason that we must have only one plan. We can make a second plan for a failure. It is one of the planning.

Additionally, planning gives us a motivation to work hard. Let's think about it when we study for a test. Students that make short and long-term plans do the best to complete their plans otherwise some students do not know what do they have to without plan. Although it is a tiny example, not a whole life, it is a very good example to show us importance of planning.

Finally, many successful people say that their major success factor was planning. One example is my uncle. He is rich and also has a good social status. According to him, he has plans about his major, university, and jobs. And he says planning is the most important factor to success. Although it is a special case, it is a case that is worth to referring.

For the above reason, planning is important for successful life. Plans make us prepare for a rick and catch a chance, encourage us to work and study hard, and help those who has already succeeded. I hope you make a good plan and live a successful life."	3.5	4	3.5	11
666	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"  Do you read the book about the people who did success in life such as mother Teresa, Yeona Kim or Jisung Park? I read a lot of stories about them from when I was young. Therefore, I realized that there is common point from their lives. The common point of people who had successful life is that they caught a big chance or overcame risks. Therefore, I agree with that successful life comes from taking risks or chances.
  The first reason of my opinion about successful life is life's uncertainty. Human lives about 80 to 100 years. In our lives, we cannot expect what will happen to us. Thus, careful planning does not make our lives successful. Careful planning is helpful for short term goal, is not helpful for long term goal like life plan. 
  There is story about the most famous soccer player of Korea, Jisung Park. Jisung Park had bad conditions for soccer player. He had flat feet, short height and he had no dribble skills like Lionel Messi. Someday, he faced the big chance. The chance is that he had a opportunity to play against the national soccer team for 2001 Sydney Olympics. Then, he got a chance. He scores in that game, and manager of the national soccer team picked him for 2002 World cup. As we know about him, he showed stunning performance in the world cup, then he went to the Manchester United which is one of the greatest soccer team in the world. The point that I want to emphasize is ability to catching the chance is very important. As Jisung Park did, some chance or some risk change our lives.
  Many founders of international company such as  Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Bill Gates took risks in their lives. In 1980s, computer and Internet is very unknown for everyone. However, they choose the way that anyone goes and made sensation to the world. The ability that taking risks is great for make life unique and successful although it is dangerous. 
  To sum up, I want to emphasize that our life is so long. To plan our whole life is not appropriate. When we live life for a long time, I believe at least one chance comes to us or at least thrilling risks comes to us. Get the chance, make your life successful. Take risks, change the world."	3.5	3	3	9.5

Just study and work hard forever? Maybe it is not the case. If someone want to success, he or she should take the risks. Let me introduce the reasons why taking the risks is how to success in life.
     Firstly, we can get bigger chance to success. The maxim said, ""High risk, high return."" This maxim means that we can make greater result when we take higher risks. For example of stocks investment, there is more higher increase rate in expensive price of stocks. Therefore, higher returns comes to people who challenges against the safety.
     Secondly, taking risks is helpful for later success. It is possible that we fail in something when we take a risk. However, it is not the game over in life. People have many chances. People can get lessons for the failure right now. Therefore, if people take risks, they can learn lessons. Moreover, they can success with prior lessons.
     Finally, it give us challenging spirits. If we have pose to take risks in everywhere, we would not afraid in any difficult things. People can feel confident. This confidence can let us do best in any work. Therefore, the efficiency of working would be increase. 
     To sum up, taking risks can make big success by receiving more chances to success, learning lessons for success, and getting confidence to do anythings. Taking risks is not rolling the random dice. It is not to want lucky jackpot. If we don't afraid failure and risks, we can success by constant study."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"It is hard to think that  all people agree to the same idea about where success comes from. However, my stance is adamant. I belive that success in life comes from taking risks or chances rather than careful planing.

  To start with,  the world is changing continuosly that can not be predicted easily and the speed of change becomes faster and faster.  For example, EECS(electronic engineering and computer science) is one of the most famous fields in nowadyas. However, just before 10 years, no one knew that EECS becomes hot so much. This was possible due to much faster development of AI rather than people's prediction, and sudden pandemic situation lately. Many plans that might be prepared carefully became meaningless. Thus, careful planning is not suitable for rapid-changeble world, while taking risks or changes are more suitlble for the world. 

  Moreover, the human history have been proved taking risks or chances had made significant success. For instance, Light Brothers, pioneers of the invention of airplane, are famous for never-ending challenge to make an airplane fly with risks of dead. They could made a greatful success in human history since they had taken risks rather than planning careful planning. 
This is why many nation's goverment have made policies about venture-enterpises to seek siginificant developments, too.
 
  Ultimately, to prove our ability, we need opportunity to show, not just only careful planning. Thus, we need to seek  taking risks or chances to get enough opportunitues. To be specific, opportunities can be preparing big test such as Law-school, or applying to the school that we want. 

  To sum up with, I claims that success in life comes form taking risks or changes due to above 3 reasons, rapid-changable world, human history, and opportunities to show our ability. We should develop ourselves by taking risks and changes."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
669	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Most of people want to success in life. Success is the most important thing to achieve, and it is not easy to most of people. Success in every project in our life leads to success in life. Some people may say that success comes from chances, and luck is the most important factor in success. However, I think success is the result of careful and sophisticated planning.
 First, success without careful planning is easy to fail later. Success with luck is that all factor of project are good state, and they are not made of you. Therefore, if one factor in project becomes wrong, it is not easy to fix the factor and make all factors good again. Then, several factors becomes wrong, and you don't know how to fix them, and the project would fail. However, if we know about all plans in the project, we can know what goes wrong immediately, and we can fix what goes wrong as soon as possible. Some people might say that success with careful plannig also cannot cover all factors in the project. However, it is much better that some main factors can be fixed if they go wrong than that we do not know what to repair.
 Second, people can repeat success with careful planning in the simillar situation. We will encounter simillar situations if we do project in the same subject. The factors that influence the simillar situation are same in the previous situation we success. As we experience the simillar situations again and again, we can accumulate the ways which are helpful to success in the project. Therefore, we can success easily in the next project and it leads to success in life.
 Lastly, we can share our work with our colleagues with careful planning. We cannot do the big project alone, so we need to collaborate with other people. However, if we do not know overall plans in the project, we cannot share our thoughts or plans with other people. It makes the success of the project slower, or it can be result in failure in the project. Sharing the same plans is important to collaborate in the same project. We can get help by other people easily when we explain where we need help.
 In conclusion, success with good plans can fix what goes wrong, repeat the success in similar situations, and share our work with our teammates. Although there is no perpect plan to success, we need to do our best to plan carefully and make good plan. Good plan and your efforts lead to success in your life."	3.5	3	3	9.5

In my opinion, I believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. There are several reasons in support of my idea. 
  First of all, success results come from taking risks or chances because if I do nothing, nothing would be happen. Assume that I plan carefully for success. Then I become to focus only on success, so I would delete something in my plan that can make problems for success. It means that I give up something before I do that. On the other hand, if I catch the chance with some risks, even if I fail, I will learn something from that results. Therefore, taking risks or chances can bring us good results.
  Moreover, I think I cannot succeed when I do something that others also do. It means trying something new is important to succeed. However, I believe that thinking the innovative ideas is hard with careful planning. Of course, someone can get a new idea from careful planning, but someone who tries more will be easier to think about something new. Hence, I believe that success from taking risks or chances. 
  Finally, risks also give us good lessons. Most of people avoid the chances because of the risks that the chances have. However, I can claim strongly that 
  In conclusion, I claim that it is true that success in life comes from taking risks or chances for three reasons. First, doing something is better than giving up before doing that. Second, I have to try something new to succeed. Third, risks also give us good lessons. These are reasons why I say taking risks and chances for success in life. If you want to succeed, do something before planning carefully."	3.5	4	3.5	11

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"In every important chances in people's life, generally there are two choices: to take a risk, or not. Usually, many people doesn't take unplanned risk and just live their ordinary life. Almost of students in Korea wants to be an public worker, so that they don't have to take risks during their lives. However I believe that success comes from unexpected situations, and I will state my thesis with two concepts, experience and meeting new people.
New challenges leads to abundant experiences, which leads to improve our work ability and insight, so that we can live successful life. If we repeat our daily routine and try nothing new, we get no new experiences. Nevertheless taking risks such as starting a new project or climbing high mountains, even though we fail to succeed, we learn why we have failed. Then we are able to restart a new challenge with a better condition. Repeating risky challenges until we achieve the goal, we feel proud of what we have done, which was very hard quest throughout our life, and also we can learn a lot of things through vast experiences during numbers of failure. For my example, there was a chance to enter badminton club at my high school. Although I was very bad at sports, I decided to take a risk and learn a new sports. While learning badminton, I hurt my knee, joints and arms. But, practicing again, my ability for badminton got and my health also got better. Also I became confident to join other sports club.
In addition to that, we can meet new people while we do new kind of tasks. After we decided to try risky challenges, we have to get into a totally different environment; different place and different people. While meeting and having conversations with them, we can indirectly experience new culture, new knowledge and new style of thinking. For example, I entered a robot championship at Dubai few years ago. In the contest place, I met friends from various countries. Making global friends, I was able to know culture of Italy, new technologies of India, and new lifestyles of Greece. After that experience, my perspective got broader, and with new knowledges, fresh insights merged from my mind. From that experiences, I could improve many parts of myself.
Some might say 'safe is the best', but as I stated, it is clear that many challenges and tries will change our life dramatically. I suggest for others to try new things they didn't done before, even if it is very small thing such as having a new hobby."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
672	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"  As society develops and people's desire for success increases, many issues have become controversial, one of which is whether success comes from taking risks or not. A majority of the population insists that success comes from countless challenges and courage. Nevertheless, some others strongly deride the above position. Because they have different backgrounds, each person has such a variety of views. With the two sides expounded, I believe that success in life comes through numerous adventures. There are several bases for why I agree with this perception and I want to delve into some of the most significant ones here.

 One of the most attractive points is that there are many cases in which the product which was released with creative thoughts becomes very popular. The person who first made the product and introduced it to the market have had great wealth and honor. To illustrate this, there are some very persuasive examples. Microsoft founder Bill Gates developed innovative software that has never existed before and was able to earn great number of money. In addition, Tesla founder Elon Musk, who tried to invest in new businesses such as Space X is also gaining more wealth and honor.

 Another crucial element why I believe the contention is that we can get accomplishment whenever the task succeeds and grow further based on this accomplishment. It can be given a concrete example. Challenging and succeeding in a new task evokes a tremendous accomplishment. In particular, we can get more self-confidence when we accomplish the task that has higher risk. 

 Some people examine this issue from another angle. They claim that following a well-organized plan is more likely to succeed. The arguments may sound appealing, but subsequent deliberation makes it clear that is not what it seems. If we just follow the plan, we can't learn the experiences of failure. Many people find a way to succeed in failure. For example, if you have failed an experiment, you can find a better way of research and learn about the right research principles in the process of analyzing why you have failed the experiment. When these experiences are accumulated, you will eventually become a great researcher. 

 In support of the abovementioned substantiations, I firmly hold the stand point that success come from carrying out numerous risky tasks. By trying something new, we can make innovative inventions and we can learn experience of failure which are nourished and create a path to success. There is a saying that success is the mother of failure. I hope that many people will do risky things and experience failure, and continue to challenge themselves for a better life."	3.5	4	3.5	11
673	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"There are so many people in the world. While there are some people who have succeeded enough to look up to everyone, there are many people who have not succeeded enough to live hard day by day. However, whether successful or not does not tell us that taking risks or chances or planning careful. And many people has diverse perspective on these. But I think those who are prepared are more likely to succeed for the following three reasons.

 First, 'challenge' is also a thing that only prepared person can do. Taking risks or chances eventually means 'challenge'. Taking risks may seems that do very big adventure, but it actually means challenge bravely. For example, think about stock. At stock, it is not a proper challenge to put 10 million won in stocks where unit prices are just rising in the stock market. A 'proper' challenge is to invest as much money as you plan after observing the stock in the long run by combining profit and loss rates, long-term ups and downs, and expert advice. Therefore, it is too drastic to be able to succeed simply by saying 'taking risks'. Taking risks and doing a proper ""challenge"" through what you have planned and implemented and numerous data obtained thereby is eventually the way to success.

 Second, Humble people succeed. It means humility of attitude, regardless of just material humility. And 'humble' means the things that wrote from now on. Opportunities come only to those who do. Opportunities come to everyone. However, only those who are prepared accept the opportunity that came to them as an ""opportunity."" Successful people are based on probabilistic careful planning. Of course, there are cases of success by taking risks or taking certain opportunities, but there is a common saying in autobiography, books, and books written by successful people. In other words, do your best on the spot, but if you have a chance, catch it. In addition, those who are prepared can wisely solve risks. Everyone is bound to face danger somehow. And those who wisely solve the risk and develop them succeed, and those who are swept away by danger fail. At this time, a thorough plan is needed to wisely solve the risk. All risks are not planned anyway. Since risks or difficulties arise in unexpected places, it is important to develop the power to wake up and overcome themselves when risks occur rather than preventing the risk situation itself. And the most important thing at that time is the plan. A person who has planned his or her work meticulously is likely to go through it well without being embarrassed in the event of a crisis. 

 Lastly in the end, true success is not about others, but about yourself. Of course, there is a standard of success that others say, but in the end, a 'happy life' is truly a ""successful"" life. Therefore, it is necessary to think about how you feel when you invest excessively at risk and when you plan and act carefully. Let's look at the case that succeeds first. Both investing at risk and carefully planning will be happy and proud to earn a lot of money or gain a high social status as a result. Then consider the opposite case, that is, the case of failure. If you take the risk, it is highly likely that you will not be able to rise again because failure is also your responsibility. However, if you plan and act carefully and fail, it will be sad, but failure will also be made into one of his numerous data, giving you the power to eventually happen again, and it is highly likely that it will not be a failed life for you to judge.

 To wrap up, there is a proverb which says ' Opportunities come to those who are ready'. In the end, accepting the opportunity that comes to everyone as a real opportunity, and turning it into an opportunity when danger comes, are all thoroughly planned and prepared people. The phrase ""successful by taking risks or chances"" is a word that eventually takes opportunities as 'real' opportunities and establishes after the processes of turning risks into opportunities. There is a reason why the probability of winning the lottery is low. It is not easy to succeed without any preparation like the lottery. Success comes only to those who faithfully prepare thoroughly and accumulate their skills by achieving their duties step by step."	4	4.5	4	12.5
674	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"There is a famous Korean saying, ""You should check the bridge before go over it."" This is a common saying that I have heard throughout my life from my grandfather. He wanted me to know that careful planning never betrays the man who planned it, and I agree with him. I believe that it is better to plan carefully rather than take a risk to achieve a successful results for the following reasons: stress and time.

To begin with, it is more advisable for people to make a detailed plan since it allows them to overcome their stress. One of the well known fact is that the people with less stress are more likely to choose better options. Since detailed plan reduced uncertainity of the future, it allows them to overcome their stress. For example, my friend Jake Park have a strict plan for his future academic careers. As a result, he rarely experiences stress. He tolds me that he can overcome his stressful days because he has a big plan for his life's ultimate goal: to be a successful researcher in mathematics. Conversely, if someone likes to take a risks and chances, perhaps they will constantly struggle with stress. Therefore, it is better for people to stay on the plan since it is therapeutic.

Furthermore, it is more preferable for people to sketch their future plans because it enables them to save their time. Many succeed people were able to success since they continuously saved their time. With the well scheduled plan, it makes people to save their time. To illustrate, when people have a number of tasks to do, they often feel confused because they cannot distinguish which one is more important thing than the others. However, if people have a plan, they can easily decide which tasks are more significant one for their future careers. In contrast, if someone just depend on immediate risks or chances, perhaps they might waste their time for unnesessary jobs. Therefore, it is more considerable for people to make a detailed plan since it helps them to save their time.

In conclusion, stress and time are the reason why it is better to plan carfully. Some might argue that there are numerous people who can succeed by taking these chances, but we cannot deny the value of the well-structured plan. Therefore, I believe that it is more advisable for people to make an elaborate plan rather than depending on unexpectable risks or chances."	4	4	4	12
675	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"People want to get a lot of money. But people use the many in different ways. Someone spend it immediately, and someone save it. I think save my money for some time in the future is better to enjoy my money when I earn it because of the two reasons. I need to prepare the future, I feel sad when my money in the bank decrease. 
 First, I try to save my money to prepare the future. Even if I can get a lot of money, I don't know what happen in the future. Maybe I could fire at the job or I could feel so tired and I need a rest. If I enjoy my money when I earn it, I will live a so hard life when I fired. Also I couldn't take a rest when I wanted it. Many things that I didn't expect can always happened. And I need money for marry, baby, old life in the future. If I get married and have a baby, I need more money than before. I need a house, car, more foods, and many other things. Saving money will really helpful for this things and old life.
 Next, I feel sad when my money in the bank decrease. Now I earn small moeny. But when my money in the bank dissapear, I feel sad and I get so many stress. When I imagine that I earn more  money and more money in the bank decrease, I think I can't get out of thinking of that money all day. 
 For these two reasons, preparing the future, I don't want stress because of the money lost, I think save my money for some time in the future is better to enjoy my money when I earn it. Of course I will spend my money for enjoying my life. But I will use it for saving more than enjoying. I want to live a comfortable life for every age."	2	2.5	2	6.5
676	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"When I was little I think it's trivial question. My opinion was to save my money is much better than to enjoy my money at the time I earn it. The reason why I thought like that is just usually the moment when we need to spare money and when we want to spare money is quiet different. I thought that saving money is the best. I like to observe my account growing more and more. But as time passes, my opinion changes a little bit different. Now I realize that purpose of money is spending.
I will briefly tell you about my experience about this problem. Last month, I worked at KAIST Munji Campus for preapring the science camp for lower income group students. After finishing the camp I can get a plenty of money(At least I think it's pretty big even though our teacher who construct and manage whole program said that it is just small money if I were a real worker not a tiny cute university student) and I saved it carefully in my account. Acutally I didn't have much interests about that money. I think saving it is just not that bad choice. During working at office, the teacher said that she will buy a scrumptious meal to me. We went to a restaurant where the cooks sell foods like steak and pasta. I choose a cream pasta and it's so delicious. While we were talking in the restaurant she told me a story about her instructor at her first workspace. The instructor often choose to eat so expensive and delicious food when the team goes out to have a meal together. And he said that ""If I cannot experience precious and expensive stuff-like food, I cannot treat my people well."" I reckoned about his saying so long. I always try to save my money but never think about where to use. That night, I bought clothes that I've wanted so far and ticket for Millie's library which offered book streaming service. Also I bought a present for my friends and boast like Malfoy with saying ""Your friend rich!"". And last I gave 50,000won to an organization helping children who parents are gone and 30,000won to other authority helping disabled boy and girls. I became more happy one even if my acoounts became a little bit hungry. Still I know that spending money without considering problem in future is stupid but synchronously I learned that Scruisie-Sorry acutally I don't know exact spelling- is certainly bad.
To summarize, I think that it is not important to determine when I spend my money. What really important is decision about not 'when' but 'where' to spend my money. And spending some money to boasting to friends or parents and helping other people can be more worth experience. But, people usually don't change well...so if I should choose ONE side, I still choose saving money is better to earn the time to find more worth space to spend money!"	2	2	3.5	7.5

"Money is one of the most important things in our lives. We can buy so many things with money, and it increases our life quality. It is pretty sure that it is good to have a lot of money. However, there is a controversy about how to use money. Some people say that we should enjoy the money we have. However, I think it is better to save money rather than enjoying all of them.

First, we cannot earn money for our whole lives. If we use the money right after we earn it, we cannot use money when we get old. Therefore, we should save some money for future life. 

Second, our lives are unpredictable. There could be some emergencies that need a lot of money. When we don't have any saved money, it is going to be really big trouble. We should always save money for unpredictable disasters.

Some could say that the reason why we earn money is to enjoy the money so we should enjoy the money we earned. It is true, but it is not the only reason why we earn money. We should not enjoy the whole money we have.

To sum up, we should save some money for the elder life and emergencies. You should keep it in mind and don't use your whole budget for your joy."	3	3	3	9

"  People are discussing about habbits associated with money, saving and spending. In my opinion, saving our money for some time in the future is the better way to use money wisely. There are two reasons of my opinion.
   First of all, we can use our money for accident things in the future. We don't know what will happen in the future. We may have car accident, or may go to the hospital accidently in the furture. If we use our all money-not saving, we can't pass that things easily. Secondly, there are many circumstances, which we should use our money. As we grow, we should spend our money for other people and ourselves. If our friends are going to marry, then we should give money to him/her to celebrate. If I want to marry with someone, I need a lot of money. If I need car to go somewhere, I need money. Therefore, we need to save our money for some time. 
   We need to save our money for our future. Spending our money for the short time can be dangerous. If doing so, we can't do something, which we really want to do in the future."	1.5	1.5	1.5	4.5

"  There are many kinds of lifestyles these days. There are people who are called FIRE, NEET, Boomerang, and so on. I think the reason for these diverse lifestyles is the difference in thoughts of money. I don't think which lifestyle is right or wrong but I have my opinion and I will write about it. I think it is better to save money when I earn it because of these several reasons.
   First, saved money makes me feel confident when I meet accidents. If I get hurt or make a problem, I need to go to the hospital or make some time to solve it. If I don't have enough money I can't do anything. So, saving money is an investment for an unpredictable future. For me, I got 
   Second, I can get much happiness by spending money when I really need it. Traveling to other countries or buying new electrical devices need a lot of money. If I spend money as immediately as I earn, I may get small happiness but I can't get much bigger happiness by traveling or purchasing products which I really needed. 
   Last, money can make money. If you save your money in a bank account, the bank will give you interest for your money. In different ways, you can buy stocks or real estate. The stocks and real estate may rise their value for a long time, and you can get profit by selling them. In 2020, many people earned money because the stock market was good due to COVID-19. 
   For these reasons, I think it is better to save money rather than enjoy it. As, I save money , I can easily solve unpreictable situations, make bigger happiness, and make more money. So, as I have saved money, I will save money."	3	3	3	9
680	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"This problem can't be solved by an one-sided way and it depends on a personality in my opinion. So, I suggest the general way in the standard of me. 
 Of course, saving money for future is important. However, I think that it is better to enjoy our money when we earn it. There are two reasons for this opinion.
 At first, money is just a tool to get happiness. Money can't become happiness itself. Some people could get satisfied with the possession of money, of course. But, fundamentally, we can get happiness with the use of money. So, we don't have to avoid using our money. 
 Secondly, excessive investment for future is actually not right. Such investment can make us unhappy in present. If you are not happy and you will be happy for some time in the future, then can you say that you have lived happily? I think you can't. 
 Actually, both two ways are needed for appropriate use of money. However, if we have to choose only one way, we probably choose the first way. Because that is the way not only to use the money but also to live happily."	1	2	2	5
681	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"I prefer that saving my money for the future. I am only 21 years old. It means that I have to live about 80 years normally. For 80 years in future, there will be lots of accidents and problems. In modern times, we can solve many problems with using money. So, we have to keep our money for prevent some accidents.

If I cannot use my money for my amusement, it might be unhappy. However, if I have some money kept before, I can feel comfortable because of the potential of money.

Some people say that we have to enjoy our life like YOLO because we can't know when we die. But I don't think so. If we don't save money, we can't go to hospital in critical moment. So, I think that only enjoying money is so risky.

Moreover, enjoying is only effect at that moment but saving can be permanent. We can buy a car or moving to a bigger house with saving money. Without saved money, the life will be dangerous. If I was 40 years old, I could have different mind about money but I am too young to spend all money. I have to reduce risk in my life with saving money.

People who don't want to save their money say that they can feel happy with spending money. Similarly, I can feel happy when I see the saved money. I can't say my way is the correct answer. But in my case, I don't like to make a risk so I want to save my money for my comfortable future. And then, I want to use saved money at the important moment."	2	2	2	6
682	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"Money is the most important thing in our world. Without any money, we can't do almost everything. Because of the importance of money, money management has also become a big issue these days. There are many money management strategies, such as saving, investing in stocks, and buy real estate. In this essay, I'll argue about why enjoying the earned money is better than saving it.

First, the value of the money gets lower. In the 1980s, we can buy a house in Seoul with less than 100 million won, but nowadays, at least a billion won is required. It's an example of price inflation. Price inflation always happens in our world because the government always makes new coins and bills, so the total amount of money gets increased always. That means the money in 2030 is more worthless than the same amount of money in 2021. So saving is inefficient.

Second, spending the earned money right away gives more impressions. If we spend saved money, we can't feel a big impression because saved money has no story or context. But when we spend earned money right away, we can feel accomplished because we usually remember how we earned this money. Even if we spend the same amount of money, we can feel more satisfaction with lately earned money than saved money. So enjoy our earned money has more value than saving the money. 

Third, spending money helps us make the right consumption habits. Consumption habits are very important because the purpose of earning money is to consume. If we buy things in a bad way, earning money gets almost meaningless. Then how to make the right consumption habits? The most significant factor is experience. With many experiences of buying something, we can face many situations. That helps us correct our habits. 

In conclusion, enjoying the earned money is better than saving it because the value of money gets lower over time, enjoying the earned money gives us more accomplishment and satisfaction than saving it, and spending money helps us make the right consumption habits. If you have some earned money in your bank book, how about spending that money rather than just saving it? There are many ways to spend money, such as buying some products and invest in stocks or coins."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
683	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"When we earn money, there are two ways to manage it. We can spend it, or we can save it. Nowadays, there is a trend that using money is more meaningful, such as YOLO. However, in my opinion, saving money is better than earning money. 
 Firstly, consumption-centered life can make us slaves of money. Paradoxically, to enjoy our life well, excessive enjoying money should be rejected. For instance, using credit card lead our purpose of life repaying the money.  
 Secondly, there is a lot of danger and instability in the future. To demonstrate, members of the family can ache or situation of a friend can be awfully bad.
 For these reasons, saving should take priority over spending. There are two types of people on these days. One is who gives interest to the bank, and the other is who receives interest by the bank. There is no freedom to a person who lives today."	1	1	1.5	3.5

 Nowadays, I have lots of thought about earning money and saving money and becoming rich. Even though someone said me to spend money and enjoy my life, I still tried to save money as possible as I can. I thought to save money for some time in the future is better than to enjoy my money. There are two reasons.

First, we have to consider our future. We can't predict our future correctly and anythings might be happen in the future. Your company might fire you even from the following month. So we can save money to prepare your future life well.

Second, we can made much more money from what you save. Nowadays, the house price is very high. If you buy house a few years ago, you can have benefits. Like this, you can invest in big company or something. And you can earn money without working.

   Second, I like spending lots of money at one time. Such as, buying computer, buying good(expensive) things and traveling. To do such things, I should make a spending plan and save money.
   Finally, If you have lots of money by saving, you can make more money with it. You can make money by buying stock or making doposit. If you have lots of money, it is easy to make more money by investing. Small money makes small profit and big money makes big profit.

686	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"I think that saving money is better for three reasons.  
 First of all, wasting money without appropriate plans is very dangerous. In the future, we do not know what happens to us. For example, all of us can face unpredictable and serious accidents such as physical accidents or economic difficulties. In these cases, if we do not have emergency money or plans, we will face to bankruptcy. We can never recover these enormous damages. 
 Second, we can make more money by saving or investing instead of just spending money. Today, not only rich guys, but also normal people invest to stocks and real estates. Spending money without plans is just same with wasting money. As a result, we will lose opportunities to duplicate more money. Some people say the best way to become rich is to investments. It is too late after spending all of our money to invest. We do not have enough time to waste money because economic knowledge to manage money is very precious and learning this knowledge will be much more helpful to our lives. 
 For the last reason, it is about human's habits. Human is an animal of adaptation. If we start spending money freely, we will realize the feeling  and happiness of spending. Well, this is not always bad, but we might be afraid to go back frugal life. This phenomenon can be very serious unless we are economically strong or do not have restrained mind. We will sometimes overspend and this is likely to lead to financial difficulties. Self-realization by spending money and consuming is excellent and necessary for most people, but it is also important to have a habit of saving.
 For these three reasons, saving money is better for us, and we need to consider how to save money and manage them effectively.

"   I prefer enjoying my money when I earned it to saving my money.  There are two reasons that I agree with enjoying my money in short time. With enjoying money, we can encourage ourselves to keep working. The other points is that people can live more passionately when they focus on what they can enjoy in short term. In other word, we can call it 'YOLO'. 
   Some people work in their jobs for achievements or duty. But most people in modern society work for earning their money. And people earn money to spend their money for themselves. We can buy jewelry, or watch movies, or go on a trip with money. The idea that people will be able to do what they want is energy source that make humans operate. So it is impossible to work without this energy source. We need to spend our money for us. Then, we can be encouraged and avoid burning out. Enjoying money makes people keep work so it is surely important.
  The word 'YOLO' means ""You Only Lives Once"". This means present is truly valuable as much as future is. In traditional idea, people are used to think ""Humans should live and prepare for future."". And people used to call ""idiot"" or ""fools"" to people who focus and enjoy the present. I think this old idea is wrong. We only lives once so we should enjoy present as much as we can. Because future is unpredictable, preparing for future is not so important that we thought. Let's say there are two mans that earn same amounts of money. And one man spend  s money for delicious dinner everyday and the other man save money to buy his own house. After 10 years, which man will be  more happy? Old standard answer may be the second man. But the second man may fail to buy his own house because the price of house increase extremely or the money was stolen by someone. Otherwise, the fact that the first man enjoyed every dinner is never changed though the price of house increase extremely or the money was stolen by someone. I think this is true value of present. I recommend to spend money because present is much valuable than unpredictable future.
  People needs the compensation or reasons to keep work. We can get it by enjoying our money. People only lives once so the time at this moment is valuable. We should enjoy this moment. So, I think we should enjoy our money rather than save our money."	3	2	3	8

         You know the stories of people around you making a fortune by investing money through stocks or coins. Nowadays the exchange rate is changing very much so we have to save money and pursue greater happiness because we don't know the future.  So I'm going to explain why money should be saved on the grounds that the rate of inflation, uncertainty in the future, and a more stable life can be pursued.

         The first reason is a sharp change in inflation.  As time goes on, Prices go up rapidly over time.  So if you spend all your money right away. It is a loss compared to the inflation rate. For example, Real estate prices in Korea have increased by about 80% over the past five years. This mean that consumption that does not save and invest ends up in debt because it cannot keep up with inflation. So we have to look into the future and save money.

        The next reason is our future is uncertain. There must have been in your life when you need money to unexpected thing. For example, if you are injured and need to hospital bills, or if you need to lend money urgently. If you don't have money at times like this, you will be unhappy. Therefore, we should save money and use it in the future.

       The last reason is saving money can pursue stability in life. similar to the second reason above, you can live unaffected by your work by saving money and using it for the right place. and your chances of failure in life reduced. This makes a stable life, so that you can earn more money.

       To sum up, Saving money for the future will surely make your future certain. Moreover, It protect your happiness amid rapidly changing inflation rates. Of course, you can value instant happiness. However, if you experience saving money life, you will feel that long - term happiness is much more important than instant happiness. How about investing your happiness in the present to create a great future?"	3.5	3.5	3	10

"What would you do if you had 1 million won? There are lot's of things we can do with 1 million won. Some people would save money in the bank or some people would buy stocks. However, in my case, I would not save this money and I would use it right away. In other words, I think enjoying money is better than saving money for three reasons.
 First, we can feel happiness. In most cases, we earn money from our labor. For some people, labor may be their happiness, but for most people, labor is pain and stress. If we don't release this stress on time, our life will be ruined. Therefore we must release stress. There is a word 'Small but Certain Happiness' in Korea. For a happy and healthy life with labor, we should enjoy money to feel 'Small but Certain Happiness'.
 Second, future events are unpredictable. For example, in the future, there could be little inflation so the value of money saved in the bank may fall. Also for instance, we may not able to enjoy the money because our bad health issues. There is a Korean traditional saying about these situations. 'If you keep something too long, it would be poop'.
 Lastly, we need to learn how to spend money. My parents taught me that spending money is important as earning money. For example, we can develop ability to judge what is right consumption by using money steadily. This ability is very important because when we dont't have this ability, we can overspend our saved money at once or we can't spend any money. 
 In conclusion, I think enjoying money right away is better because of happiness, enpredictable future, and raise spending ability. I think money should be a tool to avhieve a life goal, not a goal in my l"	3	3	3.5	9.5

"Many people in these days say ""YOLO"", which means 'You Only Live Once'. They look for something to enjoy, and feel pleasure from doing that. It might be quite satisfying for people who are tired of work, but we can easily find out too much 'YOLO' makes your future worse if you don't have enough money.
 If you are rich, then there's nothing to worry about it. Just enjoy your life. If you aren't, however, you should stop spending money like that. Life is not a game. You cannot just reset your life. Anything can happen in our life, so we should insure ourselves. And the easiest method of insurance is money. That's why we have to save our money for 'me in the future'.
 Also, pleasure that we bought with money is mostly just temporary. It easily evaporates. However, money in our bank account relieves us, and it last until your death. However, this doesn't mean you should save all of your money. Important thing is, before you spend your money, just make sure that you have enough money for your future life. 
 We are living in capitalism society, and it means money is a power. It can be used for pleasure, but we all know that's just temporary. Save your money as an insurance for your future, and have a relief in your life."	2	2	2	6
691	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"It is better to save money than enjoying it when I earn money. There may be a lot of opinions about this question, but I want to say that saving money is better than enjoying it with two reasons. First reason is about habits. In general, people get paid higher as they get older. This fact makes people think that the money they currently earning is too small compared to the money they are going to earn. So some people says that they don't have to save money when they are young. It is true but the consumption habit is hard to change after it has formed once. If I get used to spend all money I got, I will never save money and this habit will be a drag when I need to spend a lump sum of money. Second reason is related to the importance of extra money. There could always be an situation to spend money unexpectedly. If I have extra money, it will be easier to handle the situation. So even it is small amount, extra money can give breadth of mind. Enjoying money can bring happiness for a short moment, but it can bring large problem later. So I want to say that Saving money is a lot better than enjoying it."	2.5	2	2.5	7

"If you want to die someday because you don't have money to treat cancer, you shall use money whenever you earn. Disaster always comes without notice. You should be ready for it anytime. Using money whenever you earn seems nice only at that time. It will be too late when you got trouble. 
 Even if god promises you that there will be such trouble in your life, you have to save money. Someday you will retire and gonna live without any income(or may not). You have to save money for that days.  People tends to appreciate instant happiness rather than future's. But the happiness of the future is important as much as for now. It has the exact-same-value. Also, saving money doesn't mean you have to live poor. You can use some for your own happiness while saving the left money. These are the reason why you have to save some money."	1.5	1.5	1	4
693	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"Some people use money as soon as they earned money, and others save money for the future. In my case, I prefer to save my money if it is much greater than I need to use because saving money has some benefits.
 First, saving extra money make it possible to use them for a bigger purpose. In Korea, there is a proverb that can be translated into 'many drops make a shower'. It means that even if it is too small to observe, if many of them are gathered together, it can be a great one. So, by saving only a small amount of money can helps you use them for a greater purpose like giving gifts to friends, buying expensive products, or having a travel.
 Second, saved money will help you in the case for inevitable use. It may sound similar to the first reason, but it is quiet different. As we live our lives, there are many  incidents that forces us to spend money. It could be an accident, illness, or disasters. If we don't saved money for those incidents, if we encounter those situations, we will have hard time creating insufficient money. So, to prevent this situation, we should save some extra money.
 Lastly, by saving money for the some time in the future, we can feel relieved. We can feel relieved due to the reason I mentioned in second and third paragraph. If we saved some money, we feel sure that even though we fall into an incident like illness, accident, or disasters, we can overcome these situations more easily because there is no worry about the money. Also, we feel relieved because there will be no worry to live my life because we can buy food, drinks, and enjoy social life with the saved money.
 In conclusion, I prefer to save extra money for the future because saved money allows me to use them for a greater purpose, it helps me to overcome some financial crisis, and makes me feel relieved."	3	3	3	9
694	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"  The common point of people who live in modern society is that all of them can't live without money. Thus, all people earn money by working to live a stable life. But there are big differences to use that money. Some of them use it immediately to buy things that they want to get, or do activity such as travelling or enjoy culture. However, in my opinion,  I believed that it is better to save money for some time in the future. And there are several reasons why I prefer save money. 
 First of all, we can prepare for the big spending by saving money. We have a lot of things that we should buy in our lives, such as a house, a car. And all of these are usually extremely expensive. For example, the cost of houses in Seoul is almost a billion won, and we should pay at least 30 million won to buy a new model of Grandeur of Hyundai. So, to buy all of things, we have to save almost of the money we earned.
 Next, we may have an unexpected accident like car crash or fire accident. It can cost a lot of money to recover it. But if you don't save money or buy an insurance, you can meet a big problem. Therefore, you should save money from time to time for these unexpected accident.
 Finally, we can prepare for later years by saving money in early days. It is obvious that we get ages by time goes on, and when we get older and older, our ability to work is decreasing since health problem and our responsibility to earn money increases because of increases family by marriage . So we must start saving money for our retirement or our family.
 In conclusion, I strongly argued that saving money should never be the second place. There are three reasons why I think so. First, by saving money, we can ready for the big spending such as buying  a house or a car. Furthermore, we can get an unexpected accident too. Lastly, we can prepare for our later years, like retirement or marriage. For these reasons, I believed that it is better to save money for some time in future than enjoy money when we earn it. So how about saving money right now?   "	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

697	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"I prefer saving money. There are three reasons why. 
 First, we have long time to live. We will live normally about 80 years old. But the time we earn money is shorter than that. So we should save some money that we earn for the old age. Our lives are long, so I think we have to save money to prepare for unemployment and unexpected 
situations through savings in order to live well for the rest of our lives. 
 Second, saving money in my bankbook itself gives me satisfaction. I like it because I can compensate for my efforts by saving money in my bankbook. Saving money in my bankbook gives me a sense of stability and happiness, so I think it's better to save money because it's longer and easier than spending it right away.
 Lastly, saving money will help you manage your future property. I don't think saving money is putting it in a bankbook. I think it's not just saving money without spending it in your bankbook, but also investing in stocks and other places to save money. Therefore, if you spend money right away, you will have to be relatively inexperienced in managing it. This means that it will be more difficult to manage future property. Therefore, I think that saving money in advance and managing property in advance will help them become independent without the help of future acquaintances and family members. Therefore, in order to manage one's property well, one must save money.
 Because of these three reasons, I think saving money is better than enjoy using it."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
698	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"I think it is better to save money for future than to use it immediately to enjoy. The reason why I think so is that I think financial freedom(or independence) is very important in this capitalistic society for living without unhappiness. What I mean for the financial freedom is, the state that can retain standard of living without any work. I think it is essential because of two reasons.
 First, I do not want to work which I don't like to do just for maintaining life. I think life's main purpose is happiness, and life with boring work will be greatly unhappy. However, if i don't have enough money, I should do any work to keep my lifestyle. I put very high value on freedom.
 Secondly, I cannot work after get old because my body will weaken. If my asset is insufficient at that time, there will be critical problem in my life.
 So, how can we achieve financial freedom? I think the key point for it is to make a system that brings me a positive cash flow. And the easiest way for it is using capital. For example, we can use stock to own a part of companies, which is one kind of capitals. S&P500, one of the most popular stock market index of USA, have shown annual average of 10~15% growth rate for last 10 years. From a simple calculation, we can live just with investment income if we own 300 times of asset we use per month(I supposed the annual average rate of S&P500 as 10%, and ratio of stock as 50%).
 In conclusion, I think it is significant to get financial freedom in life, and I think saving money and using it is the easiest way for it. Therefore I think to save money for future is more important than using it promptly."	3	2.5	2	7.5
699	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"I think it is better to spend my money and enjoy with it. I have two reasons for that.

First of all, if you enjoy your money when you earn it, you can be more happy when you work.
Working is hard for everybody. But generally, no matter how much you are tired or unhappy when working, you have to keep working to live. And I think if we have to do what we don't want to, it is more better if we feel more happiness when we do it. There is a famous Korean phrase which mean ""If you can avoid it, enjoy it."" And I think one way to enjoy our work is to use money that we earned from working and feel happiness through it.

Secondly, being happy today is more important than unclear future.
Every man wants to buy something. That can be a nice dinner with chicken or a new smartphone. And if you don't have to collect money for special reason, using your money for something you want can be a great happiness. And I think not buying everything you want just for collect money some case that we don't know what, when it is in future is sacrificing today for tomorrow. There is a word I read from some book I love which is ""Carpe diem."" It means 'Seize the day."" I think today's happiness is the most important thing in our life.

That was the reasons that I think enjoying your money is better to save it for the future. Thank you for reading my essay."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
700	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"   Generally, we spend money buying foods or clothes to live our daily lives. Some sudden events can happen accidentally that require some of our money. But if we weren't prepared, we can't afford to solve that problems. I think it is better to save my money for some time in the future and there are about 2 reasons of it.

    First, as I wrote before, there can be some sudden accidents that we couldn't expect. For example, let's think about the situation that you broke your leg by an accident. But if you enjoy your money when you earn and not save, definitely you weren't prepared to afford for it. So your wound my be worsen and after you earn money later, it would require more money to be cured. Resulting you can't enjoy your money after that accident. Although I gave you a specific example, there can be similar events that can be worsen if you weren't ready to pay for it.
     Second, you can earn more money if you manage your money that you saved well. There are some ways to get money like investigating, resulting more income so that you can enjoy more money in the future. Since they need some money called 'seed money' to make a profit, you had to save some of your income.

    Spending money to enjoy immediately would give you an prompt satisfaction. But thinking about the reasons I gave above, I think just spending money isn't a smart behavior at all. So I recommend you to enjoy essential amount of money to live then save some part of your money to enjoy pleasure longer and more."	2	2	2.5	6.5
701	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"I would suggest him to use all of money to buy a car because of several reasons. Vacation is short, but we can ride a car for a long time and we can get more effects from buying a car. They are not a opposite arguments, so it is hard to compare them, but buying a car would be better than going on vacation.
 First, vacation is a short choice, car is a long choice. When we go to the vacation and take some rest, maybe we would feel great. But, that feeling will disapear in a short time. Usually we go to the vacation about some weeks~1 month. Actually, 1 month is not a short time, but when we compare it with car, it becomes very short. If we use all of money for it, we will feel something strange after the vacation. We can experience other culture, eat many delicious foods, do expansive activity like sky diving, and take a rest with vacation. The true is that we can't get something usefull to us except for some gifts. It would be very short fun, very short choice. On the other hand, if we use  all of money to buy a car, we can ride it for a really long time. If we didn't make a car accident and keep a car clearly, we can ride it about many years. It's really longer than vacation. 
 The next reason is from the effect of the choices. Maybe almost people would agree that vacation have some positive effects. But as we said above, those short effects can't help our real life. And when we come back to our home, we will feel tired, it is hard to work again. However, car gives us so many good effects. The biggest one is convinience. If we have a car, we can go more various place easily and fastly. For example, in KAIST, it is hard to go to the other place cross the Gap river without car. Even if we don't choose vacation, we can go vacation easily with a car. And we can go to the work easily. The second effect of car is about money. We can save money with car. Without car, we need to use subway, bus, taxi, and some borrow mobility like electric kickboard. If we save this money for a year, it will be very big money. And when we go to the vacation with car, we can choose more places to go, but the money will saved a lot. Train and bus costs almost over the 50000 won. 
 To sum up, by these reasons, car is longer choice and car gives us more good effects, using all of money to buy a car would be the better choice. In modern life, car is one of the good things for our life. Even if we go to the meating, having car is great effect to match to other people. It doesn't mean that vacation is not good. It just mean car has much more advantages than vacation. If we choose vacation, we will happy for that short time, but we will regret our choice for a long time."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
702	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"In the beginning of starting to immerse into the given fantastic imagination, let us say ""Congratulations!"" to our virtual unknown friends. And next step is surely to recommend strongly to buy a car; because, we have two reasonable reason why a car is better than a vacation. Now let us find out why a car is more valuable.
First of all, we are in huge pandemic over the whole world. It means that we cannot enjoy dream experiences due to COVID19. Even though we shoot a vaccine more than twice, it seems be not enough to prevent the virus perfectly. There are a number of people who struggle with this terrible virus all day long to save lives as many as possible. It is not considered as a worst behavior to go on vacation; however, our hearts say that we cannot cross the line. We could go on a vacation, but it must not as like as we imagine. It is not good idea to go on a vacation while global pandemic with spending such a great amount of money, which could buy a car.
Second reason for buying a car is trivial; because, car is definitely convenient, financial, and useful. If we have a car, we can go anywhere we want at anytime. It is really big advantages especially in this pandemic situation. With considering the specific city where we live in, it is much clear to buy a car is better choice. Daejeon is famous city for good road and traffic to car drivers. In contrast, public traffic is not well-established. It is hard to go even near place by buses, since too small buses are provided. Moreover, a car can be more efficient choice than bus or taxi, because we don't need to pay money each time we use it. Some people could be worried about its fixed cost; however, it becomes more necessary as we are being an adults, a part of our society. As a result, convenience by buying a car is almost necessary to our life.
In conclusion, with these two strong and remarkable reason, it is better to buy a car than to go on a vacation. Pandemic is cautious problem these days, and advantages of a car is permanent. If we can do a survey about this problem, everybody would agree to buying a car. Lastly, with sincere congratulation, buying a car is most reasonable choice for our virtual friends."	3.5	3	3.5	10
703	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"There are many ways to use money to enjoy our lives. For example, buying a car or going on a vacation. Although some people prefer to buy a car rather than going on a vacation, I strongly suggest to go on a vacation for following reasons.

The first reason is that going on a vacation is more memorable thing. Buying a car could give someone happy for a few while, but if he or she use it for a long time, the car would be just a car. There will be no difference between the new car and other cars. However, the happy memory of vacation lasts very long time. At any time, he or she would think of beautiful vacation that he or she had gone.

In addition, it is allowed to enjoy vacation with friends while buying a cars could not. It is more joyful when someone enjoys something with his or her friends. He or she could go on a vacation with their friends and make some unforgettable memories. On the other hand, even if he or she buy a new car and ride with friends, it would not be an unforgettable memory for friends. Because the only one who enjoyed the riding was just him or her.

Despite the two strongest reasons that written in above two paragraphs, some people claim that car is long-lasting device while vacation is just short-term happening. However, the time is not important. The important thing is his or her memories. People always find joyful things in whole lives. It is because the happy memories about the joyful things will make people's lives happier. Many joyful events will waiting after the vacation or buying a car. So we should choose not the long-lasting event, but the event that could make long-lasting memories.

To sum up, memories from the vacation are more memorable, last longer and it could be made by together. For these reasons, I strongly argue that going on a vacation would make people's lives happier than buying a car. Among the other joyful things, going on a vacation is still good choice, so I strongly suggest to go on a vacation."	4	3.5	3.5	11
704	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"  Of all the debates that surface our society, it is obvious that 'Which would you suggest if a friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car?' is a controversial and interesting problem. Although some people may suggest that buy a car, I believe that use the money for going on vacation is better for two reasons.
    First, experience is the most important thing through human's life. If my friend uses his or her money for going on vacation, he or she can have a beautiful and interesting experience by the decision. The experience can be his or her foundation and by that, if my friend meets several problems, he or she can solve them wisely based on his or her experiences. Using money for going on vacation can give some inspiration and special experiences to my friend. 
    In addition, buying a car spends more money. Both I and my friend are about 20 years old. We do not have enough money except the received money. Buying a car is not the end. Such as oil and tax are necessary for maintaining the car. However, generally, people whose age is about 20 years old may not have enough money for them. Thus, buying a car is not a wise choice.
    Even though there are two reasons of spending money for going on vacation, some people suggest that by buying a car, people can freely go whereever they want. I partly agree with their opinion. If someone has a car, they can freely move. However, as I mentioned, we are about 20 years old and do not have enough money. 20 is an age for having several experiences. Car can be bought when they grows up. However, a special experience is not able to be given. Experience is more important than car. Thus, that opinion is not so pursuasive.
   For the aforementioned reasons, If a friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car, the friend should go on vacation. It will be a fundemental power of your life and a way of using money wisely. If you have a chance like that, do not hesitate and go on vacation."	3	3	3	9
705	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"  If my friend has received some money and asks me what do you recommend whether to go on vacation or to buy a car, I would recommend to go on vacation because of these three reasons. 
  First, a car needs extra money. The car owner should spend maintain fees such as car insurance, money for oil, and washing fee. The maintain fee is not cheap for common students. Also, if my friend lives in a dormitory,  he should look for parking places. In addition, he could be a public driver among his friends, because other friends usually don't have their car, so they might let him drive his car when they go on a trip or have some schedules. These things could make him tired.
 Next, if we get older there are fewer chances to go on a long trip. If we go to higher grades in university or after graduating from university, it is hard to make some long period of time for trip. We would get more and more tasks to do and concerns from outside, so it is good to go long trip as young as possible.  
 Lastly, going on vacation could inspire people. A long trip in other country or countryside lets people get time for thinking themselves. Also, meeting new people and interacting with them could inspire people. These experiences are much valuable than buying a car because inspiration could suggest a new way for life or make some good habits.
 To sum up, extra fees for car, the value of going trip as soon as possible, a trip can give some inspiration are the reasons for going vacation is better than buying a car. This thinking method adjusts not only choosing among car and vacation but also many choices among we met in our life. "	4	4	4	12
706	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"Most people have their own standards for the choice. Someone thinks going on vacation is happier than buying a car. On the other hand, another one thinks that buying a car is more valuable. Like this, there is no answer for this situation. Nevertheless, I want to give one suggestion for my friend. I will talk about why going on vacation is more valuable for using some money.
 At first, we can get lots of experiences from a vacation. Going on vacation means that we will face new situations and cultures. From these experiences, we can get not only valuable memories but also a new view. It's really hard but important to see as the view that is different with an original one. Going on vacation is really good chance to get a new view. Memories and a new view from new experiences will make you grow yourself. Especially, if you are undergraduate, it comes close to you. 
 Secondly, going on vacation can give us leisure. Most undergraduates in Korea don't have enough leisure. We have just walked and walked for the next step. Our society doesn't give us leisure. Leisure is that we have to get by ourselves not someone. As the view of this point, going on vacation is really good chance. Sometimes, a new place that is far from where we have studied and worked can make some leisure. Therefore, there are lots of people who want to travel for leisure. Don't be afraid and take your chance for leisure.
 Of course, someone thinks that a new car last longer than a trip. Actually, it's fact that we can see a new car and get a happiness from it for a long time. Then, let's think about our experiences that we got new things. Do new things have given us a satisfaction and a happiness until now? I can say the answer is no confidently. The car can last long, but the happiness from it can't.
 From these reasons, I want to suggest to go on vacation than to but a car. If you have difficulties to select one choice, please think about what can make you be happy for a long time. Values from experiences and leisure don't lie. Deciding for using some money have to be done carefully. For the last, I can just tell to my friend ""Of course, it's all up to you."""	3.5	3	3	9.5
707	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"After being adults, people could be more free about earning and using their own money than before 20s. So, there are many kinds of management their money. Although some people argue that they want to use money for their happiness in present, I think that young people have to keep their money instead of wasting money for the following reasons

First, save money is one of the most important mission in human's life. Human can't work forever but they need money forever. So, most people plan their life older. For example, people desire to get their own house because they can't alive anymore without house. 
Young people should not waste money because saving money is a kind of planning old life.

In addition, using money for present is loosing the chance to earn money because of the investing. In modern times, most people buy stocks for investing. Some people says that stock market is too risky. I agree with this state a little but there are some way that has no risk. Actually, these ways cannot earn huge money. However, it is the way to earn money without work in positively. So, people shouldn't waste these chance.

Despite ample evidence in support of the argument in this essay that the importance of saving money in young period, some people claim that wasting money is a kind of happiness. However, young people need to use their money more reasonable. Modern words like 'YOLO' make people spend money without thinking about their future life. But people can alive more than 80 years nowadays. So we have to think about future life more and more. Especially ab"	3.5	4	3.5	11
708	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"Most people dream to earn money with no work. For example, almost everyone want to get the first place of LOTTO. And imagining about how to use that money is also happy and fun. Suppose you obtained some money, so you planned to use all of it either to go on luxury vacation or to buy a car. Then buying a car would be better than going on vacation.

First, buying a car is better because it gives more happiness in friend's entire life. Happiness generated by vacation and buying a car should be compared. If the friend chooses to go on vacation, he can gain happiness because he will feel he is escaping from daily routine, and vacation would be very comfortable. But note that these type of happiness is temporary. If the vacation is over, the happiness will be gone. However, if the friend chooses to buy a car, his or her life become more comfortable for at least 10 years, because a car can be operated at least 10 years in general case. So buying a car gives him almost permanent happiness, which is more worthy than short-term happiness. 

Second, he can get more motivation by buying a car. Quite many people set goals like buying a car, or buying a house. And there is a phrase that is used very popularly, ""Dream of buying my car."" It implies buying a car is important milestone of our life. If the friend selects to buy a car, he'll think that his life is going successful. And people usually obtain motivation when the milestone is archived, so it can give a motivation for remaining life. In a contrast, we can't feel proud by going on vacation as many as buying a car. It can be a one of the bucket-lists, but that's maximum. It can't be a milestone or must-do goal for example. So vacation cannot give much motivation at all.

In addition to happiness and motivation, buying a car has no risk also. There are some people who regret their long-term travel, because they think that they lost something in their life such as chance to earn money. If he decided to go on vacation, he should give up to meet with other friends, to obtain some money, and to But there is no person who regret their consumption of a car, because buying a car isn't use any resource of life. It only makes the life better, with no risk. So buying a car is a better choice, with a perspective of checking risk.

In conclusion, buying a car is a better choice than going on vacation because buying a car gives more happiness, more emotion of proud, and less risk. This situation, receiving much money from other person, doesn't happen commonly, but discussing with these type of topic is very meaningful because choosing a choice with bigger worth is very important in our life, and it helps to select more worthy selection in real life. Let's practice making selection in real life by discussing with these topics."	3.5	4	3.5	11

710	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"  How to spend money is always a big issue for everyone. There are various choices to spend money, and each person have to choose only a few choices. If a friends of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car, I will suggest to go on vacation. There are some reasons why I suggest to go on vacation.
   Firstly, going on vacation can give some valuable experiences. Since almost everyone feels tired and has a difficult time during working or studying in daily life, they need some time to relax, go to a new place and meet new peoples. For doing this, they will be able to stress out and  experience something new. Going on vacation can be one way to refresh their life. 
   Someone might be say that buying car is better since they can use that car for such a long time; for about 5 years even more. However, they have to spend more money for using car; for oils, washes, repairs, and so on. That is the second reason why I suggest to go on vacation. Car is required more money to use not only the exact price of the car. On the other hands, in case of going on vacation, it is not required any extra money. This facts will be important for most of the students.
    For those reasons which are stated, going on vacation is a way to refresh and is not required extra money, I would suggest to go on vacation rather than to buy a car.  "	3.5	3.5	3	10
711	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"If my friend has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. I would suggest to go on vacation for the following reasons.

First reason is military issue. All of my friends should go to the military for 2 years. Although they buy a car, they can't use the car for the 2 years. However, going on a vacation would be a good memory for him. We can't take a car to the military, but we can take a good memory. Also, we can buy a car whenever we want after the military.

In addition, we wouldn't have enough time for traveling after the graduation. University student have a long vacation between the semesters. We can use the long time for a trip. Also, we have little chance to go on a trip with lots of money during the university life. So, going on a vacation at young age with lots of money would be a great experience.

Finally, there are great transport system in Korea. We can go anywhere with the transport such as bus, subway, train, etc. So I think we don't need a car during the student.

For these reasons, I think this time is the best time to trip. So I would suggest to go on vacation rather than buying a car."	3	3	3	9
712	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"Choosing between using money for instant happiness and investing for the future is not easy problem for most people. Some people argue that using money makes people become positive and active. I believe that the using all of the money is not a reasonable plan for the following reasons. 

First, using all of the money without any clear plans is definitely dangerous because we can face unpredictable events whenever. For example, there is possibility of getting serious illness or accidents. If those significant events occur, we should solve those problems with money in most of cases. In this point, using all of the money is risky decision, and we should make through plans to use money effectively. We can prepare more stable future by managing our money with appropriate plans. 

Despite ample reason stated above, some people say that it is important to learn not only how to earn or manage money, but also how to consume money. Those opinions are true statements, but the main problem is using all of the money. Using all of the money to go on vacation or to buy a car is likely to be wasting money for instant happiness. These kinds of consuming may not teach how to use money constructively for you. Learning how to consume money is fundamentally possible when we use money for our future with background about economic knowledge. 

In conclusion, using all of money for instant desire can never be a reasonable decision for reasons stated above. Every people should know how to invest and manage their money. Of course, to go on vacation and to buy a car are good experiences and sometimes necessary in life. However, more important thing is not to waste money without plans."	3.5	3	3.5	10
713	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"You may have heard the word ""YOLO"". It means ""You only live once"". This word appears in this decade. Because, people's idea changed from always preparing for future to enjoying precious present. And I think this change is one of development. I think we should enjoy our present as much as we can. I would suggest my friend to spend his or her money to go on vacation or to buy car. There are some people that argue ""prepared man becomes winner"". And they say we need to save money for future because life is unpredictable. But I think ""We can spend our money as much as we want"" with two reasons. First is not to regret before unpredictable death, and the other is present time is more valuable than future time.

   First of all, we shouldn't regret before unpredictable death. We often think our life is stable and we will live at least 80 years. In fact, it is nothing strange if we die tomorrow. We may crush by a car in street, or get heart paralyze with medically mysterious reasons. There are much more risks to die than we think. But living life with scare of death can't be solution. There are many thing that you may miss with the idea. Meanwhile, we will regret less even we die tomorrow, if we enjoy today, yesterday, and our whole life. ""Live today as it's end of your life."" Enjoying today is the best way to archive no-regret-life. 

  Despite the support of my opinion is proper, some people argue that ""We should prepare for future to protect our body and normal life from unpredictable disaster."" However, there are much events that we can't predict and protect ourselves. For example, one man never protect himself if World War III happens. He may regret that he didn't eat delicious food or go on a vacation before World War III. We should do what we want today because we don't know about tomorrow.


  The other reasons is present time is more valuable than future time. Many people say ""The feel of lifetime become faster when we get older"". Speed of lifetime is equal to your age. Your 1 hours in present is precious than your 1 hours in future. We can enjoy and feel happiness much more if we do something fun in present than future. The time with young age is precious. It doesn't make sense that spending valuable today to prepare less valuable tomorrow.

  I will suggest my friend to go on a vacation or buy a car. Then he or she must enjoy present life with travel or driving his car. He may not regret even if he die tomorrow because he did what he want.  He make a very nice deal in his life because he didn't exchange valuable present and less valuable future. "	3.5	3.5	3	10
714	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"You have experience that feel uncomfortable when you did not have a car. However, there is chance to make your life more comfortable than before. If you have received some money and should plan to use all of money, Which one do you select between to go on vacation or to buy a car? Although some people would like to enjoy their vacation more fully by using some money, I believe that buying a car is more valuable in terms of more comfortable and more consistent.

First reason is that a car have consistency. Spending your money to go on vacation do not have consistency. If you use the money to go on vacation, money just disappear and that's all.  However, buying a car have consistency. So, we can  use a car for a long period. it is better enjoying your life longer period than shorter period.

Second reason is that the car can upgrade your life value. Many people have experience that they almost wet when they are going to their works on rainy day. It make people angry and anxious. Moreover, you have to use many time to go on vacation if you do not have a own car. For that reason, buying a car is upgrade your life value not only in life areas but also in going on vacation.

Despite this two big advantage, Some people still spend their money to go on vacation; Because, they argue that going on vacation give us good memories in your whole life and  give us chance to see the world having wider view. It is right in some part. However, when we see the life in long term, spending money to go vacation do not leaving any effectiveness. it makes us not stacking our poverty.

For aforementioned reasons, I believe that buying a car is more valuable choice than going on vacation when you have received some money and plans to use all of it. you can consider abstract thing like going on vacation to spend money as most valuable thing. However, when you consider your whole life, What choice makes your life more efficient and more comfortable than spending some money to go on vacation?"	4	3.5	3.5	11
715	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"Imagine that you earn a price and you can use the money for going on vacation or buying a car. Although some people argue that going on vacation is the best choice, I believe that buying a car is the best choice for the following reasons.
  First, we can use more money if we choose buying a car. In the most cases, car is expensive than cost of vacation. For example, let's suppose that the vacation destination is Europe. Then, if it's not a peak season, the cost of the travel will be less than 10 million won. On the other hand, when we choose SUV or Sedan, the expense of the car will be more than 30 million won. Therefore, when we choose buying a car, economically, we can earn more than 20 million won.
  Despite ample evidence in support of the argument in this essay, some people claim that memories with friends are the most important thing above all. In contrast, when we decide to receive car, we can make much more diverse of memory.  For instance, we can travel anywhere with the car. The only one thing you are required for the travel is the time. With the car, we can call our friends and we can easily go to trip. Traveling far away doesn't make memories special. The important thing is that enjoying together.
  For the aforementioned reasons, I indicate that buying a car is more rational choice than going on vacation. The reason for the suggestion is that we can earn more money and we can make various memories with friends. Choose car and go travel with that car!"	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
716	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"When people get this question, more than half would say ""buy a car"" because it remains until it breaks, and you can use it in everyday-life. However, I would suggest my friend to go on a vacation. There are two reasons for this.

Firstly, the important point of this question is that it's not a money earned for a work. People regret or feel guilty when they use their money, especially on an entertainment or an amusement. However, when it's not their money,-which means it's not a reward for their work- people feel less guilty. Thus, they can enjoy a vacation without concerns on their bank accounts.

Another reason is that these days, people don't have chance to get rest. Most of people in Korea have few days of vacation, which is not enough for resting. So it would be the best chance in their lives to get rest and enjoy freedom from everything that is depressing and annoying.

In summary, going on a vacation with free money will be a great choice for non-resting modern people. Buying a car would save their money, but they won't get wonderful memories in other countries."	3.5	3	3	9.5

718	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"I would recommend him(I will refer my friend as a male, because I don't have female friend) to go on vacation. There are several reason for that.

First, he would not need the car so much. There's no need to go far or move fast. Especially during pandemic crisis, actually we don't have to go anywhere. Using public transportation like bus and subway is cheaper, healthier and also faster too.

Second, traveling is beneficial in many ways. It can widen our sights and gives us a energy. It is proved that traveling has some kind of spiritual effect on human. If there's no such inspiration, having fun and making good memories is just find too. There's no regret in vacation, but car has.

Last reason is little personal. My father once told me that I should buy a car after I get old, at least 30 years old. That's because young driver's can easily get emotional and lose concentration while driving. It's true that many people who drivers fast are young. I thought that makes sense. Driving a car can be dangerous even if he is good at it.

To sum up, there's many disadvantage in buying a car. But he won't regret if he goes on vacation. So I would strongly recommend him to go on vacation."	3	3	2.5	8.5
719	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"If a friend of mine has received some money, I would recommend him/her to go on a vacation if he/she is in my age. Although both going on a vacation and buying a car have positive effects to my friend, I think going on a vacation is better than simply buying a car in several reasons.
  First of all, this moment of life comes only once in a lifetime. Some people say 'this moment is youngest moment of my life.' Like this quote, this moment of chance to go on a vacation only comes once in a lifetime. I guess most of us have experienced r situations like re-visiting a place where we have a good memory makes a totally different memories of that place. Even though we visit the same place, feelings and experiences are different due to one's present state. Present state of oneself creates experiences and that's the most precious thing you can get from traveling. If you pass the chance to go vacation to foreign place, there is no way to have another chance for those precious experiences. 
  Secondly, visiting a foreign place and having many new experiences makes you think bigger. In many countries, the government try to teach students by experiencing things and participating voluntarily to a lecture. Similarly, traveling a foreign place offers you a greatest classroom that can teach you and understand that place by experiencing things. You can actually be the place where you have seen on movies, dramas, books and magazines. Every experiences you had there becomes data, and those data will help you in some times in some ways as you live your life. Some people may argue that experiences evaporates fast, and there is nothing left after a vacation. But these people haven't really went on a vacation. Rather, they would have just followed someone else's vacation. 
  Lastly, if you buy a car, that's not simply buying a car, but buying a money-consuming machine. If you buy a car, from that moment, you have to pay taxes, insurance fees, gasoline fee, and money for managing a car safely. So, this means that buying a car requires regular money income to maintain the car. As an ordinary university student, it's hard to have a job for regular income while keeping up with university life. So I think it is better to have a car when you can manage it by oneself. 
  To sum up, going on a vacation is much better than buying a car because that moment never comes back, and experiencing many things will be helpful. Also, buying a car is not simply buying a car, but requiring regular income. So, I would recommend my friend to go on a vacation if he/she has received money, and enjoy every moment of that vacation."	4	4	4	12
720	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"It is very controversial problem that whether to go on a vacation or to buy a car when some money has been received. Some people think that to go on a vacation is more meaningful than to buy a car, but I will suggest that to buy a car is better choice to a friend for a following reasons.
 First of all, buying a car can also be the solution for going on vacation. It means that we can go on a trip by a car in later. It helps for saving a lot of money and time when going on a vacation in the future. So I think buying a car first, then using it for travel later is more efficient than just going on a trip. 
 Secondly, car is neccessary to our lives. We encounter a lot of situations that we should move to another place, such as go to school or work. And these situations usually happen every day of our lives, so car is useful when go to another place which is far from home. Despite of this reason, some people argue that we can use other vehicles like public transportaion or taxi without driving a car. However, using other vehicles is too inconvenient to move everyday. In case of public transportation, we should go to the station and it consumes additional time. And taking a taxi can be a more better solution, but it costs a lot to use everyday. Thus buying a car is the best option for a friend.
 In conclusion, I will suggest that buying a car is better choice than just going on a vaction. I feel like this because a car can be used for a travel in the future, and it makes more money and time-efficient trip. Also, car is very useful in everyday lives, so at least one of car is needed. To sum up, if you have received some money and have a problem whether to go on a vacation or to buy a car, then buy a car right now! It will be the best choice."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
721	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"    When you are earning money or when you suddenly get some money, You should choose what would you do with that money. The same goes for your friend. It is possible that a friend of yours has received some money and maybe He can use all of them to go on a vacation or to buy a car. I think it is better to go on a vacation with some money, Because a vacation fresh feeling and  If you have a car, you should pay more money for it.
     First, going on vacation can make people's feeling good. People who go to school and work in any company may be stressed a lot. Also, Repeated daily lives can be boring. In this situation, Travel might be the best solution for them. For example, I studying science at KAIST now, and I am trying to get good grades. However, it is not easy, but there are many times when I'm disappointed. So, when I  have a vacation, I travel to Jeju island or other regions to make new goals and change my mood. I think it is also good for friends. If friends get some money, and he uses all of them to go on vacation, He will not regret his choice. Some people said that playing games or relaxing at home can be better way to release stress. That may be true, but traveling will be a good choice for everyone.
    In addition, If a friend buys a car, money will be used continuously.  The Car uses oil not only when driving but also turning on the air conditioner and using navigation. Actually, my father says that cars are machines that eat money. I agree that argument. I don't think my friend has any more money if he buys a car. That's what it's a burden for us as students to drive a car. Even if he buys a car, he will not have enough money to gas it or anything else.  Although there are some students who had cars already, this fails to show every student can earn money to drive their car. So, I think Rather than buying an unbearable price, spending money on traveling will be better.
    Despite this experience prediction in support of the argument in this essay, some people claim that Buying a car is better choice. But this may make friend happy now, but he will regret it later. It is not too late to buy a car after making money or getting a job.
    To summarize, I want to recommend to my friends to use received money to go on vacation rather than buy a car. This choice save friend's money used to maintain his car. Also, By going on vacation, He will be able to stay brighter next semester. "	3	3	3	9

723	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"Going on vacation and buying a car are both very good choice. But we can choose only one of them, so I would suggest to buy a car. There are three reasons why. 
 First, to buy a car will help saving money. Car can save lots of money. Imagine that we go for swim this vacation. We have to go all the way to the swimming pool or ocean world. If we ride a bus, it will cost about 10,000 won and if we ride a train, it will cost even more. And when we are living in dormitory, there are many chance for us to go out side of the school. And usually we use taxi. It cost some money too. Some people might say that car need money for keep it work, but using taxi and train that are used to move will obviously cost more money. 
 Secondly, to buy a car can make our life more comfortable. At midnight or at noon, there are no enough taxi to ride. I`ve waited for taxi about 30 minutes last Sunday. I was wasting my time. But if you have car, you can save all that times. That time can be small but if it combines, it will be big enough to do something. And also it is easier to go somewhere I want. Bus is cheaper than taxi but there are many places that there are no bus station near by or the bus comes once in an hour. But if you have your own car, it is not even a problem. Some people could say that go on vacation will give you wonderful memory and it is more worth it than just saving some time or money. But I think we can make memories in the future my using the money and time we saved by using car. And also you can go driving with your friends to make good memory and it can be made only if you have your own car. So I think buying car is better choice. 
 My third reason why is that car can help go on vacation. If you choose to buy a car, you can choose anywhere in Korea to go on a vacation. You can drive all the way there so you do not have to think about the bus time or train time and it will make your vacation plan to be more flexible. At last summer vacation, I went Jeju island with my friends. After we arrived at airport, there are only 5 minutes left to catch a bus. This fact made us to be hurry up and some of my friends lost the bus. They had to wait for about an hour for bus to come. We had a plan to go see ocean near airport but because of bus schedule, we could not go for it. There were several similar problems during the vacation. But if we had a car, our plans would go at least better, and we would enjoy the vacation better. However, some people will say if you use money to buy a car, you can enjoy better quality of vacation. That opinion is right in some part. But what will you do in the next vacation? It will cost more money than the vacation using car. It is hard to save money that much every vacation. So if you see longer, buying car is better choice. 
 To sum up, because of three reasons in the essay I will suggest to buy a car. Buying car can save money by not using taxi, bus and train. And also it will be more useful because it can help me to go somewhere that I want even though there are no bus station near by. And lastly it can help me to make good vacation. Cars will help our plans to be more flexible. We do not have to waste time by catching taxi or changing bus so the trip could be more like the plan we make before the trip. So I suggest buying car than going on vacation."	3.5	4	3.5	11
724	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"When we get some money, we can use it for various ways, and going on vacation or buying a car can be good choice. However, Between those two choices, I believe that going on vacation is better. Let me introduce several reasons why I think so.
 First of all, I think value of experience is the main point. Experience of going on vacation in young age is priceless. We can widen our sight of view from such experience, and that would be extremely valuable asset for the left life. For example, I visited CERN in Switzarland three years ago. CERN is the biggest particle accelerator in the world. With that experience, my dream to be an engineer had grown.
 Second, especially if we go abroad, we can feel totally different culture, food and people from our country. Also, we may improve our linguistic ability and decrease afraid of talking with foreign people. For instance, I went to USA with my family when I was a student of elementary school. I was so afraid of using english to communicate with foreign people when I leave Korea. However, during traveling USA, that fear had decreased and communication had become more natural. It was very meaningful experience.
 Although there are ample causes for my argument as above, some people say buying a car is a better choice.
 Someone may say that we can sell the car after some time, so that we can save some money. However, I think the experience of going on vacation is more valuable than that some money. If someone really want to save money and be a rich, he or she should not buy a car, because car's price starts to since when he or she buy it. Also, a car need substantial cost to maintain it.
 Next, someone can argue that experience of riding car is more valuable than experience of going on vacation. I respect that opinion, but we can also just rent a car for riding. It is better way to get experience of riding a car with less money.
 For the above reasons, I want to suggest to go on vacation rather than to buy a car for my friend."	3	3	3	9
725	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"I think I'm going to suggest him/her to go on a vacation.

first, something he/she can earn from going on a vacation lasts forever.
If my friend buy a car, it will make my friend look rich and cool, but after 5 or 10 years, it will become just a piece of junk. And or he/she use all of the money, it will make him/her happy for short time but after that, he/she will change back to first place. But, if he/she goes on a vacation with that money, experience from that vacation, like various culture from visiting many country, or life style of people in the other side of the planet, will stay in his/her memory until he/she dies and make him/her become more wiser and help him/her make choices in his/her life.

Second, going on a vacation can make a person to grow up.
I think the most important thing of somebody is his/her humanity. good-looking face or a lot of money can be important too, but thing that makes somebody to like, love someone for real is his/her humanity.
Spending money for buying something expensive, like car or watch, or eating a nice dish can make a person happy, but can't change his/her inner heart. The situation in the question can be a life-time chance. As I said before, the experience that person can earn from a vacation can make him/her to grow up and become a better person.

I think from vacation, my friend can get something more greater than money. So I think he/she should go on a vacation with the money."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
726	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"In that situation, the discussions about how to use extra money remain at issue. Even if some people argue that it is better go on vacation with that money, spending money on buying a car is worthwhile with the following reasons.

  First, the car can help our daily-life. If someone uses the money to buy a car, then it enables him or her to reach distant places easily. Thus the person who have a car can go anywhere without the restrictions that they had;  they should walk between subway stations or bus stations, and should pay relatively expensive money to ride a taxi than riding a car. As a result, their next journey must be more liberate than using all of the money to go on vacation.
  In addition, the money, which can afford to buy a car, is too expensive to spend all to go vacation. The money that can buy a car must be over about 2,500,000 KRW even if the car to buy is a used one. With that money, everyone can have a chance to buy more valuable and useful stuff like a car than using the money to a temporary experience.

  Although sufficient reasons support the argument in this essay, some people still insist that using all of the money to go on vacation is more helpful. Nevertheless, like the reason stated above, using big money to experience something new would not be more useful than using the money to buy a car, which remains and can be used afterward. Also, if the friend need to buy a car in the future, spending the money on going vacation would just can be seen as wasting the money and the possibilities of experiencing more comfortable life with a car.

  In conclusion, the reasons stated above bear witness to why using the money to buy a car is better than using the money to go on vacation. Using the money for the future would give more value with the same money afterward. Why don't you use the money to buy a car?"	3	3	3	9
727	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"In the university lecture, the one part must be putted in grade requirements. That is attendance. But, some student said that it is also our right to go or don't go in class because they already paid money. I don't agree with that opinion. I have three reasons why student have to attend.
 First, that is the biggest reason of existence of university. University is the highest level education institute. The purpose of university is educating students and growing them up. If some students don't attend the class, it means they are standing with the opposite side of university. Can we define them ""University students""? I think we can't. 
  Second, social ability is also required part to graduate university. Some people can say that it doesn't matter students attend or not if they can get good test grades. Purpose of attendance is study. But, it's not true. That is misunderstanding about university. In high level university, high level students are also the member. Because human beings are social animal, human can be motivated, inspire by other people next to him. Crowding people is the one of the part that universities can do. 
  Last, university students eventually will be a face of their country, company, family, and so on. All society can't be run only using law. The moral part is needed to society. So, university students should make habits to behave morally  from university. If they graduate, they will be the core people in their society because they have abilities. If they act morally, it can be a good affect of entire society. 
  Because of development of internet devices, recent people don't think deeply. University is the most wonderful place to develop student's entire abilities. Don't waste that chance. That is not good choice to students, lecturers, universities, and societies. So, students should be required to attend classes."	3.5	3.5	3	10
728	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Many students don't like attendence. It is not different to university students. Some people believe that attend classes is duty of university students. I agree with that. There are two reasons.

First, it is rule. Some classes has not attendence score, and they don't need to attend class. But, most of classes have attendence score, and if you don't attend classes too much, you must study class next semester. It means most of class's rule is attend class. It is normal rule. University students must do university, and class rule, and class rule says attend class. So, attend classes is duty of university students.

Second, it is good for study. In covid-19 age, many schools and universities use video to study. It is hard to check attendence and focus class. So, many student's ability is lower than before. It means if you more attend class, you can get higher ability. So, attend classes is good to study, and study is duty of students. So, they must be attend classes.

There are two reasons that attend classes is duty of students. First is it is class's rule. There are no reasons that don't attend classes. If someone have enough reason, he can don't attend classes. Second is it is good for students. More attendence make better effective. There are some people that don't attend classes and do their own study like bill who create windows. But they are so little. University must consider many people. So, I agree that students must be required to attend classes."	3	3	3	9
729	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Graduating elementary school and middle school is mandatory for Korean. Also, while attending high school and university, attendance is mandatory. However, through my experience, I think students should not be required to attend all classes. There are three reasons.
First, class lecture is not effective for some students. For example, I like to study alone by reading textbook or searching Internet than listening to professor's lecture, so I often mute the lecture. 
Second, attending class is wasting time. Students have to get ready to go out, and move to building on time. It makes them busy and lose their free time. However, if they are not required to attend, they will be happy to use those remaining time.
Third, there are a lot of things that are more important than studying. For example, researching in lab, working as an Intern in big company, and preparing competition are more meaningful than studying. Also, experiences like making girlfriend, doing part-time job or joining club can be only done when we are student.
In conclusion, I believe that going to classes should be optional. I think it is better to let students use their time freely because some students are not suitable at lecture, and there are many things that are more important than studying."	3	3	3	9
730	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I believe that university students should be required to attend classes. 

The first reason is the university is where students go to learn something. It can be learning or technology. Attending classes would be the best way to achieve that goal most effectively.

Of course, there may be times when the purpose of life changes after entering the university. Some students may prefer to make money or try something new rather than learn something more. In this case, they may feel that they do not need to take a class. 

However, I don't think it's necessary to change the class to optional. Because most universities have a system called leave of absence. This is the reason that students who think like above can apply for a leave of absence and not take classes as much as possible. 

Therefore, I think students should be required to attend classes for two reasons above."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
731	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"There are many university students who do not want to attend classes which are out of their interest. Sometimes, I also feel repulsion about some classes. However, I believe that university students should be required to attend classes just like high school students. I have two reasons for my view.
 First, requirements about attending classes help students to think about their own dreams. I am studying in KAIST which is the most famous university in South Korea. However, I experienced that many of students do not have details about their dreams. I think this kind of students can think about their dreams by attending various classes. I also made details about my dream by taking classes from various departments. Therefore, university students should be required to attend classes for their future.
 Second, students can also learn from other students by attending classes. I think one of the most important positive effects of attending classes is that students can see how other students study. When I was in high school, there are so many geniuses. At first, I scared by them. But, as time goes, I can learn from them and improved myself, and this process is not different in universities. Therefore, university students can learn from other students who take same course, so attending classes should be a requirement.
 University students are adults, but there are not many students who think like adults. They have no dreams or plans about their future. I think the role of universities is to help them. In this perspective, the requirement about attending classes is clearly helping students to find their dreams, and learn from other students. However, if students are allowed to take classes selectively, they will have narrower views about their future. Therefore, I argue that university students should be required to attend classes."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
732	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"In my opinion, Going to classes should be optional for students. 
Because, attending classes is up to our responsibility. when we don't attend class, we get penalty. If you don't attend class, you should prepare the penalty and have the responsibility on your doing. So, there are optional, you attend class or fail the class. And I think there are no students who pick the later one. 
Second reason is that there are 'University' students, not 'High school'. In Korea, the standard of adult is 20 years old above. So, there are big difference between high school students and university students. In High school, we must go to high school classes. Also, classes are not picked by ourselves. But, when we 20 years old and university students, we just choice the classes what you like. So, most important thing is 'free to choice' when we are university students. Because of this reason, I think going to classes are also part of 'free to choice'.
Lastly, when we look at most of syllabus, there are no contents about 'students should be required to attend class.' only contents about penalty if you miss the class. For example, If you miss the class more than 3 times, you fail the class. This means that going to classes should be optional for students.
So, because of this three reason, University students should choice whether attend classes."	3	2.5	2.5	8
733	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"  There are some people who believe that going to classes should be optional for students. But I don't think this is a good idea. I think students should be required to attend classes. And there are two reasons.
 First, all classes are important for students. I don't think there are classes that students don't have to learn. If students think that they don't have to learn a class, they just could drop that class. So, if students think a class is valuable, they should attend class because all classes are important.
 Second, attending classes is respect to the professor. Professors try to provide high-quality classes to students. For students, attending classes is the least respectful expression for professors. If students don't respect their professor, the professor doesn't have to respect them. So, if students want the professor to respect them, they should attend classes.
 To sum up, university students should attend classes because all classes are valuable, and attending classes means respect to the professor."	3	3	3	9
734	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"    ""Do University students have to attend classes?"". This topic has been an important topic for a long time among students. Some students think that attending classes is up to themselves, so they think students can choose whether to go class or not. While others think attending classes has a lot of benefits, so they think students should attend classes. In my opinion, I have same idea with latter one, and I will give 2 benefits to justify my opinion. 

    First, Textbook can widen student`s view, but it is important to listen instructor`s class to fully understand things in the textbook. In other words, class instructors have much more experiences about the topic in textbook, so student can attain more specific details about topic which textbook don`t describe.
    Second, In the classroom, student may meet other peers who is also interested in same topic. The opportunity of meeting and communicating with other peer can be a powerful method to learn. In case of students don`t know exactly about the textbook contents, they can get correct answer by debating about the contents. Also, if some students ask questions and you answer to them, then students can strengthen their knowledge by reviewing what they asked.
    For these reason, I think taking classes can have great"	3.5	3	3	9.5
735	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Attendance is one of good ways to check student's sincerity. Today, almost every university uses attendance to make scores to students, so students who wants to get high score should attend to school every time. But, some people say attendance should be optional for students. And I think it will be better to give students their own right to attend in class. Now I'll explain some reasons why I think like this.
 
 First, all students who attend in class do not focus on class well. Each students has their own life cycle. Some students may go to sleep 12 a.m., and some students may go to sleep 5 a.m. If we say these students need to attend in class which is held in 9 a.m., students who sleeps in 5 a.m. will be hard to concentrate in class and will get low grade. So I think it is important  to take lectures when students want, and attendance needs to be checked very roughly.
 
 Next, it can give critical impact for student's score. Although attendance score takes low percentage of whole score, if student misses one or two classes, some points get reduced for the student's score, and it can change student's grade. And also, the student who missed the class will have some difficulties to understand the part that he/she missed, and it can result in decline of score. So I think lectures can be heard when students want to hear.
 
 Of course, I agree that attendance is good way to evaluate student, but because of these reasons, I think attendance must be modified roughly in some ways. One of the way to give attendance more roughly is upload video lectures in some platforms, and give time to watch the lectures like a week or month. This is just one example, and there will be many good ways to make more easy to get attendance. Due to COVID-19, now we have some knowhows to give online lectures or video lectures, and this will make more efficient ways to check student's attendance."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
736	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I've also not attended classes sometimes because of inevitable reasons. 
But I don't think that was false.
In my opinion, attendence to classes in university is not obligued. 

First reason is that university students are adults, not adolescents. 
The biggest meaning of adult is the person who can act freely and get responsibility from his behavier. 
In university class, the attendence points are existed and it is kind of responsibility to students.
Also, not getting knowledges or essential informations from lectures can be resposibility to students who don't attend to classes.

In Second, people in university, can cope unexpectable situations more than high school, or middles school students.
For example, different with adolescent students, some of university students can drive a car, so they can get car accidents.
In case of male students in Korea, they should go periodic military training once in a year even they've done military mendatory service.
And in special case, if somebody is considering about changing his department or university, I don't think that he should select effecient way and nobody can't compel to him about attendency.
Or, the students would drop the class too.

So I think that attendence to classes in university shoud be freely for students. But I don't want to get responsibility by attendency points and grades, so I would like to attend classes most always."	2.5	2.5	2	7

Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I think class attendance should be optional for students. There are three reasons to support my opinion. 
Firstly, the university is the school for people who want to study more about their interests. So, university students should learn about the way of study their own. But if there exist an obligation of attending classes, I think it is not different from high school or middle school. 
The second reason is that some people have their own study styles. It is similar to the first reason. For my experiences in university, self-study makes some students' ability of study higher than lecture-based study. I think participating lectures might be waste of time for that students. And just assignments and exams may be helpful to them. 
Finally, if students are absent the class, they would miss the important information of the lecture. And I think students will respond that missing information themselves. Therefore, I think checking the attendance for each student is not necessary. 
In conclusion, I think university students would study themselves, and some people like to study with their own styles. For these reasons, I think universities should give free attendance to students."	3	3	3	9
738	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"From elementary school to high school, it is necessary to attend classes everyday without student has special reason. However, the students of university can absent some classes if they want. Some people think that they have to attend all the classes, but I think that going to classes in university should be optional for students. There are three reasons why university students have to decide there attendance.
First of all, university students can judge which is more important to them, classes or other activities. The reason elementary school students are forced to attend is because they do not have enough judgement and moderation. So they can absent the classes with rational reason. However, university students are enough grown to judge that the class is necessary to them. 
Second, university students have a lot of activities that is not related to university. A lot of university students have to prepare for getting job, going abroad, etc. Some of these activities are much important than classes, and as I said before, university students can judge to attend class or do activity. Of course, we can submit some documents to absent, but there are some works that important to student but not reasonable for absent. With optional attendance, students can freely do various activities that they want.
Last, university classes are not that important in life. From elementary school, we learn basic thing that are quite important and useful for living our lives. That is the another reason why the school force students to attend the class. However, university classes are advanced education which is option in our life. Why should I be forced to attend classes where I even pay?
For these three reasons, I believe that attendance in university have to be optional."	3.5	3.5	3	10
739	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"There might be lots of opinions for university students to attend their classes unconditionally. However, my thought is a little different. I'd like to insist that university students should have their choices to participate in on/off-line lectures. There are two reasons to support this viewpoint.
 At first, it violates the purpose of the university. The university needs to be clearly different from elementary, middle, and high school. Because the age of 20 is enough to control their schedule, the applying and taking classes depend on students absolutely. To grade an attendance score and control all students is an act to obstruct students' freedom excessively.
 Second, unlike high school students, college students do not spend their time studying only. Since early 20s are economically independent, they may have to focus on other activities such as part-time jobs or employment. In other words, it means that there would be many events which are inevitably missed in class. In this situation, re-taking courses due to a lot of deduction in attendance scores can confuse many people.
 However, it is true that not managing attendance score completely can lead to students' neglect of study. So, I'd like to suggest putting a lower bound between attendance and test scores. If the test scores are higher than a certain score, high grades are given regardless of attendance scores. However, if the test scores are low, the attendance score would be checked and additional points are given for high rates of attendance. Using this alternative, there'll be no opportunity to abuse this system. 
 In conclusion, the college don't have a permission to control their students by checking their participation. But, the professor can give them some online lectures for students missed in previous class."	3.5	3.5	4	11

Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I strongly agree with the opinion that university students should be required to attend classes. There are two main reasons for this. First, without attending class, students can't get high-quality knowledge he want to get. Second, every calss has its own curriculum so absence can affect on student's learning.

 Why we go university and take lectures? It's because we want to study and learn about what we want. So every semester, we choose and register the lecture courses and participate in the coure throughout the semester. In this aspect, what will happen if student do not attend classes? A lot of things can happen, but I will talk about especially two stituations.

 First of all, students will fail to learn whole, well-organized knowledge. Let's say a male students is learning about math or physics. Althoungh he does not attend several times, maybe he could get information about terms and their concepts or some formulas he need. But, those are not complete knowledge. Rather, those are just some fragments of knowledge. We don't know what he did in his class time, but we could anticipate that he will require much more time than attending class and taking lecture to get knowledge exactly.

 Second, whatever lecture students take, it must have its curriculum and schedule. So if students optionally go to class, both student and lecturer can be affected negatively. If the lecture is kind of student-participating presentation class, it would much more worse. For lecturer, she(or he) would feel difficult to prepare every day classes and to lecture for right precess. And, for students, they can't keep up with other students in same class, so it can cause learning gap between these two group of students.

For these two reasons, I emphatically agree about university students should be required to attend classes, not optionally take the class."	3.5	3.5	3	10

742	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"  There are two opinions about the attendance of the university students' attendance. Some people believe that university students should be required to attend class. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. What should the university choose? In my opinion, university students should attend classes.
   Some people may argue that if the students know about the lecture exactly, attending classes is a waste of time. But the main purpose of the university's class is to educate students. If the classes become optional, some students may absent to class. It is a serious problem because they can miss what they should learn. Moreover, they will neglect their studies.
   You may think that students who did not attend class can get lecture notes from other students, and keep studying. Even if attendance become optional but conditions for studying is maintained, this idea has a big problem. When we attend classes, not only learn the lecture, but also get many information which is related to our future, and opportunities to communicate with other students. Students will prefer studying alone, and they will not discuss and share ideas with other students. This is not a form of creative education that we pursuit.
    Being optional for students to attend class results a big collapse and disorder. The intention of requiring  students to attend classes is not holding students or forcing them studying. It will give students diverse opportunity which cannot be realized by studying alone. So, it is needed to maintain the obligation to attend class."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
743	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Classes Should Be Optional for University Students
 In South Korea, students are required to attend classes until high school. After they graduate high school, students can freely choose whether they will go to the university or not. By the way, once they decide to go to the university and make an application for a class, they are required to attend classes and their attendance is checked. However, there are two reasons why going to classes should be optional for university students.
 Firstly, they are old enough to make decisions by themselves. Most of the students in university are adults, or they are just one or two years before being an adult. The reason why I think classes are essentially required in high school is because students need to learn not only academic knowledge but also patience to take classes they do not want to listen. Since students were forced to take classes for 12 years, they can now choose and make decision about attending classes. They are old enough to make decisions, and were forced enough in taking classes.
 Next, they can do more meaningful things in time they attend classes. Of course most of the classes are chosen by students if they will take or not, but there are still some classes in university that students must take. Students can more be more free to attend classes and do things they want to do. For example, they may participate in a research or an internship program they had an interest in. Universities would be better if students focus on what they will do in future than learning things. In other words, nowadays, students choose their job based on what they learn, but it will be better if they choose their classes based on what they want to do in the future.
 It is true that classes in universities are far loose than in high schools or in middle schools. Still, there are still forces in university classes. In conclusion, since students are old enough to make their own decisions by themselves and they can do more meaningful things in time they have to attend classes, classes should be optional for university students."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
744	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"University gives students the opportunity to choose their major, classes, and time, helping them build their independence. Although leaving the choice to attend could benefit the individuality more, I believe that class attendance should be mandatory. 
To begin with, attending the classes fully would be helpful for the students to understand the subject better and eventually help them in the future. If the university's policy became not required to attend classes, students would have to be better self-disciplined. However, that is not something everybody has especially right after high school,  putting the early stages of their university education at risk.
Secondly, the option of not attending class may lead to many absences and in return damage the class's progress. For example, many universities give team assignments that help students to become better at communicating, but many students not showing up to the class makes its worth uncertain.  
Lastly, students may miss many opportunities without knowing during their absence. For example, engaging in class and asking questions directly from the professor leads to a better understanding of the subject, but many could miss this privilege without knowing due to the optional attendance. 
Due to these reasons, I think that requiring students to attend the classes is a better option for the students."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
745	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."	"The problem of dormitory is one of the important things to university students. And, most of dormitory problems are caused by other people in dormitory rooms. Thus, it is the big issue to choose between having the university assign a student and choosing their own roommate. Although some people argue that pairing unknown roommate is better to students, my argument is that student should choose their roommate. There are three reasons in terms of stress because of uncertainty and development.
 First,  having university assign a student makes another student feel stress. There are three things that human beings should have, also known as clothes, food, and house. It means house that is place to sleep is important to human beings. So, if student's roommate is uncertain, that fact affects student's mental. All people are different. It takes many time to fit student's life pattern with their roommate for example food, language, and sleeping. Taking this time at every semester is waste of time. 
 Despite the above reason, some people said that new roommates is better because receiving new experiences is important to university students. However, university already give students new experiences through the lectures, activities, laboratories, and even clubs. Students always face with new situations. It makes students better and more creative, but this environment is quite stressful to students. Then, students should have their own place to feel comfortable and calm. That is dormitory. If students feel uncomfortable at the dorm, students' abilities will decrease.
 Because of two reasons, it is better to give the choice right to select their own roommate. University represents the freedom and responsibility. However, making forced roommate is giving students only responsibility except for freedom.  University should be the place of freedom at every areas even the dormitory."	4	4	4	12
746	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."	"    Not having conflict with roommate is an important factor for good university life. Last semester, I lived with random roommate, but now, I am living with my friend. According to my experience, I believe that university should allow students to choose their roommate.
    First reason is that it is more fun to live with my friend. For me, I am living with my friend who is joining tennis club with me. In this semester, we played tennis together a lot. Because we were roommate, it was easier to decide time to play tennis together. Not only that, since we are having similar favorites, we often watched drama or Youtube videos together. Also, we could visit a lot of famous restaurants together at any time. However, when I lived with random roommate last semester, I even did not talk to her for a whole day. Therefore, through my experience, I believe choosing roommate will help increase joy of my life.
    Second reason is that students will have more conflict with new people. Since people have diverse living pattern, living with unknown people will cause problems. For example, new roommate can be a smoker, or sleeps too late, or has bad sleeping habits. In addition, if roommate is a foreigner, it will be difficult to communicate. In my experience, I had conflict with my roommate because she sleeps too late while I sleep early. Also, she wanted to keep turning on the air conditioner while I am feeling cold. However, if we have opportunity to choose our roommate, we can ask her if she has those habits before starting to live together.
    Third reason is that when we can choose our roommate, our learning achievement will increase. Nowadays, students are having hard time finding  place to study because libraries and cafe close early due to corona virus. Therefore, a lot of students study in their dormitory room. When we can choose roommate as a person who is friendly with me, we can sometimes debate about lectures and study together. On top of that, if we have group assignment, we can solve more fast. Some people can say that if we are living with unknown people, we can study more because we won't spend time to chat. However, communicating is an effective way of learning. I strongly think that studying together is better than studying alone even I waste part of time chatting. 
    To summarize, I think choosing roommate is better than assigning roommate randomly because we can have more fun time, decrease conflicts, and increase learning achievement by choosing roommate.  Living with friend  has more advantages. I hope KAIST will keep giving oppertunittyto choose our roommate."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
747	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."	"Choosing own roommate by myself or university assignment?
 In the university, students meet many kinds of people and spend time together. Especially, we spend the most of time with a roommate, so it is a fact that the university life is mostly effected by the roommate.  Commonly, the roommate is chosen by two ways. First way is the assignment by the university, and second way is the choice by myself. Although some students want to have the university assignment for the roommate, I prefer to choose my own roommate for two reasons.
 First, me and my roommate's personalities should be matched well. As I mentioned before, university students spend the most of time with the roommates. Even if someone is so nice, there would be someone who does not go well with him or her. So, there is a possible danger that my random roommate does not go well with me if I get assigned a random roommate. For example, I prefer to eat meals alone, but my roommate can prefer to eat meals together with me. It will be an annoying situation for me. Therefore, I prefer to choose my own roommate who has a personality which goes well with my personality.
 Second, the roommate who has a similar life pattern with me is better. Of course, I can live with a roommate who has a different pattern with me. However, there can be many hard points with him. For example, if my roommate often wake up early in the morning and go study, I will hear alarm sounds every morning. Actually, it is very annoying for people like me, who wake up lately. Whereas, if my roommate has a similar pattern in wake up time or sleeping time, that kind of stress won't arise. Therefore, I would choose my own roommate who has life pattern matching with me.
 For these reasons, I have chosen my own roommates until now, and I will also choose my roommates in the future. Some people might say that they want some fun from new, random roommates. I understand their thinking too. However, in my case, the roommate is a person who spend the most time with me, so I don't want to make any possible danger to meet a not-preferred roommate."	4	4	4	12
748	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."	"I would want to choose my own roommate rather than have the university assign a student to share a room with me. 
First of the reason, There could be more stress when new student shares a room. If new student who share a room with me lives different life cycle, I would get stress and feel annoying. For example, when I was sleep, roommate plays the game or talks loudly at night. This causes me lot of stress. If we choose the roommate, I knew the roommate already before. So, there could be no conflict and no stressful problem.
Second of the reason, There could be communicate problem when new roommate is not Korean. If new roommate is not Korean, I could not speak English at all. So, when I try to communicate with roommate, it goes hard to talk and later I could not try to speak with roommate. For example, if my roommate is foreign student, I talk with my roommate little and may feel uncomfortable. Because, I feel comfortable when I could freely talk or speak with roommate.  And this communicate problem same as foreign student. So, both of me and roommate feels uncomfortable. But, if we choose a roommate, there are no uncomfortable. If I speak English well and want to foreign roommate, I choose the foreign roommate. There are no problem. Also, If I speak English not well, I choose the Korean roommate. This causes both of me and roommate feel comfortable. 
Lastly, It might be hard to be friendly with roommate if roommate is not the same age. when university have assign a student to share a room, the roommate could be the one that has more age or less age than me. If roommate age is more than me, I might treat roommate hard to be friendly. Also, if roommate age is less than me, the roommate also feels the same feeling. So, they might feel awkward each other and feel uncomfortable. 
So, because of this three reasons, there could be uncomfortable or stressful when university have assign a new student to share a room. when we could choose the roommate in own hands, we might be more comfortable and no stressful time."	3.5	3.5	3	10
749	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."	"Many students have experiences about their dormitory lives. Now, Many KAIST students live in their dormitory rooms. The dormitory rooms are the second house for them, so roommates are very important. Some people say assigning random roommates is better because they can make many friends. But I think choosing roommates have more advantage than just assigning random roommates and there are two reasons.
 First, I may feel more comfortable if I use the dormitory room with my friends. I think the most important thing when I live in a dormitory room is feeling comfortable. I know my friends well, and my friends know me well. So, It will be not uncomfortable if I live with my friends. Some people said a random roommate can be your best friend, then you can feel comfortable. But I think there is a risk. If I live with foreign roommates, communicating will be very difficult and I may feel very uncomfortable. Except to foreign roommates, I think there are many people make me uncomfortable.
 Second, I can decrease my stress about my life pattern. There are many people in university and their life patterns are different. In my case, I sleep after 12 a.m. So, if my roommates sleep before 12a.m., then it can be the stress for me. For the same reason, my roommates can have stress. And it will make their relationship worse.
 To sum up, choosing my own roommates is better because I can feel more comfortable and decrease my stress. The dormitory is a room that two or three people share and roommates are not our family. So, Thinking about roommates will be very important in dormitory life."	3.5	4	3.5	11
750	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."	"In university, there are always been controversial opinions about choosing roommate by their own is better than automatically assigning roommate by university. Of course, both sides have good points as well as bad points. However, I argue that choosing roommate method is superior than assigning method for following reasons. These reasons will be discussed separately.

 To begin with, The main benefit for choosing roommate is when we use dormitory with chosen roommate, we can not only strengthen our friendship, but also we can rely on roommate better. For example, when choosing roommate, we know each other at least a little bit, so there are much more times to be familiar with that roommate than automatically chosen roommate who has no common interest at first time. In addition, by choosing roommate with same major, we can rely on each other about assignment.

 Despite the reason above, some students argue that when university decide to take choosing roommate method, the student who don't have roommate will have a chance to assigned to strange or mad student like who get some yellow card from dormitory, and don't have roommate also. In this case, the university can give this student some advantage to choose better dormitory first like newly constructed dorm.

 Although there are pros and cons about the students need chances to choose roommate their own or the university should automatically assign roommates. I prefer choosing roommate method since we don't have to worry about the hard steps to become a friend with new roommate or we don't have to worry about problematic students either. If you are in university, it will be very nice time for you to consider which method is logically reasonable."	3.5	4	3.5	11
751	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."	"In KAIST, most of students have lived in dormitories once, and dormitories act like home for those students. And most of rooms of dormitories are for two students, so it is important to meet a good roommate at first of semester. Then how can we get a nice roommate who is fit to us? There are two ways to get a roommate; one is be assigned by the university, and the other is choose the own roommate. Both of them works well, but there are some advantages with the option which is select the own roommate.
 First, students can know roommate's life pattern, characteristics, and other information. If a roommate is assigned by the university, the only information can be get is his/her name and phone number, and there is no information about life cycle, hobby, etc. If two roommates have different life patterns, they will be stressed during the whole semester because they have different wake-up time and sleeping time. In order to reduce the stress during the semester, information about roommate is necessary, so choosing roommate is a good way than the university's roommate assignment.
 Second, choosing roommate can improve both students' ability. If we choose roommate with same major, by saying each other's weakness and improvements, and teaching how they understood their major, they can improve their understand and can grasp subjects of their major. Not only in case of same major, but also in case of same hobby can expect this improvement.
 Last, live the roommate with same hobby, you can reduce stress during the semester. Students may get enormous stress due to assignments, exams, projects, etc. You can release these stress by playing games, exercise, eating, and many ways. But if they have their time with their friends, they can release their stress more efficiently by talking with
 In conclusion, choosing roommate is better than assigned roommate with three reasons; life patterns, ability improvement, and reduce stress. Some people might say with the university assign a student, students can improve their communication power and can be adjusted in social community easily. Of course, roommate assigned by the university can be good alternative way to get own roommate, but there are many chances to communicate with many unknown people, and releasing stress is more important than communication. By select own roommate, students can have happy campus life."	4	4.5	4	12.5
752	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."	"In many universities, there are dormitories for students who don't have their own house or room nearby the university. Especially, for example, in KAIST, most of the students is living in dormitory rooms, because there are no appropriate rooms or home to live nearby university. So many students live in dormitory rooms and spend many times with their roommate. As a result, their roommate can be important factor which can give great effects on university life. So I prefer choosing my own roommate rather than university assigning. There are many reasons.

  First at all, because of random property of assigning, you can encounter the roommate who have relationship problem with you. For example, When I was in high-school, which has dormitory rooms, I've watched a student who had been randomly-assigned with the student who have been fought with once as his roommate. During the semester, he couldn't be familiar with his roommates, and the awkward situation had been continued. Although dormitory rooms are the place that we can be comfortable, they couldn't be comfortable because of themselves. 

  Secondly, sometimes, it is difficult to be familiar with randomly-assigned roommate's routines. In university, differently with high-school or middle-school life, each student's life routines are so much different according to their semesters and major. For example, the students who have computer science or designing major usually encounter many team-project assignments. And because of classes, most of team-project agenda and works are proceeded in night. In this case, your sleeping can be disturbed by your computer science major roommate's agenda. Also, let's consider the situation that you're in graduation semester and your roommate is a freshman. Your roommate must be busy at midnight because of many meetings with friends. These differences of routines can disturb each one's sleeping and even life. 
 
  Finally, choosing own roommate is more rational methods than assigning randomly. If you don't have any friends, you are not affected by methods about assigning roommates. Because you have to be randomly assigned with other remained students. That's same result when we are assigned randomly at first. But if we can choose our own roommates, there would be many students matched with wished roommate.

  In conclusion, I'd like to choose my own roommate, rather than be assigned randomly, because of relationship problems, difference of routines, and method's rationality. Also, I wish everyone can choose your soulmate as roommate in next semester and enjoy more comfortable university life."	3.5	3.5	3	10
753	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."	"Do you have any experience with live in the dormitory? In our school, KAIST, almost all of the students live in the dormitory and most of the dormitory, two students are sharing the room. Furthermore, there are two options in our school to choose the roommate, random or choosing our own. Which one is better choice? Some people think the method that assigning roommate by university is better way, but I rather choose my own roommate. There are following three reasons for supporting my opinion. 

First, people have their own life style. In KAIST, there are many different life style with sleeping time, wake-up time, each time table, and else. If we met a random roommate with different life style, we will feel uncomfortable and sleepy. For example, I sleep at very late time like 5am, but if my roommate sleep at 10pm and wake up at 6am, I and my roommate will very uncomfortable both. For this reason, it is good to find a roommate with similar life style. 

Secondly, familiar friend will helpful to make some rule for living together. In my case, I feel hard to make a new deep relationship with others, and I can't talk my feel or opinion to unfamiliar person. For this, if I get random roommate, I wouldn't talk the point of improvement to living together. As a result, I would feel upset to live in the dormitory. Not only me, but most of people would similar to me. Thus, I think I need to live with my close friend. 

Although there are ample supporting opinions for choosing roommate is better method, many people think it is better that university assign a roommate because of meeting various people. However, as I mentioned above, I couldn't make a new close relationship quickly. In addition, I think the quality of life is more important than make a new friend. Therefore, I prefer to choose my own roommate who are similar and familiar with me. 

To sum up, I think choosing the roommate theirselves is better idea with three reasons above. For a happy campus life, life in dormitory is also important. So I think the roommate is one of important part of college life. For this, in my opinion, it is good to find a roommate for our own in college for enjoying the happy campus life."	3.5	4	3.5	11
754	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."	"There are many university which have dormitory for school, also the KAIST. Since that dormitory room has to be cheap, because it is for students, most of dormitory must be shared by two or more students. There are two way to group students, which are 'assigned by university', as known as 'random roommate', or 'choose own roommate'. Some people argue that random roommate is better, but I believe that choosing own roommate is better for students, for following reasons.
 First, which is the most important one, is that random roommate can cause serious trouble. The dormitory is the house for students. They study, rest, wash and sleep in dormitory. Therefore, students in room have to be have similar life style to avoid trouble, but school can not group every students properly. Despite that student check their life habit like sleeping or smoking, there are always trouble between random roommate. For example, some student play game with voice chatting at night. The roommate trouble is the most stressful, since roommate is the person who have the most time together with. If students choose their own roommate, the roommate trouble is not going to happen.  
 Next, choosing own roommate can help students to reduce stress. When students choose their roommate, they select friend who have same hobby with them, like play game or listen to music. While sharing hobby with roommate, it can help them to reduce stress. 
 Despite the reason above, some people argue that random roommate is better, since it can be a chance to make a new 
friend. However, it is not a good chance to make a friend, since similar habit and hobby is needed to be a friend. During university life, there are more and more chance to make friends. For example, club activity and laboratory. So merit of making a friend is smaller than risk of trouble. 
 In conclusion, there were three points why choosing own roommate is better than random roommate. The random roommates cause trouble, choosing own roommate can help to reduce stress, and refute to chance of being friend with random roommate. With these reasons, I suggest that students have to choose their own roommate, since this is better for students."	4	4	4	12
755	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."	"How can we choose our dormitory roommates?

 In KAIST, the undergraduate students all have to enter their own dormitories during semester. Someone had already lived in dormitory in high school, but for all KAIST students have a chance to live in dormitory. If we would like to apply the dormitory, we first have to choose the building, and ""roommate"". If we're a freshman, we don't have to worry about this, because school assigned our roommates. On the other hand, we must choose our roommates if we are over second grades. And, there are some opinions about this case. In my opinion, I prefer choosing our roommates, and I suggest three reasons to support my thought.

 First, we can avoid an awkward mood with our roommates because we already knew them. Especially, if there is a best friend who graduated a same high school, then he can be a great candidate for our roommate. 
 Secondly, we can prevent the complaint due to a disagreement of life cycle pattern. For example, if we usually do our homework in late night and roommates sleep at midnight, then he would be interrupted on sleeping by us. This would make a small anger, which can be developed a big problem. However, if we choose our partners directly, we can investigate some careful habits of them. As a result, we won't have to the right to complain the dormitory about roommate, comparing to random assign.
 Lastly, we can reduce our time to think of our next roommates. If school always assigns our post-roommates, then we have to worry. We already spent our time solving several matters and adapting our new dormitory lives, but it has been reset and return to the starting point again. So, choosing our roommates can resolve this problem easily.
 Despite of this advantages, someone says that this solution also gives some bad effects, such as the reduction of  life's diversity in dormitory. But, we can solve this problem by policy in our dormitory, KAIST.

 In conclusion, I'd like to insist that it is better for us to choose our roommates directly, because we don't need to experience an awkward situation with our roommates, and we can save our time."	4	4	4	12
756	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."	"School dormitary is the place where university students that don't know much about each other meet. They share their time and space for long time, at least one semester.  Since this is quite a long time, we can see that rooms are assigned in various ways in the dormitory. For example, some people live with the friends that they already know, and other people live with unknown, random people. There can be both advantages and disadvantages on each way, but I think it's better for university to assign students to share a room with.

First of all, Students can get more opportunities to meet people and to build their relationship. There are various people in college, but the people students meet in their daily lives will be limited to students from the same department and club. However, if the school allocates dormitories, students in more diverse fields and situations will be able to meet. These factors can be seen as providing college students with a wider range of choices. For example, two students from different departments who first met can share common interests and build relationships. Due to the nature of KAIST, even if they belong to other departments, they can participate in researches or competitions together in the future. If they use a room with an existing friend, it will not be easy to get this new opportunity.

The second reason for dormitary allocation of university is that students can improve their own social skills. Since humans are social animals, interaction with others is inevitable in life. While human meets various people, they develop social skills and establish self-esteem. From this point of view, random arrangement of dormitories in schools can be considered as a means to provide more diverse opportunities to students. Learning how to get along with other people in an essential space in daily life will be of great help in improving students' communication skills. For instance, If we meet older or younger people in the dormitory, the communication skills we should have at this time will be different from those we have when living with friends. In this case, we can fully learn and understand the required skills during the semester.

Also, there is reason for universities, the efficiency. In the case of random arrangement, the school will collectively implement and notify, and then students can exchange rooms if necessary. For this case, communication between the school and the students can be done in both directions, and communication between students is also made only when necessary, so the method is simple. However, if they choose arbitrarily among themselves, communication will be complicated and it will take more time because an agreement must be reached between all students in advance. In addition, the opportunities for communication between the school and the students are reduced, so additional efforts are required for communication.

In conclusion, there are three main reasons for dormitary assignment for students by universtiy. Eventhough there can be some reasons that students' choice are prefered, I think university have to assign students to share a room with for both students and university. Maybe you can try it for a semester to meet special people that can fullfill your weaknesses"	4	4	4	12

Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."	"In our university, dormitory rooms must be shared by two students. In this situation, the biggest argument is that how to match roommates. There are two systems which are widely used in universities. The first is that university assigns students randomly, while the second one is that students choose their own roommate. In my opinion, it is better to adopt the second one.
At First, it is important to have a roommate who has similar living patterns. Assume there is a student A, who sleeps at 11pm, while his or her roommate B sleeps at 1am. Student B wants to study at night, while student A wants to sleep. Similarly, student A wants to eat lunch while student B is watching a class lecture video. Although it is impossible to match students who have perfectly same patterns, students who has similar living patterns with roommate will be more comfortable.
Secondly, there is a possibility that two students who hate each other become roommates. It is a serious problem because they have to meet all the time, even if they do not want to. This can cause serious mental problem to students.
Some people can argue that there would be students who cannot find his or her roommate. But there are many solutions. University can make a community that students can upload their own information, living patterns. Students who couldn't find the roommate will be matched. If there are students who were not matched, university can adopt the random system partially.
As I mentioned before, the way university assigns students randomly will cause many problems. Many students will suffer from roommates who have different living patterns. Also, a person cannot be friendly to all the others. If there is a bad relationship between roommates, they can be stressed. By students choosing their own roommate, these problems can be solved."	4	4	3.5	11.5

Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."	"Choosing Own Roommates Should be Allowed
In our society, there are many controversial probelms that are not solved. The problem for choosing a roommate is one issue among them. Some people say that the university should assign a roommate to share a room with a student, but others say that the student should choose his/her own roommate. Between two ideas, I strongly think that the student should be able to choose his/her own roommate.

First of all, it is easy for students to settle well in their dormitory with the roommates they chose. For some students, it may be a hard task to get along and live with their roommate if they are new face to each other in case the university chose the roommates. If two students become a roommate, they spend a long time together. However, it will be hard for weeks or months if they don't know each other well. It will be better to settle if the roommates were familiar to each other.

Next, it is better for students to live with a roommate who has a similar life style with them. Roommates share one room. It means, if one makes a sound, their roommate is able to hear it. If the roommates have a different life style, a problem occurs. For example, let's think of one possible case that student A sleeps at eleven o'clock at night but his/her roommate B sleeps later. If A tries to sleep and turns of the light, B can be distracted if they had an assignment or a study left to do. If they had a similar sleeping time and life style, this will be solved.

Still, some people say that their might be some students who don't have a roommate if students choose roommates by their own. In this case, dormitory teachers can gather all students who still couldn't find their roommate and help them to choose their roommate. They can tell their life style or things they want for their roommate, and pair up if they want. This way, every students will be able to have a roommate.

To summarize, students should be able to choose their roommate for the reasons I stated above. It will make better dormitory life for students if universities and society allow them to choose their roommates."	4	4	4	12
759	"You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."	"In a campus life, where we stay far from our family and friends, the question of whether to choose your roommate is crucial. Although some people may prefer to have a random student as their roommate, students should have the freedom to choose their own roommate considering their convenience and fun. 
To begin with, staying with someone we know is more convenient than sharing a room with an unfamiliar person. In our bustling university life, full of struggles and challenges, we would not want any more complicated situation at least in our dorm room. Therefore, we should be comfortable with our roommate and thus we need the opportunity to choose. Moreover, if we share a room with our friends, we may receive the comfort and support we need during our hardships.
Secondly, choosing our roommate with purpose can lead to a fun life on campus. Everyone has their own preference and hobbies. If we select our roommates based on our similar tastes in music, favorite food, or hobby, we would have a higher chance to match with them. We will have more topics to have a conversation about and more activities to do together. Moreover, for some people, the roommate's age may affect whether they can be comfortable throughout the stay. In such cases, the university assigning a roommate limits the option. 
Regardless of these supporting statements in favor of choosing our own roommates, others might contend otherwise. They may think that meeting new people will help students improve their social skills. However, we will have enough chances to improve our social skills during classes since professors focus on communication and teamwork nowadays. 
In summary, students should have the chance to choose their roommates because they will be more comfortable with them. Although having an unfamiliar roommate may sound fun, it has risks to be otherwise. Therefore, I hope you choose. your roommate wisely for your own better life on campus."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
760	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I prefer to study together for two reasons. First, classmates would encourage me when I want to give up and rest. Last year, I did a group study for general physics course. However, because I made my appointments, I could stick to my homework and make it.
The other reason is that one can be more creative. When I face a difficult problem, I can get a hint from others. By sharing various opinions and perspectives, one can get an wide angle of thinking. I studied more effectively when I did together.
I respect students who study alone as well. But from my experience, It is better to study with other students."	1	1	1.5	3.5
761	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	" I prefer to study alone. Because it is more efficient way for me.
There are several reasons why I think it is more efficient.
First, when you study with other people, you got to meet people. Which means that you have to have at least some of the conversations with your friends. And this can lead to some problems like having unnesessary conversations for too long time, or getting upset by other people.
Second, it consumes more time than studying alone. Let's say that you got a study meeting. Then you have to go some place to study. Changing places consumes not only your energy, but also your precious time.
Third, I believe that the advantages I can get from a group studying can be simulated in a self studying. I think the first big advantage from a group studying is questioning and answering. But you can make your own questions using your textbook. In more detail, textbooks highlight the points that you must learn from certain chapter and you can make your own questions and answer based on that. And next big advantage is speaking which can be simulated by reading aloud. I believe that speaking itself has great advanteage for learning because it stimulates our brain. So I think that altough it is not the same experience, we can get similar advantages from reading aloud or explaining to a doll.
For the above reasons, I think it is more efficient to study alone. 
But I am not saying that a group studying is worse than a self studying. A group studying has other advantages other than the aboves. Like, you can learn how to interact with a real person. Or maybe they can teach or ask you that you never have thought about. 
So I think to choose wisely depending on the situation is critical. There is some situations that efficiency is really important. For example, when you are cramming for a test. In fact, I deal with this kinds of situations usually, so I usually prefer to study alone. But I try a group study time to time other than such situations to get its advantages."	2.5	2	2	6.5
762	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"There are so many ways to study something. But if we categorize them with the number of study group members, we can find that there are two main branches; studying alone and studying with other people. Both have their own advantages. So we cannot choose the absolute winner. In my case, I prefer to study with other people. There are two major reasons; various thoughts and stimulation. 
First, studying with other people can provide me the opportunity to get some thoughts that I cannot make easily. Although this advantage cannot be found at a group study in a silent atmosphere, I think the trade of various opinions like a forum of ancient Greek people is the best advantage of studying with other people. The thoughts can be some background knowledge such as the contents of previous studies of one group member. Or an opinion about some historical events can be a kind of 'various thoughts'. The access in the various aspects or points of view makes my learning not only more abundant but also more objective. By doing group study, I can reduce some biases in my knowledge. 
Second, studying with other people make me more passionate.  I especially get stimulated when seeing very passionate people. If I can study with such people, I can study more effectively. Some people think that there should be a silent place to study. But I think studying in such a place can make me sleep. Passionate environment is the best.\"	2.5	2	3.5	8

" When the midterm exam is coming, students start to study for the test. Some students study at their dormitory room while others study as a group. In my opinion, I prefer to study alone. Based on my knowledge and experience, I think I can focus more on study and save more time when I study alone.
 First of all, I can spend my entire mind on study. This is because I can't get pay attention to the study if there are others around me. There are many ways which disrupt me but specifically, having a conversation and the nosiy that others make are the most. In my experience, it was always unstoppable to talk with others when we study as a group. No matter whether the subject of our conversation is related to the study or not, if the conversation begins, it disrupts my studying tempo. I always make plan when I study and I try to finish it. However, when the conversation begins, I don't know when it stops. So I have to whether study more than I planned or do it later to finish the tasks that I planned to do. The noisy that others make is also unneglegible. My ear is little bit sensitive to the sound so I always put on ear plugs when I go to bed earlier than my roommate. Walking, breathing, dropping pen, all the little sound cuts the rhythem of my studying tempo. So it is better to study alone if I want to focus more on the study.
 Next, I can study with a longer time if I study alone. This is because I can save extra time such as walking, or dressing. This extra time seems small but when we gather all of them, we can't ignore that. Imagine that you are going meet my friends at the library for a study. Then, you have to wear some clothes, take some shower, go outside, get a taxi(if you choose walking or taking a bus, it will spend more), and meet friends at the library. It can take a longer time if there is no sits available at the library. However, if you decided to study alone in my room, you don't have to do all of the above. In addition, we don't study for just a one day. Simply saving 30 minutes per a day, we can save 7hours per 2 weeks. It is a lot of time. 
 These are the reasons why I prefer to study alone. I can pay more attention to the study and spend longer time on study. Studying is basically understanding by myself. It would be good to discuss questions that I don't know, but questions comes after the study and after reading the books. I spend more time on understanding the information rather than asking some questions, so I prefer to study alone"	3.5	3.5	3	10
764	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I prefer to study alone.
   I prefer study alone. When I study in library with little music without any trouble, I can do my best for study. There are many reasons which I like to study alone. I will talk about 3 reasons why I like to study alone. 

 First, study alone makes me pay attention to the study. For example, when I study with my friend in high school, we have a talk more than 2 hours. Because of that, I can't study about test well. All of humans don't like to study, so almost all of people try to do something others. For instance, some people says ""cleaning is fun when I have to study hard"". It means when we have to study hard, we should eliminate 'something'. But when we study with friends, we always can talk very well. So I think study alone is better than study with a group of students.
 Second, we can study alone always. We have to make times to styudy with a group of students. It means you have to change some schedule to study with group. But when you study alone, you can study always. You can study in 3:00 a.m. or 9:00 a.m. such like that, which many students don't study . Especially, you can study the between class and class. I think in this time, you can't make study groups because all of students have different schedule.
  Third, study with other students make quit study faster. I think all of you guys have experience about this. When you study with a friend, and when the friend say have to go. Then almost all of you quit the study earlier than you thought. It means study with groups make short study time than study alone. Of course when your friends study harder than you, you don't affect with this. But it means your friend affect with this.
  Of course, there are some good points to study with a group of students. But I think study alone makes you can study harder, longer than study with a group. I want you to study alone especially when you don't have enough days before the test. Study with friends are happier than study alone. It means you don't study well then alone. "	2.5	2	2	6.5

    There are many students who prefer to study with a group of students. It's popular way to study hard, but also some students don't prefer to study with others.  It's hard to say which way is much better. However, I prefer to study with group because of two benefits. This essay will talk about why I prefer to study with a group of students.

    First, Study with group help students to share their knowledge. Group studying can help students to teach them each other. If someone confused how to solve problem, may be other student can help. They can share their knowledge, and it makes their group can get a good grade in exam. Also, students can share information about exam. Group can have more information than students who don't have group, and it makes group can prepare exam condition.

    Second, Study with group makes them work hard. Sometimes, study makes student get tired. Even though they have important exam, they can't work hard without passion. Group students can help each other overcome tireness. Then, they can work hard for a long time and it makes a good result in exam. In addition, someone who doesn't work hard in group will be excepted. If he want to get benefit of group studying, he should keep work hard. It will be connected to good results in exam.

    In conclusion, Studying with group have two benefits. First, studying with group makes them share knowledge. For example, they can share how to solve specific type of problem, or the concepts of exam. Second, group studying make them keeping work hard. They can cheer up each other. Also, they should work hard for keep one sheet of group. For these reasons, I prefer to study with a group and I want to many people study"	2.5	3	2.5	8

"It was common to go to the quiet library for studying, 10 years ago. However, these days, many students go to the cafe to study, which was considered as unefficient and should prohibited last days. People have different characteristic, and so that have different perference regarding the studying method, whether study alone or with other students. For me, I prefer study with other students. In this essay, I will present why I prefer studying as a group in two aspect; concentration and memorization.
     To begin with, many people in early days thought that if they sat on the desk longer, than they get higher score. By the large, they didn't consider efficiency of studying. Because of that, most of parents gave their children applaude when they had sat on the desk for a long time. However, studying for a long time and getting a better score is not the same. It is easy to lost concentration when we study. And in this circumstance, what can help with increasing concentration is other people. For example, many students said that they are going to the academy to study. Their friends, whom in the academy, give them an impetus for studying in many different ways. Friencds made them willing to get higher score than their friends or study because there is nothing to do except studying. I studied very hard when I was a high school student to get better grade than my friends. The existance of friends made studying competive and my concentration was increased.
     Moreover, studying with friends made students to use more senses. Generally speaking, it helps students to memorize. Students study alone usually use smaller senses rather than those who study as a group. While studying as a group, they ask each other that they didn't catch up in the classroom and made a question to evaluate their understanding. When doing this, they uses sounds which is hard to use when studying alone. For instance, I studied with my friend and asked each other a biology questions to check our understanding of lecture. I wasn't able to memorize the whole section dealed in the classroom solely and thought it is impossible to memorize the whole chapter, however, after I began study with my friend, I started to memorize the biology thing that I have to fastly. And eventually I got good grade in biology in that semester.
     To sum up, because studying as a group help people to increase the efficiency and concentration and memorize the things that they have to, I prefer to study as a member of group. However, I think my studying method is not perfect, so that I have to research studying method that fit on me."	4	3.5	3.5	11
767	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Some people prefer to study alone because they do not have to fit their schedules in group members' schedules and they can take a rest when they want. However, I think  studying with other students is better for two reasons.

The first reason is that students who study with group members can earn lots of knowledges  which they are not in major. When I was in the high school, I studied with my friends to get good grade in final exam. I was good at physics and math, but I did not have any deeply knowledge in chemistry, and biology. On the other hand, one of our group members was good at chemistry, and another group member was good at biology. Therefore, we divided the group study time into 2 parts. In the first time, we studied our major subject to make other group members understand easily. Then, we stduied other subject and ask questions to other group member who is in major that subject. Through this group studying, I earned lots of knowledges in chemistry and biology, and I got the best grade in these subjects.

The second reason is that students can make good relationship with their group members. When student study alone, they might feel lonely and difficulty to make new friends. Meanwhile, when students make therir own study group and study with group members many times, they should know deeply each other and can make friendship with them easily. In my case, I was very shy, so I did not make a new friend easily when I was in middle school. However, I joined the study group in the highschool, and my group members help me to make friends. They call me when they play their classmates. Thanks to them, I usually meet my same highschool friends when I want to play with them. In addition, group study help students when they go to college. There are lots of group activities in almost whole class in college, so experience of group study help students to make friends and participate in group project easily.

With group study, students can earn ohter majors knowledges deeply and make good relationship with other people. Therefore, I prefer to study with group members."	3	3	3	9

"Since  I am currently an online student who have to stay at home and study alone in front of my computer. From my experience,  I prefer to study with a group of students. There are three supporting reasons: studying with friends can give me motivation, socializing, and knowledge. 
             First, studying with friends motivates me to be active and to focus on the lessons. When I study alone, everything relies on me. So, I spend most of the time for playing games and watching some videos on Youtube. The result was that I could not do well in the exam. In contrast, when I study with a group of friends, I feel powered up by people surrouding me. They are reading books, doing homework and other academic activities. To sum up, studying with friends motivates me to spend time effectively on studying.
             Next,  I can socialize with my friends. In my opinion, studying with a group of students does not have a good benefit related to academic only, but it gives us a chance to meet with new people and we can share some interesting topics and activities. So, we can learn and explore something that we have never learned or done before.
            Last, studying with friends is an oppotunity to help each other in learning. Sometimes, I have a question in the class, but I am not confident to ask a teacher/professor a question.  So, I keep that question and ask to one of my friends who is good at that subjects. The next example is when the exam is coming, me and my friends will assemble and teach each other depending on which subject you are good at. I am good at Biology, therefore, I can teach them and answer questions that they asked. 
           In conclusion, studying with a group of students can guide me how to improve my understanding and personality. I can be more active person. Also I can learn many things from other students. Therefore, in my perspective, I prefer to study with a group of people."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

I prefer to study with a group of students. Even though some people like to study alone because it can make us concentrate on the work that we have to do, it looks like the work that will not help us to evolve in academic way.
I agree with the idea that studying with a group of students for 3 reasons. It is win-win, friendship and teaching skills.
 Firstly, i agree with the idea above because it can give advantages to all students in the group. According to my experience, students have various advantages and  different subjects that they are good at. However, our ultimate goal is to recognize and learn all the subjects that teachers teach us. And one thing that they can do is teaching each other. Even though we have to use our precious time to teach other students in thier group, we can get knowledge from others without using money or finding new teacher that fit us. I think it is one of the important reason that i think group study is much better.
 Secondly, one of the important thing that we have to achieve in middle, high school and even university is friendship. This is beacause it can be huge advantage and power when we grow up and i think that studying with students would be one of the most fine way to make good friends. For example, I made study group when i was in high-school. Because we had to study hard in high-school, I guess that the time that i saw my study group members will be much longer than the time that i see my parents in my house. For these, I think group studying has advantage in this part too.
 Lastly, i think learning skills to teach others is important thing that will be widely used in our life. According to my cousin who work for electronic company, he has to teach other people who are freshman to the company. And he has big problem with this work because he hasn't teach others. Since the era that my cousin studied in high school and university is old and there was no one that made group and study with each other. Furthermore, I did private teaching this semester. But it was very hard because i didn't teach others many time. So, it would be worthful if we have habit to teach others and study in group."	2.5	2.5	2	7

"I always study alone rather than with other friends.  I will tell my story, which made me never study with a group. When I was in high school, I went to a room with my friends, where the high school made it ready for those who want to study in groups. I thought it would be very productive. The room had everything required to study, and, of course, I had friends to ask of anything I wouldn't understand. However, there were some problems. 
 At first, the fact that I am with my friends makes me want to play with them. I It was very easy to lose my concentration and to start chat with my friends. When the time I assigned for group study (at that time, it was about 6 hours) is up, what I did during the time was just few sheets of paper. That amount of paper could have been done within 1 to 2 hours if I had studied alone. I realized from my experiecne that it is exteremely inefficient when studying with friends.
 Some might say my failure at that time is because those in groups are  ""friends"". Those who are familiar with and are in very comfortable relationships. Then, what about next story? After entering into KAIST, I had another opportunity to have study-groups. I hesiated at first, but in this case as there were no aquaintance at all, it wouldn't be any problems. I thought I could study without any distraction. Unfortunately, it was not true again. It seemed good at first, but as the time went by, I became familiar with them and became friends. As you may expect, the result was not that satisfactory.
 To sum up with, I realized ,through these two experiences, my failure in group studying is due to the fact that it is very distracting for me when I realize there are friends around me, and my concentration moves from my study to anything else. I am sure there are others whose efficiency goes up when studying in groups, but what matters is that I am not one of those. This is why I prefer to study alone."	3	3	3	9
771	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"When I study something,  I usually prefer to study alone. There are three reasons.

  First, I can concentrate more when I study alone than study with other students. If I study with other students, they would talk about some problems, or some gossips, and even make noises. It makes me do not concentrate in my work. In addition, if someone takes some rest like playing game, or taking nap, then I'd like to do it,too. It's never helpful to concentrate.

  Second, I can control my condition and pace when I study alone. Imagine that some students are studying same things with me and each student's  studying speed is different with me. If it is too faster than me,  I would think that I should study more rapidly. Then, I might forget something important, or get lower accuracy. If it is too slower than me, I would think that I'm studying fast, and I can get some rest, because others are too slower than me. Either of those situations are not helpful.

  Last, studying alone is more efficient. If I study with other students, I should go some place like cafe or library, which enables many students to study with. The environment in there, like tables, chairs, Wifi, might be incomfortable for me and it might require some money. Although it is comfortable space, I should adapt to its own system. Therefore, whether it is comfortable or not, it's better to study in my house or dorm, which is most familiar place for me.

  For these three reasons, I'd like to study alone. Thank you for reading long text, and have a nice day!"	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
772	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"study with group. From my experience, I prefer to study with group of students. There are three reasons to support my idea.
 First, we can ask each other what we don’t understand well by studying with a group. When I was high school student, I am poor at biology, however, one of my friend is very good at it. And, I am good at math, but my friend isn’t. As we can not good at all kinds of field, I and my friend studied together. So we could ask each other and got to know better what we are not good at. Finally, at that exam, we got satisfying result in both biology and math. In such way, studying with a group is very helpful to ask and understand better.
 Second, speaking with other people is a good way to memorize something. We have too many things to memorize while studying. And there is a research result that speaking is a better way to memorize. Even though we can speak alone, speaking to others about the things what we learn is certainly a good way to study because speaking to other is less boring than speaking alone. Thus, by speaking with other, we can study better as well as memorizing better.
 And last, we can be stimulated by watching other people studying, so can be more focused on. There is an old saying, “a dog in academy for three years can even speak well.” It means even if you are just close to other people that studying very well, you can resemble him or her. Like the saying, if you are with the people who are studying hard, you would be stimulated and think that you should study. And then you will also study hard. Finally, you will get good result. So studying with other people can be helpful to be motivated.
 In conclusion, I presented three reasons; we can ask each other what we don’t understand well, speaking with other people is a good way to memorize something, we can be motivated by watching other people studying. For these three reasons, I prefer to study with group of students. If you agree with my idea, why don’t you studying with a group next time? Thank you for reading."	2.5	2	2	6.5
773	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Learning and enhancing my knowledge is up to me, but studying environment doesn't have to be alone. I think studying with a group of students is more efficient.
 The first reason is that studying with friends can be a good motive to each other. Watching my friend studying hard can make me more concentrated and motivated. While studying alone can make me get loose and not focused, With people who can concentrate and focus only on studying makes me more efficient. Friends can help about my mental problem when I got stuck and need help.
 The second reason is that the more people is in that group, the faster I can solve some problem which I don't know. In groups, people can communicate lot about the concept which they are learning and can ask questions. Even answering about other person's question can be helpful to our learning, too. At high school, in my club there was a lot of study groups and study trades. I learned many things from friends and seniors, and also taught about math and physics to members who need help. One man can't be good at every subject and can miss some part of a concept. Friends who can help that problem can be very time-saving and helpful. Perhaps someone can say great teacher is enough to higher your grade, but a friend who is learning same thing with you will have much similar point of view and might have had a same problem you are having. In that case that friend can be the best teacher.
  Final reason is group studying makes me study even I don't want to. when I have a group study on that day, it's not possible to me to absent that group study just because I'm tired or I don't want to. Because no one's watching and studying with you, studying alone makes me tired and wants to quit even though you started with strong emphathy. The small fact that someone is with you can upper your strength about studying. That's why most people prefer studying at study room to at house. Studying will be a long-term work for most of us and study with your friends to study long.
  Studying  process don't have to be alone. Your group member can be the best teacher, friend and emphasizer. "	3	2.5	2.5	8

"There are many cases and situations for studying. It is really interesting to see how student's are studying, because of its variety. Some students prefer to study alone, others prefer to study with a group of students. What I want to say is there are so many ways to study. Now I will write about what I prefer. In my case, I prefer to study with many friends. I am going to give you reasons.

 First, While I study with other students, I can give some tips, also I can get some tips. For example, if I have some problems that is really hard for me, at that case there are helpers who can suggest great tips or ideas near to me. Or, We can have some time to deeply think about that question. It can be very efficient because we can remember that hard question for a long time. This kind of conversation can make both me and other students grow and become better.

 Second, We can give a motivation and assist for studying. Let's think about studying math, science, and etc which are really hard and tired to learn. But, if you have learning mate next to you, it can be cheerful to each other. For instance, you are so tired and you think you are going to sleep for a moment. Then, you can just tell to him/her who is next to you. Also, we have a chance to talk about 'The reason why we study?' After that talk, we will get some power and energy to study.

 Lastly, There are some students who say that quiet place is the best, so they are studying alone at quiet place such as home or study cafe. However, we have to think about examination environment. When we take exam, there are so many people in the classroom and they will make some sounds. So, we have to get time to adapt that environment where many people stay with me.

 In conclusion, If you study with others, you can get positive effects from others such as tips, motivation. In addition to this, you have some time to adapt environment where you should make your best effort. For these reasons, I think it is much better to study with other people than to study alone.

" All students have their own studying methods and skills. Some students  like studying alone better, and other students like studying together with their friends much more. Each method has their own advantages, but In my case, i like studying  by making teams more. There are three reasons for it.
   First reason is that i can learn what i didn't know from  people whom i'm studying with. Although i listened the class carefully and study hard alone, something that i don't know or understand exists. When we study toghether, there is a probability that someone knows this. 
   Second reason is that i can get the mind of improvement.  When i study alone, i do not study hard. Because there is  no other people who are studying around me. So i don't want to study either and play with phone. However, when i study with a grop of students, there are many people who are studying around me. Therfore, i aslo begin to study too.  Aslo i have Desire to get better grades than other people, so seeing other peolple studying is good motivate to me.   
   At last, by teaching other study memebers, i can understand more correctly.  Not only be taught from other study members, but also teaching  other students  is a good way to study.  When i teach other people, i can organize our knowledge that i am going to say .  if i do this, i can remember the knowledge for long period of time than before. furethermore, i can realize my weak part when i teach the whole part i know.  
  To summarize, because i can learn new knowledge, inspire to study hard and reviw my knowledge i prefer study with a grop of studnents more.  "	2.5	2	1	5.5
776	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I prefer to study with a group of students. While I study alone, mostly the studying environment is very quiet. No one can bother me while I memorize what I have learned in the lecture, or do my homeworks. This means that I can concentrate more on my study. 
   But while I study with my friends, I can ask them about the problems that I don't know the exact reason or answer. We can debate about it. During the debate, I can hear my friends' opinions, which contain things that I don't know well. Or I can have a new point of view. Plus, I have to use the things I learned to make an opinion. I have to remember about the lecture contents, mix them logically into an opinion to tell my friends that I'm right. This not only leads me to new knowledge and more interest, but it also makes what I have learned into a long-term memory.
    For example, when I was in highschool, we had a biology test. There were so many scientific words and theories about our body and nature. I had questions about ETC(Electron Transferring Chain) - things like how the proteins move the electrons, what molecular structure they had. Of course I read Campbell(biology textbook) again and again, only to check what I already know. I asked this to my friends in biology seminar. We used more textbooks that we had privately, debated it for an hour, and made conclusions. Though I forgot several things in biology, I clearly remember about this topic and what I have learned. 
    In conclusion, both ways of studying are useful in memorizing contents. But if I study alone, there must be something that I don't know exactly. And I can't solve this problem alone. On the other hand, if I study with a group of students, I can learn more about the contents by listening to other people's opinions. I can also ask and check that what I know is right. That is why I prefer to study with a group of students."	2.5	2.5	3	8
777	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Do you prefer to study alone or with a group? It might depend on what you study. However, usually, I prefer studying alone. Here are some reasons.

First, you can keep your own pace. No one will make you go slower or faster. If you want, you can have some rest, too. You can dive into the subject that you are interested in and explore deeper and deeper as you want. It's totally up to you. When I was in highschool, I studied biology with my friends. Since I was not good at biology, I needed to slow down to understand. This made my friends study slower and I was so sorry to them. Therefore studying alone is good to you and your friends.

Next, although you decided to make a study group, it's hard to meet each other. You have to decide when and where to meet. However, if you study alone you can do it anywhere whenever you want. This means you don't have to waste time to be prepared to study.

Studying together won't make best condition for you to study. Each people has unique studying habits. Some would listen to music while solving math problems and others would walk around memorizing words. For me, I read out the book to focus on what I'm reading, which will absolutely disturb others studying. To be in best condition to study, you have to be alone.

"There's many kinds of people in world. So there will be many kinds of methods of  studying that they prefer . Some maybe like to study alone at home , library or cafe. Others maybe like to study with groups.  
I prefer to study alone, instead of group studying. I have experienced both of them. It's true that there are advantages when studying with other students. We can ask what we don't know quickly and studying would be less boring. But when I studied alone,  I felt I concentrated  more than studying with group.  I don't like situation that people are next to me when I am doing something hard. They make me feel not so good.  When studying alone, there are no people around me, so I  do not have to think about other things during studying.

Also , second reason I prefer studying alone is that I can go to eat, or take a rest whenever  I want. When studying with others, there's a possiblity that they suggest me to take a lunch or ask me something , even though I did not finish studying and I am trying hard solving problems.   That's very annoying . But I don't have to experience such situation when I am alone. 

For these reasons , I  don't like to study with group and I prefer to study alone. When I am alone, I can make a best result.  "	2.5	2	1.5	6
779	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Even now, many people buy lotteries and hope to win them. They believe that it is the easiest way to succeed. In spite of the belief, success does not live in a casino thus not come from taking risks or chances. God does not play dices. Instead, if one wants to grasp success, he or she should find another way to succeed; that is, careful planning.
    First, some people say that they are miserable and hopeless, so they can never succeed without fortunes. But success does not follow money; It follows an achievement. No one say that winning a lottery is an achievement. To achieve something, one need to make a plan and stick to the plan. It takes time and sweat. One might take risks and fortunately win money, but it would never give any sense of success.
    Having plans, in addition, make the success not to go away. One important property of success is continuity; it must not vanish. Success from careful planning never disappears but rather keeps growing. Once he or she achieved one plan, one can take the successful results into the count and make a new plan.  On the other hand, one who choose to take risks can lose everything in any moment. It is not success; it is just a dream. To maintain the success, making plan is necessary.
    Furthermore, having plans reduces the uncertainty and helps people to deal with unexpected situation. With clear goals, one can visualize their success and manage their resources appropriately. Making plans itself is a part of the way to successful results. For example, I got successful results last semester thanks to the detailed plans I had made.
I used my time efficiently, which leads to more study and good grades. There were some unexpected events in the semester, but I always had enough time to deal with them. In conclusion, planning makes success feasible.
    To get and maintain success, making plans is nessesary. Success always visits whoever is ready and prepared. With own study plans, students would get good grades this semester."	4.5	4	5	13.5

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	" The new president of KAIST is keep amphasizing the importance of taking risks or changces. In fact, new laboratory for studing failure made this year. I believe this new movement will make KAIST better in the future.
 Although some people believe that they can control risks by careful planning, risks are our of our hands. One great example would be Corona pandemic. Even though someone made careful plans, they could not avoid it. So, taking risks at least in regulated circumstances, such as schools, will prepare people more to adjust in this randomized world.
 The next advantage is that taking risk makes you plan better. Taking risks means that you challenges more. By doing so, you can get more information about your ability and capability. Then you can make plans more percisely based on that information. In my case, I took risk of taking 10 courses this semester. Now, at the near end of the semester, I can understand my capability more clearly. So, now I can make more suitable study plans after this semester.
 To summarize, taking risk is more likely to lead to success. Although it can be an efficient way, we have to admmit failuer is usually painful. The president of KAIST should find ways to support the risk takers by developing new policies."	3	2.5	3	8.5
781	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"What is the successful life? It might be related to making a lot of money or getting a great authority. Each person has his or her own way to succeed, but nothing is easy. In this regard, many people say that they should have done the different actions when they faced some events. To avoid such regretting, people need to take a risk or have a thorough plan. I think taking a risk is more important factor than the latter because a chance is hard to meet and active actions often make the matters easier. 
 First, the opportunities are very rare. Sometimes, people meet the charming chance that they can grow a lot if they catch it. However, in many cases, people ignore such a chance because they think that they are not ready and such good chance will come again. Almost everytime, it becomes their regretful actions. In fact, I have such an experience. When I entered the university, I saw the welcome announcement of a famous programming camp. I had wanted to join that camp, but I thought that I had to practice first. After one year, I could see the cancelation announcement of the camp due to the COVID-19. I am feeling so regretful that I should have caught that chance. To sum up, it is important to get an appropriate chance even if people have some unproud points about that.   
 Second, the attitude of active challenge is helpful to overcome the obstacles. Some argue that too fast action makes the person fail. It is true. Not to overlook the problems, people need to focus on their situations and choose the optimal road.  However, such a attitude can make people too shy. They often avoid to challenge even though they have enough abilities to solve the problems. Also, some challenges make the people grow. Such an experience cannot be made if people are sitting down. In short, people should challenge actively. 
  In conclusion, taking a risk make people catch an approriate chance without regretting and make people better. It may be so scary choice. However, it is worthy to challenge. Only one who challenges can take a juicy fruit."	4	4	4	12

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	" Where does the success come from? A lot of people wanted to find the answer for this question and made each different results. Thesedays, some people may think success in life results from taking risks. For example, Nike use the logo ""Just do it"". However, actually many success comes from careful planning. With a well made plan, people can complish there tasks with confidence and react easily to the chaning environments.
  First of all, careful planning gives people comfortable and confidence. This is because people know what to do today for the successful results. For example, can you imagine a successful 'Advanced Writing class' without any syllabus? Students won't know what they will gonna learn for the class when there is no syllabus. They can study writing anyway, but the results won't be satisfing. However, they can prepare for the eassay writing or post-test exam if teacher has a plan for the class. People won't be worry about the tasks how they have to do today for the successful results, rather just follow the plans they have already made. Therefore, with a nice plan, people can complish the tasks comfortably.
  Second, with a good plan, people can struggle better with unexpected situations. This is because the most important thing of having a nice plan is that people can change it. So when things go wrong, they can rewrite their plan and keep going for the goal. For example, I make a schedule for the submissions I have to do until next week. This helps me modify the plan when unexpected thing, such as slept all day accidently, happens. There may some problems with a new plan but leads to the goal that I wanted anyway. Therefore, having a carefult plan can handle the unexpected situations which can threaten the success I wanted.
 In conclusion, having a nice plan is an important thing if one wants to achieve a success. It will give confident and always show the direction to the final goal even though the path may change. Making a plan is the easiest way step for having a success. Why don't you try to make a nice plan for our life and get a nice results?"	4.5	4	3.5	12

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"  Let's think about How much money you should need for one month. When you compare that with your income, you will realize you can not make success with careful planning. In my opinion, to success in life comes from taking risks or chances.  I want to talk about why we should taking them with life length reason, society reasons, and economical reason. 
  First, your life is too short to success with careful planning. We should think about how much year we can work. In normally we can only work on your jobs less than 30years. Although some people can get enough money in careful planning with using less money, I do not think we can't get enough money with just using less money. Because we must use some money for our life, and it makes we can't collect enough money with only using less money. we should get much more money than careful planning to success, it means we should take risks or chances.
  Second, In our society, the money makes money and there are a lot of opportunity in nowadays. In society moneys make money faster than works make money. so, it means it is very hard to success without enough money from your family. If you don't have enough money, you are in the backward position in race, it means you have to do something to reach success. In conclusion, it must be a take risks or chances. Also, in these days, we have some rapid differences nowadays. It makes many chances than before. This is another reason why we must take chances to success. For example, a lot of company about IT which made since 1990, earn much more money than other country. If you have abillity and take the chances about them, you can make success much more easily. 
  Third, we should take risks to get high return. In economy, there are theorem about risk and return. we do not have the low risk high return things. For instance, put money in banks means low risk low return and put money in stocks mean high risk high return. We need to get high return to success in life according to the second reason. In conclusion, you should take some risks to get high return.
In summary, if you don't have enough money, you can't make enough money in your life with careful planning. We do not have any way with low risk high return, so we should take some risks or chances. I think this is not a good society for many people, but this is the only solution to success without help from your parents. "	4	3.5	3	10.5

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Most of peoples who success in life commonly says that it's important to take risks. Although choose way to taking risks is not easy, it's directly associated with success in life. If you want to success without risks, it will be more harder than taking it. Taking risks are easiest way to success in life because of three properties: more rewards, valuable trying, and overcome risks is easier than avoid.
     Firstly, taking risks give more rewards than never taking risks. Most of risky works give more money to workers. Because it mind to many people, workers who do these kind of work get more money. For example, repair electric cable in water is dangerous works, and they got more than 100 million won in one year. Therefore, take risky works will give more rewards which like wealth to you. Also, risks give pleasure to people sometimes. Some kind of risk may turn in to fortune to people. If you forgive to taking risks, you also forgive your chance get fortune. 
     Second, taking risks make you more valuable. Risky works makes you more skillful. Almost of risky works need high level of techniques and knowledge; so it makes worker became master of that work. These kind of skills will be helpful when they get other job, because they are more valuable than other peoples who didn't experience that. Although, risks may makes you more honorful. Because of risks are avoided to many people, he will be very famous who try to do that.
     Finally, avoid to risk is not easier than try to overcome risks. Peoples face many risks in their lifes, and it is impossible to avoid all of these. Some people say that this is the reason that why people should planning more carefully. However, some kind of risks are can occur without any evidences. Many risks occur suddenly, and they are not expectable things. So planning all about risks are impossible. Despite of avoid all about risk is hard, try to overcome risks are easier. Even though expectations are not useful to take care of risks, prepare things to protect from dangerous is easier. For instance, you may prepare some foods and waters when you try to discover jungles.
     In summary, taking risks are very important for success in life. Taking risks give more rewards to people and make them more valuable. Also, overcome risks will be more easier and useful than avoiding them. Even though choose way to taking risks is hard considering, it will be the easies way to make life more successful."	4	4	3	11

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Every company has a lot of money borrowed from a bank or other companies. However, companies don't afraid of borrowing money and have confident. In fact, without borrowing money, it would be impossible to build a huge company. Some people said that people should carefully planning what they are going to do to make a success; however, I disagree with the opinion. We should take risks or chances to make success because of two reasons. 
     Firstly, taking risks and chances is the only way to adjust the fast movement of today's business model. In detail, to follow the trends of IT business, which is today's leading business and chaning fast, risks and chances are necessary. Blackberry is the typical example of the company that is collasping because it didn't take risks and failed to follow the trends. When the Blackberry's phone first came out to the world, it's unique design and innovative technique attracted numerous consumers around the world. Hence Blackberry won the first place in the competition of the phone industry. In the meanwhile, the Iphone born with Steve Jobs and the phone's trend changed from unique design to smart phone. However, Blackberry didn't try to follow the trend and as a result, people don't buy Blackberry's phone, anymore. Because Blackberry didn't take risks or chances to move forward to the smart phone, it is now became an old school. To sum up, we should follow the leading business model, and we should take risks and chances for that.
     Secondly, to make a success, we should try what other people don't try. Specifically, it is much easier to dive into new field to make success. Today, a person can't succeed in the internet searching industry because everyone uses Google, which is leading internet searching company. Hence, no matter how much we advertise to people use our product, people won't use our product. However, if we dive in the industry such as salad delivering industry, it would be much easier to make success rather in the internet searching field. Actually, Korea's famous comedian launched his own chicken meat brand and made a huge success, because there weren't many or leading company which produce chicken meat. In short, even though diving into fields what others don't do is a large risks, one can make success easily than diving into well known field.
     In conclusion, taking risks and chances is inevitable to make success. It might looks dangerous but a necessary process to make success to follow the trends and develop a new field. If you want to change a world, then take risks. Remember, high risks, high return!"	4.5	4.5	4	13

Some people think that success in life  results from careful planning because  they can learn how to manage their time and money which is one of important segments for success life by planning. On the other hand, I think success in life comes from taking risks or chances by two reasons.

     First of all,  people who experience lots of risks or chances can overcome the difficulties which suddenly happened. There are many obstacles to have success in life such as, canceling the important meeting  suddenly.  In these situations, people who make a careful planning would be frustrated  because they always live their life fit in the plan. Therefore, it is hard to overcome these difficulties which suddenly happened for them. However, people who experience many risks in their life can solve these situation easily.
     Secondly, people who experience lots of risks or chances can overcome a lot of faillure in their life. Planning people can give up easily because they did not experience enough faillure. On the other hand, people who overcome lots of risks or chances can solve this situation because they have strong mental. For example, Edison experienced lots of faillure to make a lumb, but he didn't give up. He studied more about lumb and have lots of tries to make lumb. Finally, he made a lumb at first, so he can record his name in history.

They have their dreams to be successful in life, so they try to find the methods which can lead them to success.  Although some people prefer taking risks for the success, making a well-prepared plan is another interesting method which can bring people to reach thier goals.
          One can select their best choice from a plan that they make. To make a careful plan, they have to spend much time to consider the possible positive and negative impacts of their choices; therefore, one can predict what the consequence of their choice is. For example, one who is going to enter a university. One will select the university which best fits their preference. Therefore, a plan provides a guideline for people so that they can choose the best choice based on thier preference.
          One would say that people should take risks first. If they fail, they still come back and be stronger. This statement might be true.  Nevertheless, a well-prepared plan can make sure that  people can solve the mistakes quickly and easily. Someone may spend more than a year to come back from the mistakes they made;  however, with a plan, one can make an alternative choice because they already forecast the possible consequences. For example, if they are rejected by the university, they know which university they want to apply as the second choice. To sum up, people can encounter any problem or obstacle and solve them easily with the plan they made.
         In conclusion, people can make the best choice and encounter the possible mistakes if they make a careful plan. Life is not easy. That is why we have to spend more time thinking about life and what we want to do for success."	4.5	4.5	5	14
788	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"I think success comes from taking risks or chances. Some people may think that careful planning makes people comfortable and every tasks that they do will go well. Recently, some people who succeeded live withoug plans and trust their own feelings and others make plan to make their company well. However, we have to take risks at least once in our lives. There are three reasons that i think success comes from taking risks or chances: no chances if we just live with plan, to make impressive results and first taking risks and after careful plans.
 Firstly, It is very hard to get chances to success. Many people think that taking a route that others made is a key to success. However, I think that is not success. It's just the way to live normally same as other people. The most important element of success is to make people know us. If we don't do this task, success is already impossible because there are so many people who have same university and career. It is impossible to success if we try to be same with people around us. To make people know us, we have to take risk and chance like participating in big contests or explaining and emailing to people who already succeeded. 
 Secondly, I think one impressive thing is better than hundreds of normal things. It has high probability that will make normal things if we just schedule normally. It wouldn't make fastest way to succeed because everyone has no interest in normal things. Taking a risk has a big probability to fail but can make interesting results. For example, I participated in science contest that students have to make impressive science inventions when i was in high school. Even though there was almost zero possiblility to succeed, we tried again and again. And the experiment succeeded at one day before the due date. We almost couldn't submit our results but we can have big prize since we tried with taking risks. 
 Lastly, taking a risk should be first thing. Some people think that taking risks make a lot of stresses because it would lead to many failiures. However, people have to do tasks that they really want to.  We can see various people who got success like wealth and honorship. I read about their story a lot in the interview. In those interviews, many people think they are well scheduled by a lot of secretaries and managers. However, these schedules are possible because they already took risks and chances when they had nothing.
 These are the three reasons that i think success in life comes from taking risks or chances. We can live normal with strick plans but big success comes from taking high risks. Because we have our own life once, taking risks is worthwhile to be a person who succeed."	5	4	3.5	12.5

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Have you ever bought some lotteries? In most cases, you were not able to win the lottery.
 For those familiar with planning their future, it is easy to grab the opportunity. Scientists thoroughly plan to experiment so that they can predict its result. For example,  many scientists have struggled to observe gravitational waves predicted by Einstein's theory. In fact, the gravitational waves were not observed at all for about 100 years; however, a research team observed them at last. Without thorough experimental plans, the research team could not accomplish their achievements. This example clearly shows that only those with plans can understand circumstances around them, and that they can prosper in life.
 Those with careful plans can make their own opportunity those without plans cannot have. Some people think that not all the plans becomes real because life is full of unexpected accidents; therefore, careful plans are useless. It is true, but paradoxically it is the reason why people need to make a plan in advance.  With plans, people can escape unexpected predicaments because they have ever experienced  the predicaments indirectly  by planning.
 In sum, people can succeed in their life with plans because they can understand circumstances around them, and because people need to  prepare for accidents."	3.5	2.5	3	9

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"How can we success in life? It is the question that all people around the world would have. Some people would say that the success results from challenging many chances which are taking risks, too. However, making careful plan is more stable and easier way to success. There are many benefits to make plan compare to just challenging: taking low-risk, getting high-return, living controllable and comforatble life.
 First, we can take less risk from making plan. If someone want to do something, it can be not only success but also fail. If he or she would just challenge that before any plans when he or she fails it and failed to do that, then he or she would get some risks. Of course, it would be just low risk and he or she can challenge it again. However, if the risk is larger than he or she thought, he or she wouldn't be able to do it again. To prevent this situation, it's important to making other plans when he or she fails to do their project.
 Second, we can get high return from making plan. If someone who want to challenge many times is told to wonderful chances, then he or she would agree that without thinking about other ways. However, if there were the better ways? It would be better to think about what can we do, and make many plans. Then, make choice after comparing and contrasting the good&bad points among the plans. It is the best way to get the highest return that we can get.
 Finally, we can live more controllable and comfortable life. Someone would think that 'We cannot control our life'. Of course, it is true. We cannot control all the part of our life. However, there must be controllable part in our life, and we can enlarge that part through making careful plan. Challenging people don't think about fail as much, so they wouldn't control what should they do. They would make each decisions at the time when they have to, and they are concerned about the chance that those decisions would lead them to fail. However, people who have well-organized plans doesn't have to think about it. If they just follow their best plan, then they would live more controllable and comfortable life than challenging people.

 To sum up, with careful planning, we can take low-risk, get high-return, and live controllable and comfortable life. As we take these benefits from planning more, we can get closer to our success. Therefore, we can get success easier through making good plans."	4	3	2.5	9.5

However, someone believes that success results from careful planning. It is hard to choose which one is correct. But, I think careful planning is a shortcut to acheive success in life for three reasons.
  First, careful planning can be a guideline to our life. In other words, it can work like a goal to us. For example, think of two people who lost the direction on the road. In that situation one has a map and the other has nothing. Then, who can overcome that situation more easily? Most of people say person who has a map. Likewise, people who have a careful plan in their life can acheive goals more conveniently.
  Second, plans can motivate people. People may have experience of using planner. It can be used for studying or meeting. Whether people are using planner or not, plans in people's mind can motivate them. For instance, you have an important meeting at tomorrow morning. Then, you might think about plans of tomorrow and try to follow the plan. Although this kind of following plans can make your life tired, you lead your life to more bright side. In other words, plans have a powerful force to motivate people. 
  Last reason is that prepared people have more chance than others. Although some people think that success in life comes from taking risks or chances, the ability to overcome that risks and grab that chances can be learned by careful planning. For example, in interview, you have to choose talented people. In that case, everyone can understand that well-prepared person will make a great impression to interviewers. Thus, careful planning is a way to success in our life.   
  In conclusion, now readers can understand that careful planning can make success. Because it can be a guideline, can motivate people, and can make us grab the chances. If you are in a situation important in your lifr, then make careful plans. It will leads you for better life. For the last, there is a famous letter in Korea which shows the significance of plan, ""prepared person can get a chance."" "	4.5	4.5	4	13
792	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"What do you want to do if you have a lot of money and honor? Everyone must have thought of this at least once.  Like this, Everyone wants to succeed. Some people want to succeed through lotto and others want to succeed through stocks. There are many ways to succeed, however, I think people should take risks or chances to succeed for three reasons. 
 First,  nothing can be accomplished just by sitting still and making plans. Simply, people have to act  directly just to do walking.  In order to achieve something, people have to practice and challenge even if it is small.  Even if people fails, it becomes the foundation for the next challenge.   
 Second,  to succeed, it is necessary to differentiate ourselves from others. Anyone can make a plan, but no everyone can succeed. It means that even if people make a plan carefully, it is hard to succeed.  People can get a chance of success by challenging themselves to avoid and not doing others. This is why people try to find blue ocean. The way that others have not walked on is hard, but it benefits more. 
 At last, some people say that people can succeed only if they go step by step through careful planning. However, in this way, people cannot surpass their social class. Resources such as money are limited, and the social class is fixed. Therefore, to succeed, people must withdraw money from others and transcend their social position. For this, it is necessary to take great risks and overcome them to obtain great rewards. 
 Success is given to those who act. People who only act can get chances to success. To succeed, people should break  The greater the risk, the more rewards and success  people can get."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
793	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Alexander Fleming is a famous scientist who made the Penisilin. But do you know how he discovered the original material of it? He went outside with his lab window and experiment badge opened, and the material just flew in to the lab and landed on the badge. When he came back to his lab, he found that something was different about the badge compared with the moment when he went outside. This is a good example of success in life which came from taking risk or chances. Although some people think that the success in life comes from taking risks or chances, I think that it comes from careful planning. 
   First, a person should take opportunities carefully since there are limited chances in his or her life. Suppose the Calculus final exam is 3 days left and a student started to study since yesterday. The student planned to mainly study with the textbook basics and exercise problems. He or she done studying basics about half of the exam range. Then, there is a sudden opportunity because the student found the exam papers of last exam. The student can take the risk or chance, which means he or she started to solve last exam problems, or he or she can keep studying about the basics and easy problems. That was story of mine last semester. I kept studying on basics, and I got good grades. I don't know whether I would have got better grade or worse grade if I chose to solve last year problems. But one thing is certain: changing the way of studying was risky. In short, people should take opportunities carefully, and taking sudden opportunities is not about it.
   Second, if someone plan carefully, then there would be no or only weak obstacles ahead. Some people argue that if someone take risk and fail, it is still worthy: that person can find something valuable there and never forget. But, I think if the person planned carefully, he or she just didn't need to use the knowledge from failure because the obstacles of life will be easily expected. 
   In conclusion, Taking risk in life is not recommended because there are limited chances and hard to come back if the person fails. And If that person had planned carefully, expecting obstacles of life will be much easier. Even if there was a great opportunity like the case of Fleming, a person should be able to grab the chance. If there is not something he or she did or planned before, the sudden chance will have no meaning. Therefore I think people should do careful planning."	5	4	4	13
794	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Every people want to success in their lifes. To do so, some plan for their futures, and others take risks. Although these two strategies have pros and cons, it is better to take risks to be successful.
    First, although planning might bring good results, it might not be the best one. People make plans based on their memories. When something goes good, people remember it and do similar things to get good results. However, most of the cases, it might be local maximum. Therefore, if people want to get successful results, they must take risks and do something they haven't done before to get to the global maximum. For example, when practicing playing basketball, planning guy might practice shooting or dribling. On the other hand, risking guy would play many games and learn while playing.
    Second, learning from failures is effective way to become a master at something. Risking strategy might bring a lot of failures. However, one can learn from those. For example, Thomas Edison failed more than a thousand times to invent a light bulb. If he used planning strategy, he might have used so much time just sitting on a desk and planning to make a perfect light bulb.
    To sum up, to success in life, taking risks is better than planning for future. By taking risks, one can reach global maximum of success and learn from failures to be ready for one's future. Nobody knows what whould going to happen. Since plan can always be ruined, it is better to make a bet."	3.5	3	3.5	10
795	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	" There are many people who live a success life and a lot of people want to live like them.  So many people study and work hard to achieve success.  Then how can people achieve it? Some people say success in life comes from taking risks or chances, and others say that success results from careful planning. Both are not wrong, but the opinion that success comes from taking risks or chances is more appropriate.
  First, people can't do all plans in life. In life, there are many situations that people can't expect. Some people say that careful planning can make future life more clear and it allows people to know what to do. But it's wrong since life is always full of situations that we can't expect. Those situations can be their chances, or they can be risks. The people who overcome those risks and use chances well become successful people. Successful people  such as many enterprenuers, nation's presidents had many risks such as being fired in company or being arrested by police when they were younger. And they all tried to overcome those well. 
 Second, if people only focus on their plans, they do not react for important changes or innovation in society. People who like to make plans might not see important changes or innovation. Successful people always react those situations faster than other and make alternative ways. For example, LG didn't focus on smart phone and only make former type phones, but Samsung tried making smart phone. As a result, Samsung caught the chances and now Samsung is global smart phone company, but LG quit making smart phone. 
 In conclusion, taking risks or chances is more important than careful planning because no one can expect future and people can see world's innovation and changes more quickly. This does not mean that people should not plan. In fact, there should be some plans.  But instead of focusing on plans entirely, knowing that plans can always change and acting appropriately when risks and chances come are far more important. "	4.5	4	4	12.5
796	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Everyone wants to be successful in their field and no matter what field is this: music, bussiness or reasearch. If someone succeeds in something, he has reached the highest level of happiness that not everyone can feel. Most people say that hard work is the main key to become successful, and moreover, most successful people say the same. Although success is closely related with hard work, I think that without particular circumstances or luck, it is too hard to succeed in anything. 

First, we can't know what happens tomorrow and it is very hard to predict the future. Imagine the person finds enough encourage to start to play some musical instrument, for example piano. He starts to attend the musical classes every evening and after one month he notices some progress. He is happy and wants to learn more and more. And, one day very bad thing happens so that he breaks his fingers, maybe playing volleyball. 

Second, everyone should know that to get something we always need to lose something. I think that success is when you reach the highest level in something you realy obsessed with. So, to reach that level one needs to make a lot of affort, and spend most of his time and energy on that thing. When people focus on one thing there is always something they lose in their live. For example, in cybersport people play computer games all day. If they don't play enough they lose their skill and someone better replaces him. The salaries and the pleasure they get worth their efforts. But, playing a game people don't study and don't invest in their future. Also, it is very hard for them to find a wife or a husband because of their poor comunicational skills. Another example, is being Olympic champion in real sport. Like in cybersport, people train from morning to evening, risking their future for one medal, because training takes most of their time and there is no time for the development in other fields. So, being successful is result of big risks. "	5	4	4	13
797	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I think that the way to study is depedent on what we are study. We can divide some lectures into memorizing subjects and understanding subjects. I want to say when you are doing with memorizing subjects, you have to study alone. In the other hand, you will be better to study with other classmates. There are two reasons to support my opinion. 
First,  memorizing have to be pritorized before we make a conversation about topic. Let's suppose a topic corona virus. I want to talk about the effects of the corona vaccine. However, the pair of this conversation doesn't know anything about this topic. Then, we cannot share our opinions related to the corona vaccine. Like this case, if we want to study with a group of students, we have to memorize some important terminologies and theorems related to suggested topic. Then, we can share our opinions with other students in positive ways. Moreover, we can study about the higher concepts by some explanations of other smart students. You can explain either. However, suppose you don't know anything about this topic. You will lag behind others. Also, some students who explain ideas to you will give up due to the delay of time. 

Second, studying with a group of students is very effective. For example, there is the way to study called ""Habruta"". This is introduced by Udain studying showing their libraries. In the documentary of Udain studying - Habruta - , the students talk with each other to take a debate about a topic that they learned. Due to this debate, Udain libraries always very noisy. Actually, I took the Habruta with my classmates in the high school. We gathered in a classroom and solved the problems together. After that, each student came out the front and explain their solutions using the blackboard. We debated about solution of our classmate either correct or wrong and talked about what is the best solution among ours. It helped me a lot because we can see lots of viewpoints in one problem.

I mentioned about the ways to study. Even though I took a lot of exams, there are many exams left. To get the successful score, we will have to research and find what is the best way to study."	3.5	4	3.5	11
798	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I prefer to study with a group of students. And not just prefering it, but I strongly think that study with a group of students is better than studying alone mostly at every situations.
I have two reasons why I think like this and I want to share them.

First, studying with a group of students motivates us to study very well.
You might have an experience that you watch youtube videos or play mobile games while you decided to study or do assignments alone.
These experiences directly comes from your decision that you study alone. But If you decided to study with your study mates, 
you might care about other eyes of  study mates, and you might have to concentrate on studying anyway. 
And once you study or maybe pretend to study, the situdation is way better than not studying. 
And the concentration also grows up steadily. That is first reason why I think study with a group of students are good.     

Second, when you have question, you can get quite good answer for any question from your study mates.
Whatever you study, there are a lot of things you don't know and that's why you study. 
But everytime you have question, you can not meet experts and there are bunch of not reliable information on the internet. What about your study mates? They may have similar level of knowledge that you have. So, they can tell you the solution in the way that easy to understand. Although they also don't know the right answer, question itself is a new insight for the study mates, and have opportunity to study deeply in that part.
Here is the reasons why I think with a group of students and I think studying with study mates is very nice decision."	3	2.5	3	8.5
799	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	" In my case, I prefer to study as a group. Sometimes I study alone, but I like to study together. There are two reasons of this.
 First, it’s more interesting. Usually, I study with my friends like study groups. From hard studying of other students, I get motivation and power to do. With friends, studying isn’t just boring, and I can enjoy that moment. We make a final goal like having good grade in class, so this motivate me to study hard to keep this plan or goal. And when I’m tired or just playing without keeping plan, friends call or chat to alarm me. I can’t give up because of them. This make me study harder and longer. 
 Second reason is efficiency. During exam period, time is important. To save time, efficenty is important in studying too. And studying with friends is efficient. For example, we can make simple quiz that can test the state of my studying. Also, sharing answers of practical problems is helpful. These activities make study easier. Sometimes other students teach me something hard to understand. And I can teach them too. I think that you know ‘teaching other is one of good ways to study.' By this way, I can get some important points that I missed. It gives positive effect to all students of a group. As my experiences, making studying group and concrete plane were best ways to my grade.
 Thus, I like to study with a group of students. It is interesting and efficent for studying. I recommend studying together to people who feel like that studying is too hard and boring. Making studying groups will be helpful to them."	2.5	3	2.5	8
800	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"When I studied hard, I prefer study alone.
First, when I study with my friends, I became to chat with friend. Just short break is good for efficiency, but this chat or play time is often so long. So I can't finish my assignment or assigned study in given time. Even though, they are not friends, just student group who I don't know, my mind is not so good than study alone.
Next, studying with group of students makes synergy and they can learn from each other. But I think time when I study and review the content only by myself is must be needed to get great understanding. When I was high school student, I listen the time study alone must be longer than time taking internet or real lecture. I think this can adapted to university same.
Finally, if I want to study with friends, I make some appointment with friends, and check or reserve open room(not library). This is major problem in group study, so sometimes I can't study at time or place I want.
For these reasons, I like study hard alone in library, cafe, or dormitory."	2	2.5	2.5	7
801	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"      I have studied about 13years of my life. Among the 13 years, for recent 2 years learnd especially difficult knowledges, such as solid mechanics and thermodynamics. During the study on my own, I felt I need peer for test wheather my conceept is right or not. So, I called to my friend and I studeid with him.
      there are some advantages for study in group. First, you can get the correct concepts. By making conversation with friends, you can find the akward things. Then you can ask it for another friends or proffessor. Second, your knowledge getting deeper and wider. By discussing about some subjects, you can think somthing about you've been never before. Finally, it helps to control the schedual. Group study need the time reservation. It can not be made later easily so the time table is not changed. 
      As you know, we can do 'study alone' in alone! You can study when you want, what you want. If you don't have time, you can make the time for your study to reduce your sleep. I mean it is flexible. But, on the other hand, you can study in group only you've decided the time for study before. It means, group study is more special. Everyone can study alone but not in group. Therefore, if you can study both anlone and in group, you hshould choose the both.
     To sumarise, you can take the both advantages of group study and study alone if you make the study group. You can get various knowledges to study alone and make it deeper by study group. Take the good stretagy and good luk!"	3	3	3	9

    Today is the fall semester beginning day. It is the day when many students want to get great grade and start to study very hard. However, there are two big different types of studying. Some students prefer to study alone, others prefer to study with a group of students. Students can prefer both of them but, I prefer to study with a group of students with 3 reasons. 
    First of all, group of students can help each other. we cannot understand perfectly at the first time, so we ask about missing part to group. Then both of students get benefits. one of student can get informations about missin part and the other can easier to memorize or understand than before. 
    Second, group studying can grow our friendship. When we study with a group of students, we have a common topic to talk to other students infinitely. Also, when other students get tired, other students give them chocolate or juice. 
    Finally, group studying is of of the competition. Although students in group help each other, getting grade is competition. Unfortunately they should fight for better grade, so they study more hard than study alone. 
    In conclusion, there are three reasons why I prefer to study with a group of students. I think group studying is the best way to get grade  "	2	3	2	7
803	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"    Some people might think that studying in a group is a better way to learn something. However, in my opinion, studying alone without anyone else is the best method to make academic accomplishment. This is because you can save your time, preventing others from distrubbing your focus, and concentrate only on yourself while studying. 
    To begin with, you can studying more while you review what you have studied alone. Imagine what would happen to you if you decided to study with your close friends. You should chat to your friends in order to make schedule with them. Also, you should go to the cafe or library to study. Everything takes time. Moreover, even if you choose close place to study together, you would waste your time while chatting with your friends. 
    I will talk about me and my friends to elucidate my idea. When I was a high school student, an earthen science teacher told students to study the subject in a group. We had studied together one hour twice a week. In the beginning, we were not close enough to play with each other, so we focused soley on the topics. However, over time passed, we became close to each other and chatting time was increasing. Eventually, we played more than studied. Finally, we ended up getting lower grades than previous semester.
    On top of that, you can find which part you are good at or not only if you are far away from people. For studying, it is important to know whether you understand properly or not. You should spend time alone to figure it out while concentrating on you. If you study in a group, you would like to talk each other what you know about the topic. Although you seem to know it very well while speeking, you might notice that you understand it poorly, writing what you have learned. You can't check whether you understand the concepts with your group members. 
    A study conducted by a group of educational majors in 2013 is a good example of this. The reseachers wanted to know which methods were the best to effectively learn academic materials. There were two groups of students. A group was composed of students who had learned by instructing what they knew to the doll, and another group was consisted of students who had studied by writing what they knew. The result was impressive. Those students studying by writing had better grades than others.  In the following interview, one students in the second group told that she could organize connected concepts while expressing her idea through writing. This study support that studying alone with writing essays is better than debating with your group members.
    In conclusion, I think that studying as a group overconsumes your precious time and keeps you from thinking deeply. Therefore, I strongly believe that studying alone is the key to acchieve academic success."	4	4	4	12
804	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"There are some issues about 'Mento - Menti' program. 'Mento' and 'Menti' are role of students, and 'Mento' teaches 'Menti'. There are some people who don't like this program say that 'Studying with a group of students is not good for growing their skill because this program makes the students playing, not studying.'. However, I prefer to study with a group of students, therefore I like 'Mento - Menti' program. I'm going to introduce three reasons that why I like group studying.
First, teaching other student is better to remember than studying alone. There are several statistics about it. By teaching other people, we can say about the contents and reader's ear listens it again. Therefore, his brain remembers it twice. It causes higher remembering efficiency than studying alone. Also, students are not professional. So they know what they don't know more exactly than lots of teachers. It makes the students can explain more efficiently.
Second, if there is a friend next to me, I can pay attention more because he is watching me. Imagine, if you are doing some other things just like watching youtube, or tearing hands during studying. And there is your friend, next to you. He can defense you from those temptations. Also, we can promise or play game just like ""Let's study during 3 hours. And the person who stops studying first, he should pay dinner."". This game can cause competition, and competition makes people more powerful to do not lose the game. 
Last, studying with a group of students can advance idea by talking with friends. We can share our ideas when we are doing group studying. Different people have different aspects, and different aspects can make bigger idea. Also, we can see the problem in other sight. In addition, we can debate if there are several aspects. Debating can make people understanding other thinkings and how to accept those thinkings. It advances people's sights.
By these three reasons, I prefer to study with a group of students. I can grow up my skills by group studying. Therefore, I'm planning to studying with several students furthermore. I hope you can also find the efficient studying way."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

     Since the problem of COVID-19 increases, meeting directly has decreased. Thus, it become our life to study alone without any connection. Some students  would think this type of studying is helpful by concentrating on their own assignments deeply. However, others who have opposite idea claim that it disturbs an opportunity to share ideas. In this situation, I think studying with a group of students is more helpful than alone.
First of all, we can easily understand lessons. Let's imagine the environment of a classroom. There are a teacher who teach and introduce a new knowledge and a student who understands it. It means that we need more than two people to study the new topics. Therefore, studying with a group encourages students who get hard to understand lectures to improve knowledge effeciently.
Next, studying with students seems to become an opportunity to share ideas. I think the main purpose of groups studying is talking and debating with various people. During this activity, students can notice new opinion by sharing their own idea. Thus, if you want to be more creative, studying with around you will be helpful.
Finally, it seems to let students find new area. By studying with students who have different majors, they can find a new path to solve problems by adding diverse ideas. They would search and try in more various ways than alone. It is necessary for students to develop their own areas. So, we should increase group projects for our future.
You may think studying alone is more helpful to study, but there are many advantages of group studying. It help students to understand lectures effeciently. Also, students can share thier views so that they search new ideas themselves. For these reasons, I prefer to study and research with a group of people."	2.5	3	3	8.5
806	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Some people insist that they can study well with a group. They think that group studying is an effiecient way to study with the benefit of sharing ideas. However, studying alone is an excellent method for students to learn something.
To start with, students can easily focus on the study. Giving an example of this, think of an situation that you are studying while other students are talking. They might talk about off-topic subjects, and even worth, they can play games or share jokes while you study. Is it possible to pay attention to the subject? You will have a hard time focusing on the subject, trying not to listen to your friends. But if you study alone, you can make your own space for studying which helps you to relax.
On top of that, there are some conditions to meet students and study in a group. Lots of efforts and time are needed to make a group and to meet your friends. You should pick members for a group. And you also need a place and common meeting schedule to start studying. While there are difficulties for a group-studying, you can start studying whenever you want by alone.  Any place that you can concentrate on can be your studying-place any time.
Lastly, your own educational method can be found when you study alone. There are various types of studying and knowing the best one for you is important. By group studying, you can get some helps from your friends. But they are specified for your friends, not you. My childhood experience is one of the instances. When I was kid, my best friend taught me one way of studying. Although I tried my best to get good grades with his method, it wasn't easy. After I found my own method, I could get better grades than before.
In conclusion, studying alone helps your concentration and insights for learning. Considering the conditions of group studying, alone would be a better choice than a group. So, I prefer studying alone than studying with others."	3	3.5	3	9.5
807	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	" For me, the better way to study is studying alone. Of course there will be a positive and negative effect to both studying ways, but I think studying alone is more suiteble for me. Now I will talk about why studying alone is better than studying with other people with examples.
 Before I start with the first reason why studying alone is better, I want to talk about the development of technology. As the technology developes Internet came out. Because of this Internet we are now able to access with enormous knowledge easily. The postitive point of studying  in group was deepening knowledge and sharing ideas. This was also the negative effect of studying alone. But the develop of internet erased this negative effect. Internets. Internets allowed us to know deep knowledge and see other peoples thought. Unlike the pass, only book was the way to get knowledge, but now we can get information and share ideas with Internet. When we study alone and get stucked with hard explantions, we can use internet. When we want to know other peoples thought or experts thought we can also use internet! Internet made us study deeper and easier even though we study alone.
 Secondly, all humans are not the same. Group studying can be the best way to share ideas and share different studying habits. But this can also be a poison for one person. People have there own habits to study and own environment to study well. But when we study together all person who studies in a group cannot satisfy these environment or habbits or etc. Think about when one friend in a study group likes to eat snacks when he studies but you hate hear that crunching sound. Also think about when your routine is studying in the morning and sleep at night but your friend likes study at night. So your friend turn the lights on all night long and keep asking you a questions. It is awful isn't it. But when you study alone you can make environment as you want. You can study any time whenever you want. So studying alone is better to keep habbits and routine for studier.
 Lastly, studying alone can make more concentration in studies. If we make a study group and study together they moght be a just the person who stuied together. But as the time passes they will become friends and plays together. Making a friend in a study group is good but it is not good for the studying envirnment. They can make positive effect together but their deepness of concentration we be get weak. Also, think about you just got concentrated in the book but your studymate asks you a question and breaks your concentration. But when we study alone we can concentrate as deep as we can and rest as my own routine. So I espect the deepness of concentration wil bo much deeper when we study alone.
 As the internet developed we can make same positive effect, deepening knowledge and sharing ideas, even we study alone. We can also make own study routine and study habbits, environment. And the deepness of concentration is much deeper when we study alone. For those reasons I think studying alone is better for the studier."	3.5	3	2.5	9

I went to space camp with my friends and learn lots of things about our universe. The camp was really stunning because it let us to watch stars and planet using  scope. It was the first time I watched the surface of the moon, and also the moment that I fall in love with science and space. When I told my mom that I wanted to be  an astronomer, she told me that you have to study a lot. Before then, I loved to draw and playing soccer with my friends. Therefore, it might be the first time that I determined to study hard. Since I entered middle school, I spent most of time in studying. I tried lots of things to find the most appropriate studying techniques to me. One of them is studying with a group. It allows me to understand better and memorize more things. If I have to choose the best way to study, I will say that group study is the best. There are two reasons why I think like this.
 First of all, group study makes  us understand perfectly about the lecture. During communication we can be both teachers and students. In group studying, people repeat to ask each other and answer.  Other students can explain the parts that you don't know well and you can also explain to other students. By explaining the parts you know well, you can perfectly memorize and understand those parts. Also you can understand the lectures which you are not good at. If we continue this process, we can perfectly understand whole lectures. In my case, when I was  highschool 2nd grade, me and my friends studied physics in group for final test. I was good at Newton's law and my friends were good at Electrics. We ask each other about problems that we can't solve and study together. Eventually, we got better that mid term test that we studied alone.
 In addition, efficiency of studying is better in group study. As you can experienced when you studied at public places such as library, you can concentrate better. It's because places are in quiet mood and all people are studying.  If we study alone, we get easily tired and exhausted. How about studying together. A person next to you stimulates you, and you stimulate him. It like we do our best in competition. Like this, group study helps us to study harder and concentrate better.
  In conclusion, group study is good for understanding and studying much harder. While studying is not the most important thing in life, it's essential if you are student. So why don't you try studying in group and get better grade?"	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
809	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Studying. The most important thing to do as a student. I believe most of the people don't like to study, but studying is inevitable. You can't get avoid from it. Since the characteristic of the individual student is all different, their studying types would be differ too. I prefer studying in groups rather than studying alone because of following reasons. 
  First, studying within a group helps you to study more. By watching others studying in front of you, you will get extra energy for studying more because you will get stimulated by them. Vice versa, you can stimulate others by studying too. In my experience, when I study at my room, I could rest any time I want because no one was watching. But when I visit the library or cafe, there were so many people studying and it made me to study much more. 
  Next, your study mate and you can help each other. Not everyone is the best in all areas. For example, let's say you are good at physics, while your friend is the master of calculus. If you are struggling with calculus, all you have to do is just ask to him or her. Also, your friend will ask you about physics whenever he or she wants. By this way, both of you and your mate will receive help. 
  Finally, human is born to live in a group. Because of COVID, I chose not to go to dormitory at spring semester. It made much free time though, but I was bored since I couldn't meet any new friends. I wanted to meet people, and that's why I came here in this semester. Studying apllies here too. Studying with friends or any group will give you fresh feelings, because you can meet each other.  
  By these three reasons, I am sure that studying with a group is much better than studying alone. From now on, if you have plan to study something, try to study with a group. "	2	2.5	2	6.5
810	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	" In the libraries, we can easily find students who study. The point is, some are alone and some are together with their friends. How to study! It was always critical point for the students that they want more efficient and fun studying skills to get good grade. Well, I think the answer is choosing the better one for me. Then, what do I prefer? I preper to study alone and let me tell you why.

 First of all, I like to study alone because it makes me to concentrate on my study more than together. I think most of the reason people like to study together is that the process is really hard to maintain it alone. Studying the subject that we don't like cannot be fun and enjoyable thing to do. Therefore, people want to endure this process with others. Looking at the people, especially the friends in the same situation as me, makes the feeling 'releif'. It may seem great that it helps to overcome the difficult task, but the point is, they all go into 'not-study' mode. Ironically, the group of students don't concentrate on the study and do the things like chatting or go out and having some snacks. Together, this also makes the feeling 'releif' that not only I am not studying. All students in the group are not studying! However, if you can stand the hard time at studying alone, you can conecentrate more and study more than together. This made me to get the better grade than before. As you know, there are no short way to get the good grade.
 Second, there are some people that ask me a question. To start, let's assume that the every person in the group eagers for the better grade. However, there are always someone that asks questions to another. Actually, this is not bad thing. It is the positive effect of the group studying, but to the student who recieve the qeustion, it is not welcomed. The concentration is stopped because of the question. After answering the question, to get back on one's phase, it is much harder than before. There might be objections like 'Answering the questions helps not only the asker, it helps the person who answers more!'. It is true. Answering the question makes the information that he or she studied organized and can remember more than not answering. However, I want to tell that if someone answers and the question was solved, the person who answered, doesn't need more studying! He or she is already understood well of the subject and I think they are just repeating to make sure. It means that the answerer already studied alone perfectly.

 These are the reasons that I like to study alone. It allows me to concentrate more, and there are no one to disturb. If you are studying together and not getting godd grade, why don't you try studying alone? First, it may be tough, but if you overcome it, it will show you the way to the grade that you want."	4	3.5	3.5	11
811	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	" There are variety of ways for students to study. Some students prefer to study alone, stating that it forms the better circumstances to concentrate. Others prefer to study with a group of students. What I think is that both ways have their own good points, and therefore it is necessary to use both of them in appropriate occasions. However, if I should choose only one of them, I would choose the latter one, studying with a group of students. This method has some helpful points, since it helps us to have communication with someone, helps to memorize difficult materials, and we can check ourselves.
 First reason is that it is able to have communication with someone. What I strongly believe is that test is also one of communications, between the test paper and the students or the teacher and the students. Students are very eager to know about the form of the test in most of the time. That is because they are able to know how or what they should study, and also to pratice in similar ways to the actual test. Practicing in similar forms is very important for test-takers, because  it will make them to be used to the test, not frustrated when received it. What I strongly suggest is that having communication with someone while studying, can be the chance to take a similar-form-test. One of the most often used ways of ""studying with others"" is to give and take problems and answers to each other. There, someone who gives problems take a deep look at the test materials, to find the good problems that might be in the real test. By having these steps, students can actually find out which are the things need to know, and which are not.
 Second reason is that it will be more helpful for students to memorize. You probably would have heard that listening to professors well in class will make your grade much higher. This doesn't mean that professors' words have some magical power, but it means that talking about some materials help them to memorize them better. Studying materials are mostly what you have never seen, and memorizing them can't be an easy task. Talking about those materials will stick some experiences that are much more natural to you beside those difficult materials, and will be able to help you during the test to take them out from your brain easily.
 Last reason is that you are able to check yourself. Sometimes, you might be satisfied that you have studied everything for the test, but recognize that you accidently skipped the part your friend is saying. By communicating with your peers about the test materials, you can check if you really studied everything, or you can check if you still memorize everything you have done. This is important step since some students think that they have memorized everything while studying, but can't take out from their brain during the actual test.
 You might have noticed but all the reasons are related to the steps you need to take after taking all the materials in your brain. Studying new things, for sure, require for you to be alone some time. However, I prefer studying with others because this helps us strengthening what we have studied, and I think that's the point for the high grade on the test."	3.5	3	3	9.5
812	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I usually study alone. I prefer it, and even think it's better than studying in group. There are several reasons for my opinion.
First, studying alone is much easier to concentrate. Imagine the situation that you are in a studying group. You have to memorize complex formula, but your group mates are talking about something else. Can you get focused on what you have to memorize? In my thought, you won't. Communication and debate are the most important parts of the group study, but I think these things might be an obstacle to concentrate. Many people cannot study while listening to music, and it is same in this case. But when you study alone, you don't have any disturbance. All you need to do is just concentrating.
Second, when you study alone, you don't have to think about other people's achievement. While studying in group, people notice what they know and what they don't know. And naturally, they will want to study more about what they don't know. But the problem is, the part people don't know is all different. They need to cover all parts for each person, and it makes the whole time for studying longer. You don't need to be annoyed by such things when you study alone. You can make your own studying shedule, and your plan will be more well-organized than that of group study.
As I already wrote, if you are going to study with your group, you have to consider your group mates' studying routine. And I think it is quite difficult and exhausting. So, for these reasons, I prefer studying alone."	2	2.5	2.5	7
813	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"  My opinion is that, what study method is more effective differs to the subject what I am working on. Case by case is a good phrase for my thought. So I will discuss about when studying alone is better, and when studying with a group is better. 

  First, studying alone is better when I memorize something or solving math problems. I memorize a lecture by drawing the outline of it in my mind. Also, I repeat it again more precisely to never forget it. If I do this procedure with my colleague, it will be hard for me to concentrate. When I work on math problems, I prefer to squeeze out the solution by thinking about it for a long time. Hearing the final solution what my friend said would be a mad situation for me. 

  On the other hand, studying together is better when I study programming or social studies. In programming, there are diverse codes that can solve a single problem. If I work with friends, we can discuss about what code is more effective and complete. While studying about the society and politics, deabating on issues can be helpful. Listening to other students’ speech as well as speaking my opinion can widen my point of view. 

Choosing whether studying alone or together, the desire to study hard is the most important thing. Thank you for reading!"	1	1	2	4

"Group study is thought that improves efficiency. But I do not think so. I feel studying alone is better than studying with a group. It has three reasons why I think studying alone is better.
  Firstly, we focus on the content much shorter when we are in a group. Since there are people, we become to want to talk about something or care about someone's behavior. Dense environment makes our attention blow away.
  Second, each person has different studying content. Although students are gathered for the same intention, detailed parts that we do not know are pretty different. It is possible that other people cannot answer about your question and you cannot answer the other's question.
  Finally,  we waste marginal time for meeting. Packing backpacks for meeting, finding seats, calling people take time. It is strange that we spend time to prepare study instead of doing study indeed. Our time can be used cherish if studied alone.
  To summarize, I think studying alone is better because we can focus the contents longer,  eventually have to study certain parts alone, can save the subliminary time."	2	1.5	2	5.5
815	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Let me tell you about my preference of studying. Actually, I prefer to study with a groupd of students than study alone.  There are several reasons why I want to do group-study.
At first, it is harder for me to concentrate on what I study when there are no person around me. Because I suddenly think a lot about unnecessary things, it is not adequate to study alone. I always start to think about strange things like where to travel, friends, family, and me. But when I'm with my friends, their presence make me concentrate better.
Secondly, we can help each other when we study together. There are many subjects and the things I'm good at and things my friends good at usually differ. So, I can help other friends study and he also can help me. And, when we need to think about creative ideas, it is better to think together. For example, when I was writing some report and was suffering by lack of idea, my friend help me imagine some reasons.
Lastly, we can be more familiar by studying together. Most of the people think that friends are people that we play with. But I think it is not good to just spend time on playing. Rather, I believe that we can be more familiar by spending boring time and doing what we don't want to-since I usually don't want to study. And also, it is more interesting to do something together.
In conclusion, I prefer to study together with my friends for the three reasons. To concentrate more, to help each other, and to be more familiar with friends. Because of the virus, I couldn't study in groups in the first semester, but I want to study together in this semester."	3	2.5	2.5	8
816	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"There are many types of people in our society. Someone want to be in 'high risk high return' situation, Others are not. Someone said that there is 3 change in each like. He think that success is made by catching their chances. However, I think careful planning is more important for success than take a risk.
    First, planning help people to expect future. People learn many thing by their experiences. They can make their past events more cleary for making their next events better. It is called cardful planning. So, careful planning is scientific. Scientist do make very careful planning, so they can expect the nature and even nearby future. They almost success in our history, so we can my huge civilization.
    Next, planning reduce our risk. Someone said ""No risk, No return"", but I do not agree this message. we can extremely reduce our risk by preparing. Also, we can change risk to new chance by this. In my experience, chess is game for risk and chance. But I prepared careful planning before my move, I can change other's all move to my chance. I realize that importance of planning at that time. life is too long, so we have a number of chance and risk in their lifes. So they should know about how to change risk to chance, so careful planning will be help them to do that.
     Finally, careful planning give them peace of mind. Everyone have anxiety about what they do not know. No one can expect the risk perfect. So, careful planning  reducing their risk reduce their anxiety. It is hard to think right for people who feel extreme nervous. For this reason, peace in mind is important, and planning ,too. In my test interview for entering KAIST, I have peace in mind thanks to my careful plans.
    In summary, prepare planning expect furture like science, reduce their risk, and give them peace of mind. For this previous reasons, they should prepare careful planning. Someone said that chance go to people already prepared. Like this message, It make your future better than prepare nothing."	3.5	3	3	9.5
817	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Many people thought that the luck or the chance is the only to get the success and someone who became the rich is just due to the luck. However, it is not true for anyone. I suggest that success come from careful planning with three reasons.
      At first, people get success to the specific way after they chose their field. There are many kinds of success in various fields. For example, being a famous soccer player is the one way to get the success. Other one is investing some buildings or some stocks and get the money using them. Both seems quite good success for most people. However, to get these successes, we must do some important things. You have to choose which way to get the success. Becoming the star player among the soccer players before not doing any exercies is impossible. It is also impossible to get the success by earning welfare from investment or buildings if you do not have any money. Thus, if you want to get the success that most people want, you have to choose your field where you want to get the success and think about what to prepare for the success.

     Next, someone who does not prepared for that chance could not get the success whether the chance comes or not. We have to make the careful planning not to make this situation. For example, if you know someone is good at the information of finance, you have to prepare for investment. If you also know someone is good at playing soccer, you have to take care of him/her and search for the team that the player can go. Like these examples, everything can be a chance to get the success. However, if you do not make any works or ready for the future, you can not get the any chance to success. Just dive in if you have the feeling it must make the successs that I want. Do not hesitate. The hesistation might make the success into fail. There is a right to make a regret after you make an many efforts on the chance.

     Finally, continuing the success is the base of the careful planning. We can not continue the success if we do not have the specific plans for the money or stock. For example, a few people earn lots of money by lottery. What comes after they gain lots of money? They almost bankrupted unless they had lots of money. The real reason is that they do not have any specific reason for spending money for sudden luck. On the other hand, the most of the riches maintain their welfares. The reason is not only their lawyers helped them, but also they know where the money must be used. They invest money, do not use money suddenly, and have some plans to spend money. The example shows how to maintain their success.

     To sum up, the success comes after we have the careful planning for above three reasons. You have to choose your field to success, prepare what to do for the success, and continue the success with your careful planning. Someone might say, ""Is there a success if I keep all the suggested ways?"" No, I can not promise at all. However, to increase the probability to get the success, I recommend you the keep above ways. At last, you must keep in mind that do not give up too easy and the strong willing might make you stronger. I wish everyone have a great success."	4	4	3.5	11.5
818	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Of course, success of life comes from careful planning. This specific and concrete planning is important and necessary work for our life. People live everyday life with planning. They write planners in workplace, check calander, make list of restaurant for lunch plan, and think steps for houseworks in weekend. We can’t imagine daily life without planning. Therefore, the careful planning is basic and fundemental assignment for success; bacuse of importance of pre-search and chance that only prepared people can get. 
     First, becuase success needs pre-search or test, it is important. Before determining something new, people should research and know the information about what it is and how to do it. If people take decision without enough consideration, the result can go out of their expectation. For example, few weeks ago, I went festival in Daejeon with friends. But I and my friedns couldn't participate it. Because I didn’t make specific plan and just go there, I couldn’t expact that large number of people. From this experience, I realized that planning is important and we should plan A and plan B for unexpacted situation. 
     Also, the second reason is that only prepared people can catch the chance. If someone don’t have reasonable plan and just take a risk, he or she would have big possibility to get failure. I agree with that taking risks is necessary for some situations. But before taking risks, people should plan various expactations and steps carefully. Like my exparience that I mentioned before, making second or third plan for unexpected situation is important. This method can help people from failure after big risks.
     In conclusion, the most important thing for successful life is careful planning. Becuase pre-test is necessary step for success and the only person who can catch the chance is prepared one."	4	4	3.5	11.5

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Everyone want to success in their life but not everyone catch the successful life. What conditions is needed for success? Some people say taking risks or chance, and others argue that success results from careful planning. Even though standard of success is different for each person, there are some people who are considered as successful. They can not become successful and achieve their goal just in luck or taking risks. They might tried hard something in their field in their best, so they can success. Success results from careful planning, and trying.
     Some people argue that taking risks or chances is most important for success saying that CEO of Apple or Microsoft can success by taking risks or chances. Taking risk is very important, and they might start with sparkling and amazing idea. But they do not success with only great idea. They might search for inverstor who can support their project, have many trials and errors, and make results that investor can be confident. So, success must needs careful planning and trying, even though having with great idea.
     Also, taking risks or chances is another name of luck. But life is only one time, so betting life is so dangerous. People have to planning carefully their life.
     Lastly, people can think of small success in their life easily. One common example is exam. Some people do not study whole range of book and want that exam question will be in range that they study. And they might receive lower score than people who study hard whole range of lecture. People who received high score make careful plan to study.
     Everyone might dream of success. If you want to become successful person, make plan for your goal and try your best. "	3.5	3.5	3	10
820	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"No one do not want to have success in their life. Most of people are interested in successful life such as earning a lot of money, making family or living for a long time. It is natural thing that people want success because their life is limited. Then how we success? Since there is no accurate answer, people all have different thoughts about their success way like taking risks or taking a plan. However, I think that taking a plan is better than taking risks or chances in three reasons.
      First, making a plan can maintain our routine. Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances claim that people cannot success without taking risks or chances. It is not truely false, but making a plan can make new chances. If people take a plan, they could have their own's routine. Routine is the most important part of life. It makes their body balanced and take care themselves. Eventaully, routine make new chances for them because routine keeps them healthy. Therfore, planning can not only make people's body healthy, but also make new chances for them. 
      Secondly, people making a plan do not frustrated becasue of their failure. Oppositions say that planning people cannot stronger anymore becuse they do not taking chances. However, planning people more stronger than others. Since they have a plan, they can raise up again if they fail. Plan makes people stronger. On the other hand, people taking risks are difficult to raise up when they fail because they do not have any plan about their failure. Thus, people can take chances infinitely through their plan. 
      Lastly, planning people can accept theri new chances or new environment. Opportunities not always come in time. They come in radom. People should prepare to take chances when they come. Planning is one of the best way to prepare to take chances. Originally they do their life following ther plan, so they cannot nervous when a new chance is coming. However, people taking risks can embrass when a new chance is coming. Thus, people need to have plan in their normal life. 
      In conclusion, I think that people succes results from careful planning for these tree reasons. It is free to choose their mehthod, but It hink it is best "	4	4	3	11
821	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"      Some might think that carefully written plans provide success for people. Well-organized plan offers chances make people do detailed activities. However, taking risks and chances is better than careful planning because it takes less times to make decision and gives unpredictable benefits. 
      Firstly, one may believe that there is enough time for planning everythings for future before things happening. However, the world is changing quickly; thus, there are chances that need a quick decision of people in order to get it. People who prefer to calculate pros and cons beforehead may lose the opportunity to have those chances. 
      Two people, Bryan and Tom, who are totally different can be a good example of my point. Bryan was one of my mother' friends, who liked to do risky adventures. On the other hand, Tom was a careful person, who prefered to choose save choices. One day, the teacher noticed that there were genious classes in the school. There were English, science, math and music classes. Bryan did not hesitate to sign up the class, whereas Tom couldn't keep thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of taking those classes. Finally, Tom ended up failing to join classes because of the late time. On ther other hand, Bryan recognized his talence in Science through the genious class and devloped his talent. Hence, Bryan became one of the greatest scientist in the world, who got Novel prices in 2008. 
        Secondly, one may argue that plans provides more various experiences. People who have plans can do activities that need plans. However, they unestimate the advantages of unpredictable events. Someone who prefer to take risks can build abaility that deal with unpredictable events. There is a lot of events that someone may not think about, but they have to solve those problems right away.  In addition, surprizing events can gives meaningful experiences people with luck. Someone with plan can not have those experiences because they do not take risks beileving lucks. 
        For instance, I decided to join experimental contest with my friend in science high school. It was surprising choice because I had operated experiments lesser than other students. Still, I believed that I and my friend would do well and joining contest itself would give meaningful experiences. Unfortunately, the first experimence was about physics, which is the weakest part of me. However, we did our best and won the contest. Therefore, we could compete with other students coming from various areas in Korea. We ended up getting the second prices over the Korea. I used this experience to enter KAIST. If I had decided to study instead of the contest, I would not be here in KAIST.
        In conclusion, taking risks or chances is more likely to give higher possibility to succed than careful planning. People might not have enough time to plan everything, and unpredictable events gives more experiences. "	4.5	4	4	12.5
822	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"     Recently, there has been a growing interest in things that can earn ""Strike it rich"", such as stocks and bitcoin. It is thought that this is a reflection of the trend of modern society that people want to make big money through risk without effort. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that many people are at a loss. That is, success does not come from risk or opportunity alone, but attention comes from planning and effort.
     First, efficient work is essential for success, which is impossible without careful planning. If you work without a plan, you wil not be able to check your current status, and you may experience unhappiness, such as redoing what you are doing. You can also think about your future dreams while making a plan, which will help you motivate and make you reach your goals efficiently. For example, many teachers in schools recommend writing a study planner when studying forthe same reason, and many labortories at KAIST use tools such as Google Calendar to efficiently schedules. 
     Second, even those who seem to have succeeded by luck have hidden efforts behind them. A swan swimming on a lake looks very graceful, but the swan's feet moving under the lake move very quickly, not at all. This story is a famous fable, and it teaches people that success seems easy on the surface, but there is a lot of hard work behind it. I recently interviewed the developer of Korea's biggest delivery application. In an interview, he said that he wasn't even a programming major, but he could become the current top developer with twice as much planning and effort as others. In this case also show that planning efforts make success. Moreover, In order to be prepared when the opportunity to succeed comes, you need to make a plan ahead of time to make yourself a successful person. 
     Many people dream of success, but very few succeed. This means that success can only come with the support of not only luck, but also planned effort. If you want to be successful, make a plan and implement it right now. A golden future will come to you. "	4	4	4	12

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Newspapers tends to show challenge backgrounds when they introduce some famous people. Why they do like this? The main result is famous people seem to overcomes those situations and grow dramatically. However, some youth are scared risks and appear to go to only careful plannings. In this situation, I think they should be more strong and try to take risks or chances to succeed in life.
     Fist of all, people who exprience risks can learn methods to overcomes. The process to take planning may supply meaningful experiences; however, the process of overcoming challenges would become imporessive memory. It would help people find their own ways to fight against risks, then they can use these methods to succeed in life. Thus, challenging with such risks would show new ways to win in life.
     The second reasons is that letting risks or chanes in life would let people become positive. People may experience that they chose the right answer although they just selected numbers randomly in test. In this situation, if they enjoy their life without careful plaaning, they feel happy and memory that day as successful moment. However, some who think that success only comes from predictable plans would feel uncomfortable and doubt those lucky. As a result, believeing success is unpredictable will make people get energy with even small successful experiences.
     Finally, planning tends to finite various oppoortunies to try. If people always plans their days to make effective and successful days, they may get pressure to complete all of them. This pressure can limit diverse possible success. On the other hand, people doing works without specific plans can gather infinite opportunity to try, then this attitude will make easy to access to success. Therefore, planning complex methods can disturb for success in life, while people take planning to succeed effectively.
    To summarize, letting more free to get successful memories would provide ways to overcomes and make people more active. In addition, planning could limit potential possible to succeed. In conclusion, while specific planning seems to introduce right ways to succeed, risks or chances are more effective to make memorable success in life."	3.5	4	3	10.5
824	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Some people might say that we should plan carefully and be ready for our future. For some aspects, this can be true with its stability for long-term goals. However, we can't win big and move forward if we miss the chances due to the fearness of risk and failing. In my opinion, taking risks or chances  in life is more successful than planning carefully with these 2 reasons: High rewards, the improvement of fluent working  and the limit of chances.
     To begin with, most of the chances with some risks also have high rewards. Work with high risks might seems to be dangerous and difficult to handle. However, there waits high rewards for people who can indure those risks. Giving an example, think of a situation that you are a college student who wants to listen to a famous professor's lesson. Although you know that many participants will apply for that lesson, the advantages of the lesson is great. The professor will teach students with passion and give good grades, which can make your university life more easy and convenient. For this situation, you should try applying even if there are some chances that you can fail. The rewards overwhelm the disadvantages. This is why avoiding risks without searching for them is not recommended and is unefficient.
     On top of that, you can also improve your fluently working ability. There will be lots of unseen and unpredictable obstacles that can surprise and disturb your work. For instance, the homework duration can be shortened due to the sudden change of your schedule, and this can ruin your homework plan. Then, the thing you should do is to change the plan and make a new schedule. In this case, you can adapt to the sudden change quicly and efficiently if you have experienced the same situations before. In other words, experiencing various risks and chances can improve your working ability to fluently re-schedule. Not only that, there also exist limitation of the chances. The chances don't wait for those whom are not ready for them. You have to make the chances into your results when they come to you. From the chances to pick your dinner to the chances to pick your lifetime career, you should be ready for them. This is why you the experience of choosing and taking risks is important.
     To sum up, risks and chances would be more successful choice than safe and careful planning with the aspects of rewards and limitation of chances in life. There will be many choices in our life, and there does not exist a perfect decision for them. However, the risks are the thing we should always be prepared. With these reasons I recommend you to take risks and chances in life."	5	5	4.5	14.5

      Have you ever hope to become a president or CEO of a huge company? Most people are living with a dream of success in life. In my case, I have a dream of become  a top engineer in Samsung and a professor of KAIST. Eager of success makes people to work hard and try their best. Since the success requires talent and luck, some people believe that success just comes from taking chances. However, in reality, those chances  comes to a person who is ready to take chances and have speific plans. In my point of view, I think success in life comes from careful planning because of these reasons.

     First of all, careful plans makes people to prepare for the future and take chances  effectively. People who have plans are doing something that may help them in the future. For example, when I was 13, I have a dream of become an top engineer in a big company. Then  I plan to go to KAIST and major Electornical engineer.  To achieve it, I studied middle school math and science to get good score at middle school. Due to my hard work. I got good score in middle school. Thanksfully, I have a chance to go to good highschool that is appropriate for me to go to KAIST. I also try my best at highschool especially in science and math and finally, I went to KAIST. I have a future plan to get 3.7 grade in average and go to Samsung. I agree that success can come from taking chances. However, the point is that only the person who is prepared can utilize that chances effectively. In my case, as I got good grade  in middle school, I was able to go to a good high school. If I didn't study hard, I could not go to that highschool and I might be really hard to come to KAIST. Specific plans will helps people to prepare for chances.

     In addition, specific plans will help people to fasten the success. Some people just wait for chances and luck to success. I agree that very small percent of people can success in that way. However, in reality, most people cannot success fast in that way. If people have plans, they will prepare things and take our effort to success.  Just following the plans, the possibility of success goes higher and the time of success will be fasten. For example, in my case,  I have specific plan to become a top engineer in Samsung. Therefore, I will major Electronical engineering and search lots of things to achieve it. This kind of effort will help me to go to Samsung faster than others.

    In conclusion, success in life require specific and careful plans. If people have a dream of success, all they have to do is make plan and follow it.  "	5	5	4	14
826	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"How can we tell someone is succeeded or not? Nowadays, usually people tell that if someone earns money a lot, it is believed as succeeded. There are other points about succeeded life like the work-life balance or the person likes the work. However, if we cannot earn money to live confortably, even though we are doing the work we like, people usually thinks that we are not succeeded. Then, what is the similarity of the richest people in the world? They are usually entrprenuer or the invester such as Woren Fupit or Bill Gates. Theses people takes risks and catches the chances; therefore, to have success in life, I think taking risks or chances is more powerful than careful planning.
     First, the richest people in the world are usually entreprenuers and people in this job usually takes risks and catch the chances. Entreprenuers always endure the risk of failing. If they invest something wrong, the company suddenly can go down. On the other hand, if they success in the R&D, they can earn money  hundreds or thousands times of money they invested at first. ""High risk high return"" I think  this phrase shows well of our economy. To be success in life, we have to find the chance and bet where to go. It can be small things like choosing the company to work or selecting the subject to master. The company that people are working may end up firing the empolyers while other company may succeed and give thier empolyers  a lot of money. There are always risks and chances around us and choosing the right opportunity can make us to success in life.
     Second, the perfect plan have no meaning it is not accomplished. Many people should have a memory that they planned a prefect plan in the new year, but they end up doing nothing, fail to do what they planned. As you see, planning what to do and doing something is totally different thing. The plan may fail even though we consider all of the probabilities in our life. I think doing something is more important than just planning. If we work on something, someday the chances come and catching this is ciritcal. We can find it in almost all of the famus people beleives as 'Succeeded person' such as Ambraham Lincon, Oprah Winprey. There are always 'turning point' in the life, and choosing the chance with taking risk makes us to success.
     Third, the carefully planned plan is not perfect than we think. In my experience, what I always felt about the plan is that it is not useful than people think. For example, I planned to do study English today is okay but if I plan to study English page 100 to 120, then suddenly, I get the assingmnet that is due to tomorrow. Then, I have no choice to not finish the whole pages I planned. Detailed plan makes people nervous. If we fail to finish the plan, it makes us think like we did something wrong even though we didn't do anything wrong.  We cannot know what will happen so every plan may be revised. On the other hand, as I explanined in the example, I chose to do the assignment than studying English. Like this, we have to take risk and chances becuase there is no perfect plan.
   To sum up, I think to success in life, we have to take riskes and chances because of three reasons; the richest people in the world takes the risks and catch the chances, the plan can be not accomplished as we planned, and there is no perfect plan in life. Living hard and doing what we have to do will make us the chances and if we catch the chance with taking the risk, the choice can make us to succeed in life. "	4	3.5	3.5	11
827	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"     There are many kinds of success in the world. It can be earning plenty of money, having a good social status, or it might be just being happy. There are also different ways to be successful in life. Some think that it comes from taking risks or chances, and others think that it results from careful planning. What I agree with is that success comes from careful planning. There are three different reasons to support the opinion, which are that there is no answer for the success, the chances come from the planning, and the plans provide the guideline toward the success.
     First reason is that there is no certain answer for the success. Like the first sentence in the essay, what people think of the success is different for everyone. Some might think the noticable accomplishment is the only success, but others might think that the small happiness can also be a kind of success. Therefore, some of the success might not require risks to achieve. Instead, since everyone will have some personal opinion about the success, having a careful plan toward their own goal will be necessary. Waiting for the chances to come with just thinking about the success will not lead them to the successful path. For example, some people can think of success as a ""successful relationship with others."" In this situation, taking risks or chances are actually not required for their ""success."" Instead, careful plans of their actions and behaviors toward the people around them will be highly recommended for their true ""success."" In another case, some people might think of their success as a noticable accomplishment. However, there is no destination with only one path. Therefore, taking risks can be a good way to be successful, but it should be aware that these are not necessary, but carefully planning will be necessary in most of the cases.
     Second reason is that chances come from planning. Chances are surely one of the best opportunities for people to advance to the higher level. However, grabbing those chances are not that easy, and the plans must be the base of it. There is a phrase saying ""Prepared one can grab a chance."" This indicates that whatever chance comes to people, they can't grab it unless they are prepared for it. Therefore, planning for the success must be the first step to the success, and chances are things that people can expect as the second step toward the success.
     Last reason is that plans can provide the right path to the success. There must be some risks or chances during the way to the success. There can't be no risk. In these situations, it is impossible to clearly say that everyone will successfully handle their risks. Then, people are likely to be lost in their path to the success. What is important in this situation is the plans. Planning doesn't contain only the steps to the destination.. Instead, people think about some variations and other situations that might happen. All of these will provide the guideline for people who can be lost in their way by the failure to the risks.  For example, some people might have failed some missions which should have been done according to their plans and the extra time formed unfortunately. They might get frustrated about what to do, but they can check and slightly change the plan by doing other steps that they can do in this extra time, when they have done the careful planning already. If there is nothing to do, then they can think about another plan that can lead them faster toward the success.
     Careful plans are mostly necessary for the success because there is no certain answer for the success, chances can be grabbed with planning, and plans provide guidelines. Taking risks and chances are not unnecessary, and they are also helpful for taking the success, but plans will be more necessary because this will be the base form of the every step while pursuing the success."	5	5	5	15
828	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Is your life's goal to succeed? Then, you may have seen a lot of theories and books about how to succeed. Among them, some arguments that success in life comes from taking risks or chances exist. They say challenge and overcoming the risk is unevitable process to succeed. However, it is quite doubtful to push us to a dangerous way. Is it real that taking a risk is necessary? It is not. For some reasons, success is a result of careful planning.
     First, plans can reduce the probability of failure. People who believes that success is a result of taking risks challenge to something although success is not sure. In many cases, they fail eventually. This is the main reason why plans are necessary to success. For example, if someone wants to start a business, he or she must take a look at the market and figure out what kind of products or services is popular. After that, calculation of how much resources would be needed should be in process. If he or she do a business without these steps and plans, the business might fail.
     Second, chances comes to the one who are prepared. Risk takers often say that when the chance comes, they would not miss it. However, if chances don't come to risk takers, their confidence is useless. Planning and preparing for future can increase the probability of chances. For instance, imagine a student who is 19 years old. If student passes a first step of entrance exam of university that is higher than his or her grades, but didn't make a plan and prepare for it, he or she never make it because other students who made plans would be more prepared. People who steadily keep trying and preparing have a bigger chance to success.
     In conclusion, people who want to succeed in any field should make a plan carefully. It prevents us from failure and help us not to miss chances. So, careful planning is the key of success."	3.5	4	3.5	11

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"How should we live our life in order to success? Some people plan their daily life. Others try to face various occurrence whether it is good or bad. However, taking risks enable various experience and avoid depression. Success in life comes from taking risks or chances rather than careful planning.
      Firstly, behavior enjoying risks can get us various experiences. If we try to avoid attempts that can cause bad results, the frequency and number of new experiences will decrease. The things that can make us better may not occur, too. For my example, my senior once called me to come to a hiphop club at saturday night. I was bit concerned about corona virus, drugs and etc. However, my life moto is to face many things and go many places as I can. Therefore, I directedly went to the club at 3am. What I did was definitely great. I felt the joy and passion from bumming music and people dancing, which I have never felt before. As a result, I figured out who I am, and joined the kaist cheerleading club, ELKA. If I haven’t been to the club at the night because of several concerns of mine, my school life wouldn’t be successful as now. Enjoying risks make exciting memories that can develope our life. 
      Next, daily life that is planned and prepared can cause serious depression. If we plan what to do tomorrow, next week, we may efficiently use our time. However, we can feel ourselves like a robot which does the tasks that are given. For instance, I went to the academy this spring to prepare the exam for attending medic school. I did my language, math, science study for 8am to 11pm everyday. All of the schedule was fixed and I was gloomy all the time. 20 is the age that we can do numerous activities like going on a trip, date a girlfriend, learn new sports, etc. The truth that I was just doing the tasks what I should do maked me so depressed in order to change my characterisitics. My mom says I was such a quite and lonely boy that time. Depressed mood cannot make succesful results. 
     To sum up, the think to enjoy risks makes our life happy. Living a happy life is such a succesful life. In order to succes, facing lots of bad and good occerence is neccessary.     "	4	5	4	13
830	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Avoiding risk and hazard is powerful strategy to survive. Similarly, we can prevent occurring big troubles in the society by being watchful. However, that not means 'successfulness'. I agree with success in life comes from taking risks or chances for three reasons.
  First, huge achievements always follow risks. Some scientists and mathemeticians spent their whole life to ascertain a phenomenon or prove a formula. Some people can think it foolish, but it is true that they managed to change their world by taking a risk of abandoning their whole life. No Novel Prize winner did not took risk. 
  Second, taking risk makes people more successful in the future. Whether a person succeed one of risky task or not, he or she can develop their skill from this experience. As a result, he or she would be more likely to be successful in the next time.
  Finally, it is nearly impossible to not take risk during entire lifespan. We will live as long as about 80 years, we have to encounter uncertainty although you do not want. Uncertainty includes from prize event quiz to recruitment of the company. Ironically, we have won against these uncertainties which have risk. Even monotonous life takes small risk and successes every day.
    We have to take risk to not only be successful but also be stand in the society."	3	3	3	9
831	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Everyone wants to make a success in life, and people work, bear the hard circumstances, find someone to lean on, and sometimes sacrifice for others to reach to the standard of the success they made themselves. Accordingly, how to succeed differs from each person. Many CEOs or others famous people say that people need to take risks or get the important chance, which would change their lives. On the other hand, others say that what people should do is taking care of all the problems and making detailed plans for future. Actually both of them are important in life, as many succeeded people similarly suggest the ways. But in my opinion, more important thing to have a successful life is making a careful plan. There are three main reasons why people have to make plans rather than take risks.

     At first, making plans are the basic and necessary thing to do if someone doesn't want to waste time. In other words, making plans let us not to spend time in unnecessary things. In our lives, the immediate decisions people make are not always the correct answers. Not only when they think about the long future and consider about the jobs or many big events in life but also think about the everyday life like how to go to workspace, they have to plan. And without planning , it usually leads to wasting time because most of the people want to rest, play or not doing anything in natural. Sometimes playing or having a rest is needed, but when they occupy too many part of people's life, they wouldn't succeed.

     Secondly, taking risks are literally have many possibility of get failed. In people's life, there are many opportunities and chances and also many risks. However, they don't always lead people to the bright future. Why people think that it would make them succeed is that they have only seen the successful lifes, succeeded people who take chances appropriately. And since the others who failed because of they took risks or chances inapproapriately don't say others to take chances, people don't realize that it would make their life worse than now. Not grabbing the chances only make the situation same, but if you take the risks appropriately, it would make critical consequences in your life.

     Lastly, situations that would become better by planning, considering for long time is more than situations that people should decide quickly and take chances. For example, getting a marriage is one of the success in the life. But without planning whom to marry and when to marry, people would not have a successful marriage. If people want to succeed, they must decide the important things before, and do the things in proper time and place. Comparably, is there a situation or a thing which should be done without plan? The fact that people do not have disadvantages because of their plan, is the reason people should make plans itself.

     In conclusion, people should plan for their lives rather than just waiting for the chances without plans. Because not planning would make people waste their time, they should make the detailed plans and taking risks are too dangerous for most of the people. Also, there are many situations that people must plan before for the situation. So to have a successful life, people have to make plans carefully. Happiness, chance and success will come to people who is ready and always have plans for the futures."	4	3.5	3.5	11

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Some people say that attendance check for classes should  not be neccesary. However, in my opinion, obligation for attendance is important part of class.  There are two reason why students should take part in the class. To briefly mention, they can discuss with peer and get more practical information through real time class. 
To begin with,  they can discuss a lot with their peer through participation. Discussion is very effective way to improve own knowledge or skill. By discussing with the student who have either same idea or different idea, people can retreive their idea and get a better understanding about it. However, if someone don't attend a class, he or she cannot have this process. For example, in my case, I took three major class at 2021 fall semester. Although two of them had mandatory instruction for attendance, the other did not. For that class, many students tended not to attend a class which makes it impossible to have a discussion session with peer due to the lack of students even the professor had a plan to have many discussion time. Finally, it turns out that the understanding about the class having non-mandatory attendance is not fully accomplished than the other classes for me and other students.  Therefore, attending a class is important to have discussion section.
Secondly,  students can get more pratical information through attendance. There are many classes that is for improve practical skills such as experimental class. In this case, doing something with someone's own hand is very important. Without attendance, they cannot practive these things sufficiently and it means they deviate from the purpose of the class. For instance, I can give my experience about it. One year ago, I took a class named 'material science and engineering experiments 1'. Although I participated every class with no exception, It is impossible to practice 'real experiment' because we took the course only via the zoom meeting. Therefore, we didn't have any option but to watch a video about experimental process. At that time, I thought that I got a sufficient understanding about experiment and I could conduct it too. However, after I enter the laboraty for my own research, It turns out that all the knowledge I got from the document are not applicable to real experiment directly. I was short of real experience. Of course, this is my experience for the situation that I couldn't attend face to face class which means that it is bit different from not attending a class, It has same consequence that not to have a real practice is critical to fail the class purpose. Therefore, attendance is important.
To sum up, students should attend a class to have a better understanding about the subject through peer discussion and to get a practical understanding about the class. For these reasons, I think obligation for attendance is highly recommendable."	3.5	3.5	4	11

"I believe that university students should be required to some attend classes but not entire attend classes. 
To check attendence of students who take that classes helps students to join their classes constantly. It is why I believe checking  attendence is useful to make students concentrate their classes. But I think I is unneccesery to force students take all of classes. Sometimes, there are some many reasons -sick, period, or other big event- cause hard to join classes. So students are may suggested to attend most of calsses and it will be helpful to improve their knowledge. Of cause, some students are very smart so they even already know entire subjects of their classes before it was started. But I think to attend calsses is still useful. It help  constantly remind knowledge so students are barely forget what they know. "	1.5	2	2.5	6
835	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Some people think that university students can have a freedom to choose whether they are willing to attend in class. However, it is more preferable to attend class regularly because students can be educated efficiently and also students can find their talents with ease.
To begin with,  students who have gotten education regularly will comprehend information easily. If students have absence several classes in one subject, they would probably not get information for understanding enoughly. Moreover, it is possible for students to get biased and misleading knowledge, too. This will make their score lower and disturb their dream. For example, my cousin had attended for a fundamental mathematic class in KAIST for 6 months. The problem was that he didn't attend class regularly, so when he had a middle exam, he had no idea for solving any problems and got very low score. He regretted for his laziness and started to be educated regularly. As a result, at the final exam, he could get more higher score than his middle exam, so he could avoid F. This experiences  tell us that attending classes regularly can make students understand information readily.
On top of that, students can seek their true talents easily. Students who attend classes every time can understand the main topic and details perfectly. If they do this in all of various classes that they listen, they will recognize the most interesting and funniest topics for them.  These topics could be their real talents for working. A study conducted by the Institute of Education in South Korea illustrates this. Researchers conducted an experiment with 100 successful workers who have talents in their workplace. Researchers asked them about the main reason that they could find their real talents. Overwhelming 80% of workers answered that attending every classes regularly leaded them to their talents and success. This means that attending classes will get many people to succeed.
To sum up, students should be required to attend classes because they can get lots of information with ease. Moreover, they can search their talents and select their jobs. In this regard, I firmly believe that university should restrict their students to attend classes regularly."	3.5	4	4	11.5
836	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I think university students should participate in class. There are three reasons. Before explaing the reasons I want to ask one question. Why are students going to university? If you think of this answer, you will see why students should participate the class. First, the university is optionally going to learn something of higher curriculum. It is not duty education. Of course, every country, whether the high school curriculum is dermatological, but it has the characteristics that the learning is basic and everyone can learn. After that, students will determine their career or major and support a deep study in universities. It is not essential to go to university, and it doesn't have a problem that not going to university. Students who go to the university will be obliged to faithfully depend on college for 4~5 years. Because they chose a university to learn.
The second is that university classes are not free. I think university classes are a kind of contract. The school is an obligation to select excellent potential students and provide good quality education. Students have a duty to pay for university and to be faithful to education. In the case of many university students in Korea, they pay from 5 million won to 10 million won for a year during university. If students are selectively listening to classes, it is likely to not be able to properly use expensive cost.
Finally, students lack the ability to what are they truly needed for themselves in classes. For example, KAIST has a subject called 'Nano Material Technology' in Material Science and Engineering department. In this class, students will learn various nano-based technologies. Because the topic will be changed once a week, if student attend the class optionally, they wouldn't know what topic is more important and hard to learn. Therefore they can't study perfectly in this course. 
Based on this three reasons, I think that university students should be required to attend classes. There will be a variety of opinions, but I'm sure that  we will find answer for thinking why we go to the university."	3	3	3	9
837	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I agree that university students should attend classes. First of all, university is the place for education and academic research. Each professor is an expert in their field and has deep knowledge and abundant experiences that students hardly access by themselves. Therefore, professors try to deliver their knowlegde and experience in more efficient ways to their students. However, if a student refuse to attend the class, it means that student has nothing to do with professors. If a student is really interested in his major, he has no reason not to attend classes where he is able to get as much as knowledge and information he wants.
Some might argue that classes which are not associated with their major might not be helpful for their career, thus taking it granted for not attending those classes. It is true that all classes we take during the university course are not relavant to our career. However, those classes may extend our perspective and allow an unexpected experience. For example, Steve jobs took a caligraphy class during his undergraduate, which seemed not that relavant to his major. However, that class impressed him to develop the concept of font on computer, which has been evaluated as one of the innovations of computing field. Likewise, even though some classes seem not that meaningful for us right now, it would be helpful in our career or at least our way of living someday.
On top of that, for those whose major is science and technology, they have to learn and practice experimental techniques as well as advanced knowlegde. That's what experiment classes are for. During the classes, we can learn how to handle an equipment and instrument and get familiar to experimental protocols. These can only be obtained when doing and experincing in direct. If a student refuse to attend these classes, he has no way to learn those skills.
In this regard, I assert that university students should participate in classes."	3	3.5	4	10.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"In my opinion, universtity students doesn't need to be  required to attend class. I will explain it with 2 reasons.
First, thanks to some technology, we can learn knowledge without realtime class. Because of COVID-19, a lot of universities, companies, and programmers prepared some systems to take class online. And with this online class system, attending class on time is no more needed. Students can just listen to the recorded class, and do some programmed exercises or quizes. If recorded classes are not enough to understand whole lecture, then we can just prepare Q&A systems or talk-to-professor sessions.
Second, university class is not duty. Duty for learning is finished when students graduate high schools. And students take university classes if they want. Checking attendance system is needed for some students who do not want to attend in required classes (classes which have duty to listen), so it will not be needed no more for the university classes. I'm sure that students who HOPE to listen university classes will do all the requirements for the classes even they are not attended classes on time.
Although formal type of classes are requiring to attend classes on time, the world has evaluated to be enough to take classes without real time attendance. And university students have enough rights to choose the way they learn. I suggest to make university classes' attendances optional for students, and trust that university students can learn without attendance checking."	3	3.5	3	9.5

     In generally, university students pay for the classes and the price is pretty high. Therefore, if students do not take the classes the money they pay for the classes becomes useless. 
     Also, I think the purpose of the university is improving the knowledge level of students. If students do not take the classes, then how they learn or experience new knowledge? 
     To sum up, university is the place for learning and payment for enlisting is not cheap. For these reasons, I think the classes are heavily necessary for the university students."	1.5	1.5	2	5

"As an undergraduate student, I have expierenced lots of professors with very different class policies, and I believe that going to classes should be optional for student. 
First the class atomshpere would be better, if we only have self-motivated student.  As a student, my personal experience from the class which does not require attendance is actually better, because people are not afraid of asking questions with small amount of people, and I am also easily motivated by the enthusiatic professor and student. Besides, professor would not willing to watch the sleepy students from class, and it can badly affect the class quality, 
Second, pre-recored videio is easier to manage time not only for the student and but also for the professor. There are several reasons that someone might wants to have the class at the other time. If we are not able to attend a class on time, it is always better to have a backup plan. Student might also have various style of learning - someone might have better result from taking the lecture, but also someone might tends to read the text book rather than listening to professor. 
Last but not least, checking and maintaing the attendance score for everyone spend plenty amount of time . It can be a burdern for teaching assistnant and professor, and I firmly blieve that thoes time and effort should be saved for having class with better quality. 
There are always tradeoff to have one distinct rule for everything, and from the above reasons, I believe having flexible attedance policy would help instructor and student to maintain a better quatlity of class."	3	4	3.5	10.5

In university, in general, most of classes check students attendance, but few don't. Many professors think student must attend all classes, but I have different oppinion. Student can choose they will attend the class or not. There are three reasons. First, students have abilities to decide. Second, it would increase quality of lectures. 
 First, students in University are adults, and  they have responsibility ro decide their attendance. They are all adults and they know what would happen after they absent on class such as sufferring on studying or getting lower grades.  I think student must learn how to response on their choicese in University.
 Second, some students who attend the class by forces may disturb the class. There are some students who sleep, talk, and even play games. These can interupt students who are willing to listen lecture. So, it is better to not force students to come to class, and let some students can abscent on the class.
 For these reasons, I believe attending to classes should be optional for university students."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

The first reason is that students can obtain high level information in the class. Some people can say that the information is also listed in the textbook and by reading a book, students can get that knowledge. However, not every students can do such things by their own. Some students can achieve high level techniques with helpers.
The second reason is that in the lecture, students can interact with other students. They can exchange their ideas with other friends and can solve difficult problems that can not be solved by the students alone. The classes are not the place for transfering knowledges. Students can learn many things in the classes.
In this article, I suggested 2 reasons why the students should be required to attend classes. By attending classes, students can learn valuable lesson for their lives."	3	2.5	2.5	8

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"This debate intensified as non-face-to-face lectures became more active due to COVID-19
In my opinion university students don’t have to participate in class. 
I’ll explain three reasons why we should do that.


First, It is important for us to learn in university, but we can find and study what we need on our own.
We don’t have to learn by someone’s coercion as you did when you were a student before entrance the university.
We are now adults and can plan and design our own careers.

Second, Most professor’s lectures are not cramming lectures like high school or middle school teachers.
Professors explain only the necessary parts and don’t prepare lectures to make all students understand.
We eventually need self-study time to understand the lectures.
For example, in high school or middle school teacher identified and guided each studnet’s level, but professor is our colleagues and seniors. 
Rather than wanting to lead, we should ask for what we want.

last, We now our level and know how to study.
It is inefficient to listen to learn what you already know again.
It is more helpful to learn about your unknown parts seperately at that time.
Listening just what you need is much more efficient. 

Of course, the prerequisite for this argument is that there are situations in which self-studying is possible.
Lazy students who can’t learn by themseleves be forced to participate in class.
However, most university students are adults and have to take resposibility for their lives.
You should be free to participate in class, but you pave to pay for the results yourself. "	3	3	3	9

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" The university students are adult, so some people might think that their attendance should be optional. They think that passing class or grading class should be just depends on their scores, not attendance. However, attendance is one of the most important parts of class and I think it should be required with following reasons.
 First, classes are conducted by not only professors, but also students. It is difficult for professors to know student’s level perfectly. For example, they may skip lessons which learned in preceding classes, and students have difficulties in understanding. Communicating is a key solution for these situations. Students may ask for clarification of the part they do not understand. 
 Next, it is hard to evaluate students without participation for some classes, such as athletic class in KAIST. For example, the class ‘healthy campus life’, which aims to increases students’ health for running campus, is impossible to grading students without participation. The major objective of these classes is steadiness, so attendance must be most important evaluation factor.
 To sum up, students should also work hard to organize the class and achive the purpose of the classes. That’s why attendance and participation of students should be required."	3.5	3.5	3	10
845	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" Some students think that the attend the class is not important. They say that the class and lecture are not different with their own studies and they can get all information in their textbook. However, the textbook is not enough to cover all of the lecture.  In university, there are many type of the classes. One types are hearing the professor's lecture and other types are the taking with classmate and making something for the class project. Each gives lots of contents while we take the class. I will explain the reason why the each types lecture is helpful.

 First  type is the hearing type class. In this class, they can learn how the theory conducted and how to solve the real type problem by using it. While the professor tell that things for giving information, they try to tell the easy way for student's understanding. These things are easier than the textbook because the textbook just show what the theory is and get less infomation about how to conduct this. In conclusion, the hearing lecture type is helpful for students understanding.

 Second type is the project type which is objecting to make final result for class. There are lots things which can't learn in the texbook or their own studies.  In class, students have to talk with their classmate for asking others opinions. In this procedure, they can get the skills for effective way for communicating. This skill is unique because this can't improve without communicate. After communication with classmate, they have to make somethings and present what we did in class to other classmate. This make them know optimizing the work and the effiecent way for providing the infomation. All of these skill can't get their own study.

 As we seen above, the class give lots of benefits. The class can give the easy why to apporach the theories by professor's lecture. Also, the class can give the unique skills like communication, optimizing, and presentation skills which can't get without the attending class. In these reason I think attending class is required for improvement of the student's skills. "	3	3	3.5	9.5

If attendance is required, students will have to go to classes even if they don’t want to. This will make them more diligent, and make them more used to going somewhere same every day, which will be required when they graduate and go to work, labs and etc.. Also, they can learn contents of the course fully because they attended it. One can think that ‘If they want to learn, they will come to classes on their own will, so attandence can be optional’, but by giving some restriction about attendance will give more motivation to go to classes, and will result in some ‘not very emthusiastic students’ to learn well. Finally, I think proffesors will prefer many students showing up(I am no professor, so not 100% sure about this), rather then few, and checking attendacne will probabily make more studets to show up. For these reasons, I think that attendance have to be required. "	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

Some of them may says it should not be forced, 
but even they know it is actually required. Here are some reasons that we have to attend classes.


First of all, one of the most important duty of the students is understanding lectures. To do so, not only just looking at the book is enough,
but also ask questions to professors is needed. No one can understand the knowledge of all courses through the textbook only. We should
dicuss with others, and actually it is hard to do spontaneously without attending classes. Therefore, in terms of the duty of the students, 
attending classes should be required.


Furthermore, attending classes is related to respect professors. Imagine no one has attened to the classes, while professor prepared the lecture
a lot. Since teaching is not his main job,  it is quite rude actions if we don't attend the classes.  I think everyone will agree that university which
professors are not respected cannot be major university.  If so, to prevent honor of the university, paying respect to professors via attending classes
should be required.

Finally, for students' life cycle, attending classes can affect positively. University students are easy to wake up at afternoon and sleep at the morning 
because of their homeworks and projects. This is very bad to their health and hard to turn back. However, if they have to attend the classes, they will
manage their schedule and sleep at least few hours. Even though it is not the best, this is an optimum between their health and duty of students.
So, to manage students' health, forcing students to attend classes is a good way.

To sum up, students should be required to attend classes for not only students' health and study, but also professors and universities' honor.  "	3	3.5	3.5	10

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Nowadays, many university classes require that students should attend on classes. University students should be required to attend classes for 2 reasons. 
  First of all, going to classes should be optional may be able to leads that students miss the significant contents of class. The main idea from people who claim that going to classes should be optional  is that studnets can judge what class is important to them or not. So, they want to attend the class by their own judgement. However,  many university class subject is contained by difficult contents of the class. Through this, they could be possible misjudging the importance of the contents of the class. It is the main reason why we learn the major subject in the university and professor teach the students.
  Lastly, attending class is able to make students can get the significant information and knowhow about the class from professor and other students. Finding the important context in the text book or internet alone is very hard to the student who face it first. In this case, the professor can gives the information of the subject what is the crucial point of that or not. Moreover, they can give the additional information over the text book likes which methods is more important and the changed points of the content in recent researchs. Furthermore, in university, there are so many students know well the subject. If students attend the in class then they can communicate with other class students and participate together. Then it leads that they can make synergy for getting the further information about the class by communicating them selves.
  For this reasons, I believe that students should attend university classes. They could learn the important concepts by professor and classmates, and they are not yet learned much more, so it is hart to judge the class is crutial or not."	3	3	3	9
849	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Regarding the opinion that going to classes should be optional for students, I want to claim the opposite opinion. University students should attend the classes, not optionally. There are lots of reasons but I will mention crucial ones. First of all, the reason why someone takes a class offered by university is because that someone has little knowledge about the topic that course offers, and so he (or she) wants to know more. University usually gives students a freedom for choosing the classes they want to take, so if someone doesn't have anything to learn in one course, that person should not take the course. Rather. that person should choose the other ones, and take the courses sincerely. Second, attending a class has a meaning of respect to a professor or lecturer. The people who give us a lecture usually have some high-level knowledge and do their research. They come to university and teach us even though they lose their time for research. If attending a class becomes optional and the most of the students don't arrive at the classroom, lecturer will be very frustrated, not motivated. So, attending a class has a meaning of showing our respects for them.  Before concluding my arguments, I want to give some analogy. We might be very angry when our professor expected to give us a lecture doesn't come to a class. In a same manner, If many students don't come to attend a class,  it is natural for the lecturer to be very sad about that. So, why don't we attend a class sincerely, and get some interesting knowledge and also a virtue of our life, respect?"	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

     Students are usually suffer from burdensome studying during the semesters. Therefore, many countries provide educational system that gives some vacations between the semesters. Some argue that one long vacation is  better than several short vacations throughout the year. However, in my opinion, many short vacations are better than long vacation for several reasons.
     First of all, students can rest at various seasons if they have several short vacations. Every season has unique property; for example, beautiful beaches are available on summer, but skiing is only available in winter. Therefore, if there is one long vacation each year, it is impossible for students to enjoy each seasons. Some students may like summer than winter, but the other students may like winter than summer. In this case, one side is obliged to give up their favorite season. Therefore, it is recommendable to have several short vacations at each seasons. 
     Second of all, students can relieve their stresses more often. Relieving stresses is one of the main purpose of having vacation. Stresses tend to not only be accumulated but also explode if they cross the 'limitation line'. Although 'limitation line' for individual is different for each people, it is obvious that one should relieve the stresses before they cross the line. Therefore, periodic relieving is important for people. If someone can only have one long vacation, stresses would be accumulated throughout the whole year without relieving them; It may result serious problem. Hence, it is better to have several short vacations for students.
     Some argue that short vacations are not enough to experience many things; for example, part-time jobs or long trip. However, this view is not correct.  Although they are shorter than one long vacation, they usually exceed 1 month per vacation. Indeed, it is sufficient time to experience many things. Considering the fact that some part time jobs and trip usually require 1 months or less, students can do the things they wanted to do if they schedule the vacation deliberately. 
     To sum up, several short vacations are better than one long vacation because of the issues with respect to stress relieving, seasonal enjoying, and time-consuming experiences. Vacations are only time for students to enjoy their own life. Students would be able to enjoy their life better with many short vacations."	4	3.5	4	11.5

There are many perspective about view of length of vacations. The one of them is whether students should be given one long vacation or several short vacations. Even though each of both examples have their good point, but having several short vacations has more advantage. There are two reasons why students should have several short vacations.
First of all, having several short vacation makes students keep their concentration. For example, in our society, most of people rest in weekend; it gives the chance of recharge. If people nonstop work more than 20 days and rest 8 days in every month, then lifestyle of people are surely ruined by their schedule. Because it is exhausting to work without rest in several week. The case of vacation is also same. Students will be tired if they keep studying through months without short term vacation.
Moreover, having several short vacations avoid forgetting what student learn. The memory of human is disappearing inversely propotional about time. The inversely propotional grape is mostly under the linear grape, so having long vacation means students more forget their knowldge. Therefore, short vacations are more appropriate.
However, some people think that one long vacation is more useful because student can have some different experience without regular education. Despite this fact, mostly several short vacation is still appropriate. students can rest their semester. If a student want to have another experience, then that student can rest one semester. As a result, it is another individual option as same as one long vacation.
In conclusion, student should have several short vacations. It makes students keep their concentration and avoid forgetting what student learn. Although some students need a long term vacation for their need, but they can rest their one semester. Therefore, universities and collages should provide several short vacations for students."	4	3.5	3.5	11

   Having vacations is important for people. Not as an exceptions, students should have vacations for their rest. In the way of having vacation, people argues about which term will be better for students. Someone think that students should be given one long vacation each year, and others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. In this case, short period vacations with multiple times will be better strategy with several reasons.
          First of all, there is a limitation to a person who can focus on their work. The purpose of the vacation is to rest for recharging people's ability of focusing. As the term between each vacations become longer, students can not focus on their work continuously. By making the vacation plans with several short vacations, students can focus on their work with profit work period.
          Second, the reward of their work comes faster. Vacations after works can be considered as a kind of reward. As vacation come closer, students became hopeful that they can get reward about their hard work. They will work hard to get this sweet reward; however, as the terms of vacations become longer, students will be disappointed that they can not get rewards from their work. Short but many vacations will keep students to think that they can get reward from the work, so it will maintain passions of their study.
          Some argues that one long vacation have more advantages, because long term workflow make students became more skillful in their study or work. Long period of work will make students more closer to expert; however, long period of vacation will make students less closer to expert. If a vacation goes too long, students will forget about what they learn. Students should return to their work before they loose the information of their study. With the short vacations, students can come back to their work before they forgot about what they learned.
          To sum up, setting vacation plans with several short times is better than one long vacation each year. The planner of vacations should consider about how long can their students focus on their work, and how much their students are waiting for the rewards. It is also important to think about which amount of rest will not make students forget about their work. Although it is the better choice to have several short vacations, still many schools are having only one long vacation each year. Now it is time to think again about their strategy, and change their plans for students."	4.5	4	3.5	12

     All educational institutions from elementary schools to universities in Korea have vacations. In general, students enjoy a total of two vacations once in summer and once in winter. Some people say that one long vacation is better. In my opinion, however, several short vacations are more helpful to students than one long vacation.
     First of all, students can relax while enjoying various seasons through several short vacations. Students usually spend time resting and traveling on vacation, so several short vacation policies are needed to enjoy various seasons. Short vacations will help students have more diverse and fresh experiences because their preferred travel destinations and food vary from season to season. Several short vacations will allow students to spend a much more colorful vacation.
     Another reason is that student can experience many times, such as interns or individual studies. During several short vacations, students can experience companies of various occupations and laboratories on various research topics, and this experience will be of great help in deciding their careers after graduation. The month to two months of internship or research experience is enough for students to determine if they are suitable for their aptitude; therefore, it is necessary to have time to contact as many places as possible.
     On the other hand, some argue that several short vacations interfere with academic flow; however, several short vacations can improve academic efficiency. If students continue studying for several months, students will get tired and exhausted. At this time, vacation provides energy for students to recover their tired bodies and study efficiently again. The more often students relieve fatigue from studying, the more helpful it is to their studies; therefore, several short vacations are required strongly.
     To sum up, several short vacations are required of students for the following reasons. Students can enjoy various seasons; also, they can do many activities that help them decide their career path. Finally, short vacations help improve academic efficiency."	4.5	4.5	4	13

     Vacation time for students is different in each country, some are short and some are very long. There are still lots of debates on whether students should have one long vacation or several short vacations. In my opinion, students should have one long vacation each year. 
     Firstly, students can learn more about the long vocation. There are lots of students who improve themselves during the summer or winter vacation, such as internships or individual research projects. If students really want to learn something from their project, a longer vacation is mandatory for students to start and finish an actually meaningful project. It is hard to continue the study on the regular semester because students need to focus on the schoolwork during the regular semester, so finishing everything they initially planned throughout the vacation is very important. 
     In addition, students can take an actual break on a long vacation. If the vacation is long, students will have enough time to spend on improving themselves and also some time to take a short break after their own project is finished. Students could not fully enjoy their vacation if it is short, because they need to spend some time on improving themselves, such as learning new languages or applying for internships, and they will never have time to take a rest and jump to the regular semester directly. 
     Some people say that having several short vacations is better because students can get tired of a long semester, but I think having a long semester helps students digest the knowledge they learn from the class and study their major deeply. Class in the university can be divided into intermediate and advanced, and students usually take them throughout 2 semesters because they need the basic information to take some advanced classes.  In this case, the majority of students forget what they learn from last semester so that reviewing is mandatory at the start of the next semester. 
     To sum up, having a long vacation is better for students to learn things better and experience society better. Studying from school is good, however the more important is that students should get to know how to apply what they learn to from the school to the real world, and having a long vacation will give the opportunity to the student to improve their ability.

    Vacations is important for students. Students can rest and do other activities during the vacations. All schools have vacations for their students, but the length and period of vacations different. Some may believe one long vacation is right; however, in my opinion, several short vacations are the best for several reasons.
    For the first reason, students have to rest several periods in a year. Students study a lot during  semester, and they get lots of stress. Students need frequent resting times for lowering their stress and taking care of their mind. Vacations are the only period which they can rest; therefore, several short vacations will help students to rest and recharge.
   In addition to resting, several vacations prevent students to study in hard condition. Summer and winter are too hot and too cold, and some periods contain heavy rain or snow. In those seasons, students can not concentrate on their study due to too low or too high temperature.  They can not take PE classes outside, and they have lots of difficulties on going to school due to the hard weathers. 
   Although some people argue that long one vacation is easier to do other activities, several short vacations are better for those activities.  Benefit of long vacation is that students can do activities with long period; however, it is hard for students to concentrate on long term activities, and number of activities are important for students. With 
    To sum up, students must get several short vacations. With several short vacations, students can rest frequently and study on best conditions. Also, several short vacations are good for students to have various experiences. Several short vacations will improve students' life."	4	3.5	3.5	11

"For students, vacation is essential because many students resist their semester with the hope of the sweet vacation. Without the vacation, students and lecturers will become exhausted, so the efficiency of the class will decrease. Students can do many things during the vacation: studying historic qualification, getting driver license, playing musical instruments. There is an argument that some students would like one long vacation, and other students like short but several vacations. One long vacation is effective to students.
First of all, students can study new things more deeply with a long vacation. During the vacation, lots of students learn new things because they do not have enough time to focus on them in the semester. Therefore, the students need long time to spend. This can be achieved by the one long vacation. By focusing on new field more deeply, students can improve themselves.
Furthermore, many schools repair their facilities during the semester. If some facility need more time to repair or construction schedule is postponed, the repairing should be continued during the semester. Students will not like this situation; indeed, they can not focus on the lectures, too. Therefore, the long vacation is crucial for the schools, too.
Some argue that if one long vacation is given to students, they will forget their last semester works. However, that is totally up to students, and if students want a good grade, they can review their last studies before the new semester. Moreover, as that situation is same to all student, it is not a problem.
To sum up, the long vacation is more efficient to students for their studying. They can focus on their new study area more deeply with a enough time. Also, with a long vacation, the school can have enough repairing time for facilities, so the construction will not affect the study of the students. With those reasons, students can achieve high levels."	4.5	4	4	12.5

     It is a very important opportunity for vacation students to rest and organize their works. There is always a lot of arguments on whether to give a long vacation or a short vacation frequently. Before a dispute, they have to think abouThere are several reasons to give students a few short vacations.
     First of all, several short vacations are efficient. During the vacation, students study English, work as an intern, and prepare for employment. These preparations do not take as much time as expected. Most of the work can be prepared and finished in a short time; furthermore,  if you prepare for a long time, the efficiency is very low. In addition, considering that internship and English tests are often held these days, shorter vacations are needed even more.
     In addition, considering the situations that have occurred these days, it takes time to rest and organize frequently. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, students take classes and engage in outside activities under many restrictions. As a result, they have a lot of difficulties in communication and activities because they cannot conduct academic or work face-to-face with people. At the same time, contact with people has decreased so much that burnouts often come. These days, students should often have a short break to treat their tired minds.
     Some people argue that traveling or experiencing the company they want requires a long vacation. As argued, there are projects or tasks that require a very long time during college life. However, these days, most colleges encourage leave of absence; moreover, do not limit the number or duration of that. It is more efficient to choose a leave of absence that to solve things that require a long time through vacation.
     In conclusion, considering the academic style and lifestyle of students these days, several more short vacations are needed. Above all, frequent vacations are more helpful now when students are concerned about their mental difficulties. Students who are tired of their studies and current situations should organize their minds and do what they have to during the short vacation. Through several short vacations, students will be able to continue their studies without wavering."	4	4	3.5	11.5

     Today, most students study hard and prepare SAT to enter the better university. High-level university guarantees students get preferred jobs such as doctors or judges. For these reasons, some say a college education should be available to all students for equity; however, others did not think like that. Due to the purpose and efficiency of university education, higher education should be available only to good students for several reasons.
     First of all, the major purpose of university education is training students to become good researchers. To achieve this goal, students should learn more knowledge during their class time; however, if there are not-well-educated students, professors should spend much time to explain background knowledge to understand them. For example, teaching plus and minus operators to students in an advanced calculus class is very inefficient. The class requires high background knowledge level.
     In addition to the purpose of training researchers, a university education is efficient in the small-size class. For example, in Advanced English Writing class, the English class in KAIST, professors can give feedbacks to each student for their writing because the size of the class is small. If there are 200 students in each sections, it will be hard to give individual feedbacks. Because the number of professors is limited, forming university to public education system like high school is impossible. Therefore, only the good students should study in the university.
     Some argue that high tution fees of university makes poor students to enter there. They think university should be available for everyone to teach them. However, there are already scholarship system in many universities; therefore, well-educated students can get university education although they are poor. 
     To sum up, admission limitation of the university education has many positive effect. Students can learn complex knowledge with good students and study efficiently with small-size class. That is the reason why the university education is available only to good students."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

             In school, there are many kinds of vacations which students get for the rest because of their busy work. They can get a long vacation each year or can get several short vacations throughout the year. Two kinds of vacations can be effective for the students; however, in my opinion, one long vacation can be more helpful for many students.
             First reason is long vacation can help for preparing the certificates test for getting a job after graduation. Students who are graduate have lots of choices like getting a job, entering graduate school, and so on, but the most case is the getting a job. In that situation, they need to think about the certificates because many certificates can help the student to get the job. Students have to prepare for a long time for the certificates because the test contains many components for studying. It means, students need a long time and a long vacation can help them because it provides students with a long time.
             Second reason is long vacations give time for traveling. In the season, students do not have enough time for travel because there are so many things to do. They have to study the major, work the assignment, and so on. If a long vacation is given to the students, they can get a long time and make the time blank for the traveling. Students can go overseas for travel which they cannot do in the season because of the time issue.
             Some people think that several short vacations can be more helpful because they give lots of rest in the busy season. It may be reasonable for busy people but this cannot be effective. There are so many things to make the result in the season. Almost all of them are long-term projects and they do not end in a short time. In this situation, students cannot rest in the short vacation because of the long-term project; thus, several short vacations do not be effective for resting.
             To sum up, there are two reasons that a long vacation is more effective than several short vacations: preparing the certificates test and traveling. Also, students can use the time more efficiently in the long vacation because they have to work on long-term projects during the season. Students have to consider long vacation for their time management."	4	3.5	3.5	11

     All students attending to universities have their own major. Normally they would only take classes related to their major, but taking classes from other subjects are also possible. Some say that universities should require students to take classes in many subjects. In my opinion, universities have to require students to specialize in one subject. 
     Firstly, knowing fully about just a single topic is hard for university students. The content of university classes is very high-level, so students have to spend immense time to understand it fully; it is difficult to fully master a single topic. If universities require students to take classes from other subjects, they will end up not knowing fully about any subject at all. 
     Secondly, many students are interested in a single subject. Requiring students to take subjects that they are not interested is not only hard for them, but also violates their rights to learn what they want. This will just stress students out, and will cause bad effect on their learning. Also, most students are not that enthusiastic in subjects they are not interested in; they will not pay attention to these classes and only waste their time. 
     Some people say that knowledge from different subjects is required nowadays, so universities should require students to listen to several topics. However, the development of technology is very rapid nowadays, and workers have to know very deeply in a certain field in order to make improvements. Therefore, having shallow knowledge of multiple subjects will make students hard to adopt to the real world.  
     To sum up, universities should require students to specialize a single subject because it is hard for them just to know fully about a single subject, students are normally interested in a single subject, and the society requires experts of a certain field. Forcing them to take classes in many subjects will only make them to work harder, with only minor benefits. "	4.5	4	4.5	13

     There are no students dislike the vacations. If students are in the vacations, they may say long vacations would be better, or if students are in the regular semesters, they want the vacations as soon as possible. Since their desires cannot be satisfied at the same time, they have to choose between one long vacations and several short vacations. These are several reasons that why several short vacations are better.
     First of all, having several short vacations make students to concentrate on studying better. Students constantly lose their concentrations during the semester. Therefore, at the end of semester, most students cannot focus on the lectures. However, if students have several short vacation, students can refresh themselves; therefore, they can concentrate on lectures again.
     Second reason is that having several short vacations is helpful in terms of stress management. By doing homework and projects, students suffer from stress a lot. While doing so, some students may get mental diseases. However, if there are some short vacations between the semesters, students can be free from those stresses. Therefore, students can manage their stress much easier.
     Some may argue that students may lose track of the lectures. Since the semester becomes short, the lectures are also shortened; thus, students may not be able to see entire view of some courses. However, this is not the case. Students can review their courses during the vacation, and since vacations are also short, students can easily remember what they learned in previous semester.
     To sum up, having several short vacations is helpful for students; because, they can concentrate on the courses more. Moreover, students can manage their stress easily, and they can still follow the entire coursework without long semester. Therefore, it is obvious that which policy is better than the others."	4	3.5	3.5	11

 Generally, schools are responsible for creating a conducive environment for students to study. In order for students to help, schools need to consider issues such as giving students one long vacation and several short vacations. Some argue giving students one long vacation is more effective. In my opinion, giving students several short vacations is better for academics for several reasons.
  First of all, short vacations allow students to re-energize their concentration. Many students have a hard time concentrating for long while studying during the semester. In particular, if students use a lot of energy while preparing for exams, it is difficult to keep pace with their studies, and a desire to rest arises. It is difficult to force students to study during this period, so it is necessary to take a short vacation after important exams such as midterm and final to refresh concentration. These short breaks allow students to re-energize their studies and focus well on subsequent lessons.
  Next, students can learn to plan the vacation in several short vacations. Because the vacation given to students is not long, they plan what they will do to make the vacation effective. Also, because vacations are given multiple times, students make not only short-term vacation plans but also long-term plans for how they will spend their upcoming vacations. Moreover, students will learn how to revise their plans, taking into account every moment whether they can meet their long-term plans. Students who have a regular plan will work harder to fit into that routine, and this creates a habit for students to study well.
  Some argue that students can study a topic for a long time by taking one long vacation. They say that when students study one topic all the time, they need time to focus on long studies. However, even if students study one long topic, it is more effective to take several short vacations. When students study, it is just as important to spend time learning content on their own, just as it is to take time for someone to teach them through a class; moreover, if students don't have this time, they often forget what they've learned before. For this reason, taking short vacations for students is also beneficial for lessons that take long-term.
  To sum up, giving students several short vacations is better for academics because it gives an opportunity for students to regain concentration and allows them to plan both short-term and long-term. Moreover, it is an opportunity for students to find and study on their own when they study a topic in depth. Schools should always strive to create a great educational environment for their students. Allowing students to take several short breaks rather than one long break is the best way to make a better educational environment."	4	4.5	4.5	13

    Education has the vital role for growing students, and a college or university education is the most crucial education for their future. Some might argue that higher education should be available only to good students. In my opinion, a college or university education should be available to all students, and here are several reasons.
    First of all, education should be free to all students who want to take that. If there are restrictions that prevent students from learning, that should not be called as an education. Also, good students could be good since they are well educated; therefore, providing education only to good students cannot make other good students. In respect to the purpose of education, this is very absurd. Education should not be limited.
    In addition, the education itself will be more developed if many students are allowed to take it. Even if some students are not good in score and have lower grades, that does not necessarily imply that those students are not creative. They can make tons of foolish questions, but those questions could give insights to good students and clues for better education to lecturers. By allowing them to take advanced education, they might be able to give a clue for developing the education.
    Some might argue that allowing a college or university education to all students makes good students hard to study because there will be students who do not concentrate on the education. However, that is a minor issue and rather good students can teach such not-interested students and both of them could be better together. Having the experience of teaching friends, good students might be able to achieve more successful education. Also, the other students might be able to have interests in what they have learned.
    To sum up, a college or university education should be available to all students for above two reasons; the education should be free to all and the education itself will be more developed if many students are allowed to take it. Therefore, our universities and colleges should give education for all students who want it. By doing so, many students could be better off, attaining the purpose of education. "	4	3.5	3.5	11

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I think students must attend there classes. The reason is simple and obvious. The purpose of the taking lecture is to learn what student's don't know. Moreover the problem is students don't know exactly what they don't know. Of course trying to understand the lecture with their own is impoertant but they may miss really important points. In addition, sometimes they focus on less important parts and waste time. To prevent this problem, they need the professor's instruction.
The second reason is sometimes students can't understand lectures without any instruction. Some paper use indivisual words which made by the writer. In this case, students can't understand that word and concept mean. Usually it is explained by that paper but that is still hard to understand. During my indivisual researching project, I always face with new words and concepts when I read a new paper. Sometimes I could understand it exactly but sometimes couldn't. The professor said when a new concept is made, that's name is made without strict rules. In addition if student misunderstood basic concepts, they'll get many problems to understand other concepts. Therefore professors must explain basic concepts to prevent this problem so students must take classes and learn basic things.
To learn many things, students must study with their will. However they don't know what they exactly learn about. Therefore at least they need guidelines which made by professors. To follow these guidelines, students must take classes ."	3	3	3	9

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I think university students should attend their classes. First, in class, we can learn many things. It is difficult to understand something only by books. If we listen to the professor's explanation in class, we can understand more when we just read books. When trying to understand the same thing, it is easier to understand by listening to explanations in words than by reading them in writing. Second, we can ask questions in class when we have something we don't know. As we learn new content, we have something we don't know. In class, we can immediately ask the professor what we don't know. However, it will not be easy to know what we don't know unless we attend class. Finally, I think it is rude to the professor not to participate in class. Professors give lectures to teach us something. The professor will also take the time to prepare various things to give lectures. I think not attending class ignores this professor's efforts. For these three reasons, I think university students must attend classes."	2.5	2.5	3.5	8.5
870	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" Education is provided in various ways at universities. Especially two ways: classical face-to-face classes and non-face-to-face online classes based on edu4.0 are representing them. Of course, there will be a point of debate, but I agree that face-to-face classes give students and professors a little more advantage. 
 First, many preparations are needed for online classes to proceed systematically. The Internet connection must be good, the voice must be heard well, and even if all of these are well prepared, communication between professors and students cannot be achieved well if students do not listen well or mute prof's voice. However, face-to-face classes can be seen as having greater communication expected effects because it satisfies physical contact between them, which is the minimum factor for communication between professors and students. 
 In addition, non-face-to-face classes have high concerns about cheating. It is very important to prevent cheating for a fair and smooth test, but due to the nature of online, it is difficult to completely prevent cheating. For this reason, face-to-face classes also show better effects in terms of fairness in grades. 
 Despite these advantages, there is a limitation in that face-to-face classes are difficult to proceed if physical contact between people is restricted as in the current pandemic situation. However, in terms of communication quality and fairness of grades, the benefits of face-to-face classes are significant compared to non-face-to-face online classes. I hope that the situation will stabilize and face-to-face classes can be conducted like just before. "	3.5	3.5	4	11

"The most surprising thing about coming to college in high school was that there were classes without attendance scores and that there were many students running away right after checking attendance. And when I talked to my friends, there were cases said, ‘I didn't know why the university forced me to attend.’ At first, I didn't understand well because I just got out of high school, but as time passed, I gradually agreed.
A university is a higher education institution that students applies by choice unlike other compulsory education. Even if you don't want to receive compulsory education, you have to do it, but I think you can also choose attendance because college classes are taken at your own choice. We came to college because we wanted to learn more on our own, and we paid for it. It is also one's choice to fail to keep up with the progress of not taking classes or to get good grades due to it, and I think that freedom should be guaranteed. All choices come with responsibility. The evidence that attendance is not required is that it carries both disadvantages in the learning process and disadvantages in grades caused by not attending. As long as a student takes this much responsibility, I think attendance can be done autonomous."	2	2.5	2.5	7

But some people believe that going to classes should be optional for students. It means that they are so lazzy. I have some reasons that we should be required to attend classes.
 First, the goal of university is very various. However, the most important goal is education. It means that very various goal such as ,friend, opportunity, etc is also important but university is organization for education. So, we need to attend classes. Some people can think that we can learn the knowledge without class. But, if you have the experience that you don't attend class, we can know that it is wrong . University is the organization for education. So people should be required to attend classes.
 Second, most of people can tend to be lazzy if they don't have classes. Most of people should be lazzy without regular schedule. So they may only play game, sleep, drinking if classes should be optional. So I think that regular schedule is very important to make people diligent. In my case,  i work and study very diligently during the semester. But i am very lazzy during vacation. So we should be required to attend classes.
 Third, we can make friend in class. When we make friend, meeting regularly is very important. Class can make meeting regularly. then we can make friend easily. If we have many friends to have common interest, it can also help our dream. So class is required and we should attend the class.
 To sum up, we have three reason to be required to attend class. First, the goal of university is education. Second, class can make people diligently. Third, class can help people make friend. So, I think attending class should be not optional. "	2.5	2.5	3	8

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I strongly believe that university students should be required to attend classes in time. It would be the most effective method to prevent various side-effects. What would be the side-effects of being absent during the classes?
  First, It would trigger increase of private education. Some people might argue that the university students don't have to attend class if they already know the content of class. However, that is definitely wrong argument. Let's think of the goal of listening to class for many students. They exactly listen to classes in order to get a good grade(GPA). So, if participation score is not counted for a grade, they have actually no reason to attend classes. Therefore many students would not attend classes regardless of knowledge about the content of the class. And in the case of the students who don't know exactly about the content of the class, they would fall into private education in order to get a good grade. Then the market of private education about university classes would be larger and larger, which would decrease the importance of university lecture by professor.
  Second, It would get rid of the opportunities to keep relationship between professor and students. The goal of lecture by professor is not only to convey useful information about the subject, but also to keep in touch with students. Professors would introduce their research field related to the lecture during class, and some students, who had interest with the research field, would contact the professor. And it provides an opportunity for them to grow up while they communicate with professor more deeply than in the class.
  In conclusion, I strongly think that the university students should attend classes in order to prevent private classes and keep opportunity to make relationship between professor and students. Let's say you're a professor. You would have lots of knowledge about the lecture and want to share the experience to your students. Then I guess you might be very happy if all students participate your class and focus on that as they ask questions about your research. Let's go to Advanced Writing class now!"	3	3	3.5	9.5

It is true that it's hard to attend classes because of tiredness and laziness. However, I think university students should have its own duty to attend the classes.

  First reason of duty on attending classes for university students is reasons of attending university. When we think of the reasons why we enter the university, we can derive many reasons for that. Even if we have lots of reasons for entering university, I think most of us came here to study or to specialize what we want to do in our future. So, classes provides you about those information which you need for future. Which mean, when you do not attend classes, you do not have a future plan.
  Second reason of attending in classes is about your promises. When you choose the classes to attend that semester, you may not know but it is kind of promises that you'll attend classes and listen carefully to get what you want in this classes. To think that it is optional to attend classes is same with making your promises optional. You know that you can't change promises because of your change of mind. Attending classes is to keep your promises with professors.
  Third reason is regarded with money. You may not know about the value of classes because most of KAIST's students does not pay for it, and even if you pay for it, it's cheap. However, when you get some information about the classes's value for other university, you may surprised by its cost. What I think is when you pay for your classes, you have to attend the classes  to get that value meaningful for your life. You should use your money for you not for other.

This is all my opinion about why we have to attend the classes in the university. We does not live forever and our time is finite. Spend your capital for you and live where you want to live by attending classes."	4	3.5	3.5	11

There are several reasons why I prefer attending class than going to classes optionally.
First, attending classes can prevent other behaviors like watching Youtube or facebook. Since there are professors and many students, it is hard to do other behaviors. If so, they can more concentrate their study. On the other hands, taking the class via online program like zoom or KLMS, students can take a class in the room where no ones in. It is very hard to concentrate the class only with mind-control. So, attending classes make students easy to study with strong concentration.
Second, attending classes also can prevent laziness. If students taking a online class, they do not need to taking a shower, or wearing a clothes such as jumpers. This situation delay time to wake up and make students lazy. However, students who attend classes should be taking a showers, wearing a good jackets to show their beautiful outside. Furthermore, they spend time to move to classroom. So, students who attend classes wake early to prepare above things.
In conclusion, going to classes optionally can make students not only lazy but also reducing concentration. So, I prefer attending class since there are many bad points about going to classes optionally."	3	3	3	9

In the Korean society, many people enter a college because getting a job without a college diploma is difficult. However, forcing students go to a college is wrong education. Only students who want to study should go to a college . There are several reasons why college education should be available to students who they want.
First of all, college education should be specific and professional. During the teenage period, school education's main purpose is teaching various knowledge as a basic level.  Therefore college should teach professional knowledge for their major and job. In addition, some jobs do not require expertise and college diploma. It means that college education is meaningful only some students.
Moreover, college expenses are too expensive to students who just become adults. People who just graduate high school should earn for their daily life. However, college expenses are expensive to them; so, they should get a scholarship or loan. They should pay many things such as money and time; but, college education could be useless to some of them.
Some argue that students must go to a college to be socialized as an adult. However, socializing is one of the important role of high school education. One of high school's purpose is making students from teenagers to adults. Therefore socializing is already done at a high school; so socializing at a college is not necessary.
To sum up, only students who want learn academic knowledge should enter a college because it is only useful in their major and it require high expenses. As the society require meaningless college diploma, many students cannot do what they really should do. To solve this problem, the awareness of this society should be changed.

     After graduating from high school, many students enter universities. They can take a high level of lectures at university. Some people believe that university education should be availabe to all students. However, high level university education should be available only to good students.
     First of all, not all students can understand the university education. Universities usually select students with excellent high school grades. They give students very high level lectures than high schools. Therefore, students who fall behind in high school will find the university education difficult. It can be a waste of time for them to enter university and take classes.
     In addition, it is difficult to accommodate a very large amount of students in universities. If university education becomes a duty to all students, every student enters universities. Thus, more students will enter universities than before. Professors at universities should teach a larger number of students than before. This is a very difficult task for professors and TAs.
     Some argues that all students should take a high level education. However, some students want to get a job after graduating from high school. They want to go out to society early and earn money. Because they think it is better to learn skills early than to study more. These students do not need to take a high level of university education.
    To sum up, not all students need to take the university education. Higher university education should be available only to the students who recived high grade in high schools. That is because many professors and TA's efforts are involved in teaching high level classes."	4	4	3.5	11.5

 Education plays a very important role in achieving students' personal growth. In particular, as people's education level increases in modern times, the importance of higher education is increasing. However, not everyone can receive higher education. Higher education is only worth receiving from excellent students who can absorb it well, and there are three reasons for this. 
 First of all, higher education must be focused on excellent children to maintain a certain quality of higher education. Most high schools and universities cannot be maintained without taxes from the people. Taxes are limited and should be used in the direction of maximizing the public interest. However, if higher education is conducted for all students, the quality of higher education will inevitably decrease because it must be tailored to all children with a wide level of knowledge. In other words, the level of education is maintained only when higher education is provided to intelligent children. 
 In addition, higher education for students who do not need it is a waste for them. If the government forcibly conducts higher education to students who do not need it, students must spend a lot of time there. Especially for students who need economic activities right now, such a waste of time can be a major obstacle to their lives. This choice is not for the public interest of all students. 
 Moreover, it is more beneficial for universities to conduct higher education to excellent students. Universities have three purposes: education, research, and service. Especially in the case of research, outstanding people tend to lead, and the cost of investing is high. However, if higher education should be conducted for everyone, the cost invested in research will be reduced, and there will be no one who can conduct the research. This can greatly interfere with the development and research of science.

Today, college or university education are available only to good students. Therefore, some people can not go to college because of their low score on the tests. Some people argue that it is right which means higher education should be available only to good students. However, my opinion is that higher education should be available to all people.
First of all, higher education could be a second chance to some people. Some people could get low score on high school tests because they have to earn money or take care of their family. Like them, many people have sad stories, so they could not get higher education. Society should give people with low grades because of inevitable situation a chance to make a comeback.
Next, not allowing to get higher education because of bad scores is ridiculous criterion. Grades are the result of the test, so test scores are influenced by luck. In Korea, most of the high school exams and national college entrance exam are multiple choice. Therefore, even if students study poorly, their grades can be good if they are lucky, and if they are unlucky, their grades can be bad. Therefore, grades never serve as a criterion for evaluating students.
Lastly, some people believe that higher education only for good students could be beneficial for whole society, but some people who attended college give negative impacts on society and some people who did not attend college give positive impacts on society. For example, many people who got higher education committed the crime with very sneaky way and some people who did not get higher education donate to poor people.
To conclude, as higher education could be a second chance to some people, not allowing to get higher education because of bad scores is ridiculous criterion, and some people who attend college give negative impacts on society and some people who did not attend college give positive impacts on society, college education must be available to all people."	4	3.5	3.5	11

      Generally, most high school students study hard to enter a college or a university. Because students can learn refined professional knowledges, students are trying to enroll. Some argue that all of the students available to higher education, not only good students. However, for several reasons, only some good student can take higher education.
      First of all, class which consist of good students increase quality of education. Because students in class have similar and high level of learning, professor of class not have to explain simple or basic principle, and can give more advanced knowledges. Also, since students have high level, questions that provided during the class is high level, too. Therefore, as students are good at study, quality of class increases and students can learn more professional things.
      Additionally,  In terms of university management, it is reasonable for only good students to enter. Of course, the probability that graduated students become famous and succeeded in the future is higher for good student than others.

     Most students in Korea learn the college or university education. In Korea, entering the college is available to all students; however, the university is different by their grades in the high school . Furthermore, the support is different by their college. someone thinks that it is unfair to the students who get a bad grade. However, it have various advantages. University or college education should be available to the students who have a good grade due to motivations, economic problem, and students' dream.
     First of all, high education should be available to good students because of motivations. If they need good grades for entering the colleges, it is a huge motivations to high school students. This motivation makes the students active and passionate about study. If they have a certain goal or motivation, their efficiency of study is higher than the past. Then, the education level of students is higher, and teachers can train a lot of talented person.
     In addition to motivations, it can save a lot of money about higher education. The higher education needs big supports; that is, the government spend a lot of money for the college or university. However, limiting higher education is the best way for decrease of cost. Some students only go to the university, and they do not learn the lecture well. That is, a lot of money for education is wasted. The limiting education prevent the money, and the government can use a lot of money for other things. 
     Finally, someone argues that it is unfair to the students; however, it is not true. The government can arrange the limit grades enough low; so, the students who want to learn the higher education can get higher educations. In addition, most students who have bad grades do not want to enter the college; however, they go to the college by their parents. This limit can prevent this situation. The government can help them by using the money from decrease of educational cost. 
     To sum up, limiting the higher education have a lot of advantages. Now, some students in Korea go to the colleges although they do not want to go to the college. It is not efficient. The government can save a lot of money by this limiting, and they can use this money for increase of the education's quality or helping other students. The limiting higher education is efficient and give a good effect for everyone. The government should limit the higher education."	4	3.5	3.5	11

           Education is necessary for people to live wisely. If education is not given to all students, the society will get confused. Some people argue that it is not necessary for idiots. However, the opportunity of education should be provided equally. College education should be available to all students.
            First of all, it is fair to give all the students the opportunities to get a college education. There can be students who do not want to get a college education. Even if they want to work in factory earlier instead, the opportunity for education should be offered equally and the choice is up to their preferences. For example, a student was very poor in high school, so he could not study well and got poor score in high school. But he earns money and works hard in order to get a college education. The opportunity for education has to given to him.
             In addition to giving fair opportunities, college education should be given to all students since it makes the base of knowledge which is neccesary to live in real life. For example, stock training in college education is necessary for all students to live economically. Lectures about various cultures in college education is necessary to understand the manner in each country.
             Others argue that it is a waste in time and resources to give a education to students who are not good at study. However, it is too early to judge them by score in high school. There are so many students and their potentials are very various. Among them, there can be some students who did not find their gifts yet. If they get a professional college education, they will discover what they are good at, and they will contribute to society in their fields. It is not a waste for society; rather, it is benefitial for society.

  For students who are eager to study, the education of college or university is an incredibly cool and interesting process. They indulge and enjoy learning more difficult things out of the endless curiosity of what they have learned; therefore, some adults related to education believe that early education for these excellent students will be necessary. However, despite the ability of students, early education should not be executed.
  First of all, students can have a distorted perception of society by early education. The most important point of education is not only teaching the fundamental knowledge necessary for life, but also how to establish the right social relationship between students. When students are evaluated and sided for early education, students will take it for granted for class society. So, early education should not be implemented to cultivate the right perspective on real society.
  In addition to wrong perspective about society, early education can create students' wrong thinking processes. The reason why the stages and processes of education are divided is to develop the right thinking process for that age. For example, by having students memorize multiplication tables, they can calculate 3 times 3 very quickly and simply. However, education take more importance on knowing principles of multiplication than calculating, and early education will make the thinking process of students value results more than understanding principles.
  Some may repute that early education will make each student's future faster and more comfortable. However, it is more important for students who will lead the future to become future-changing person than to live their lives comfortably. In order to become a person who changes the future, they must have the right social perception and thinking processes. It is important to know that education is not just about changing the future of students, but about the future of all humanity.
  To sum up, early education can destroy student's social perspective and thinking process. For these reasons, early education must not be implemented for student's and humanity's future. Remember that education is the only innovation that changes our future."	2.5	3.5	4	10

    In general, students have winter or summer vacations for taking a break. In the vacation, students go to trip, learning swimming, or do something that they want. Some argues that they want only one long vacations to do more things. However, several short vacations are helpful for several reasons.
          First of all, several short vacations can be one of powers for studying. Almost people wish that weekends come faster; furthermore, there is word to greet weekends, TGIF: Thanks God Its Friday. Thus, holiday is one of the power for standing their work. Vacation also do this role for students. Therefore, several vacation means several powers for studying.
          In addition, several short vacations can reinforce defects. When students take the classes, there can be exist unknown things. Vacations are one of good times for reinforcing their defects in studying or other fields; for example, they can learn powerpoints skills if they want to improve presentations.
          Lastly, several short vacation can maintain study habits. Some argues that long vacation can do more and deeper activities. However, most important duty for students is studying. Long vacation can make students forgetting their studying habits since they are concentrate other things that they want. Therefore, several short vacation is helpful to study.
          To sum up, several short vacations are helpful because this can be a power for studying. Furthermore, several short vacation can not only  reinforce defects, but also maintain study habits.

Of course, someones who have extraordinary talents does not need to take classes, but most of students need to take classes to understand the contents of classes. Furthermore, attending classes is not just studying the materials of textbook. It is communication between professor and student. Professors  teach students not only materials in textbook, but also their personal experiences and their trick or outline to achieve student's accomplishment. Last, Attending class is a student's basic manner. Attendance is the most basic way to express respecting the professor, class, and the academy. Respect is very important to evaluate one man.

On-line classes based on Zoom meetings became very popular, while watering down the value of attending classes. Many would argue that we still need checking attendance in classes. But in my personal opinion, I think that attendance should be not considered as a requirement for university students.
  First, I think 'passed class' means the University's certification of attended student's knowledge or ability in that particular subject. It is true that students are taking courses in the university to learn something, but the university's job is to certify if the student is well skilled for the specified field. After the graduate, it is most important to make every single student is well treated based on their knowledge or skills. However, checking attendances and grades students with will confuse it, may deliver wrong values of each.
  Second reason is that checking attendances in every class may burden both professors and TAs a lot when it becomes a big class with more than hundreds attendees, especially for TA if there is not enough. I personally have many friends both undergraduates and post graduates, quite old enough to do TA and help freshman or sophomores. And I know that they are already busy enough taking their own courses and working hard for their degrees, have left limited ability for job of TA. Therefore, if too many work is assigned for them, it may decline efficiency of his or her own learnings and supporting classes.
  To summarize, I think that university students shouldn't be required to attend classes. Because, attendance is not the most important feature figuring out whether the students' are skilled enough in what class teaches, and it burdens both professors and TAs a lot, especially for TA who is also a student."	3.5	3	3	9.5

"Students have a lot of necessaries to study at university; attendance, term exams, and several quizzes. Some people thinks that university students should have to attend classes, while others do not. I totally believe that university students should be required to attend classes. There are several reasons as follows.

First of all, measuring attendance score will improve student's academic skills. Students who participate frequently in classes can easily understand the information the professor teach. These students are likely to receive a good grade in university. For example, In my case, I was not great students at first grade of KAIST. I always went to play soccer and not to classes because I did not understand what professor talked about. After getting extremely low score at mid-term exam, I decided to attend all classes even though I could not understand lectures. Gradually, I can conceive the lecture because they provide me a number of demonstrations and illustrations. Therefore I took better scores at final exam. I realized that if I did not join in classes, I would fallen behind.

Second, Students can broaden their networks by attending classes. If students attend classes, they could easily share their ideas about lectures. This opportunities tends to create new network they interested in. For instance, Sangwoo, my classmate, was introvert student who feel difficult to mingle with others. He has a few friends to get along with. However, He got a lot of new friends after joined the physics seminar class. I asked him how did he make friends and I got an answer like this, ""There are a lot of people like me. They have many common things."" He usually play computer game and study with that friends. If he did not join the seminar, he would felt lonely.

To sum up, I strongly believe that students in university have to attend classes.  "	3	3	3	9

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Student is the person who is learning. To learn thoroughly, I assert that attending is required for following two reasons.
     To begin with, in the class, student can learn more things that also cover not in the book. There are such activities which are not easy to get in the books or Internet like experiments, demo, and etc. Experiments and demo can show that textual things can be true in live, those realistic experiences may spurt interest or curiosity of students. In my personal experience, I did not have much interest in science in elementary school, but after I saw lots of experiments, I got curious how they come and now I am in KAIST.
     Moreover, students can question directly what they do not understand. Most of the lecture has correlative relations with notions which explained before. If students feel difficulty about previous things, they might be unable to catch not only the meaning  but also flow of the entire lecture. In my case, I was hesitate to question before therefore if I have something that I do not know, I could not understand what the professors said all the time in that lecture. However, after questioning what I do not know, I started to get the meaning of that lecture small by small. 
     From these two reason, I strongly agree with the statement that university students should be required to attend classes."	2.5	3	3	8.5

"Due to COVID-19, online class using Internet become a new trend of learning and teaching method in university. Some people believe that it is more comfortable and efficient than offline real time lecture since it only requires the computer and mobile devices to attend the class. But for me, who have experienced both offline and online lecture, I think offline lecture has much more benefits than offline lecture.
First, university is not a place that only for learning some academic knowledge,  but also for communicate with other students and professors so that one can learn and experience much more things such as communication techniques, co-working experience. But in offline lecture, it is not easy to communicate each other and so, in many cases, lecture changes its original format to fit in offline lecture, so that it contains more individual work rather than co-working projects. It's definitely not desirable  for many lectures, including language classes, which requires to communicate each other to improve one's language skills.
Second, there are many issues about cheating in offline lectures, since it's hard to check individually only through camera and audio. Due to limitation of camera angle and materials(apps), it's not hard to pretend as an 'innocent student' while cheating, even TAs and professors try to check whether he or she is really an innocent student. It's not only a big problem for exam or quiz, but also for attendance and participation.  This can hinder fair competition among students and reduce academic achievement."	2.5	3	3	8.5

In my experience, 'Data Structure' class in Computer Science department, it is almost free attendance class. Students just get the lecture if they need, and professor makes tests ; some co-work activity, individual homework, and quizes ; to know that how much students get the topic of lecture. This class makes students study more comfortable ; they can study when they could focus well ; and almost of students got high score in quiz. From this case, I want to explain why I suggest free attendance.
First, students have freedom to choose that they study. It means students can judge that  lecture is necessary for them. It does not means that students will be lazy and don't study hard. If students know about the lecture, they should not to get lecture. Some class give review of pre-attended class for first, students who got good grade at that class should skip the lecture.  In that time, they can study for other lecture or just sleep more. Also, if lecture is too loose, students study alone and study faster. They, students who can study faster than lecture, always study alone even if they attend to lecture. They just sit down for attendance points.
Second, optional attendance makes lecturer work harder. From first opinion, students should take the lecture that they need. Professor should make attractive lecture to get more students attendance. And they should communicate with students to know what they think for lecture. Also they should test students more harder to check student's work. Some class only have final report to test students. But it makes students just make short time study called thunderstorm. To make student study, they should make more activities and quiz.
At all, freedom of attendance will make both students and professor work harder. Students can focus the important issues, and professor can make students study efficiently. Self-study is important part for university students, and optional attendance policy will help to practice it. "	3	3	3	9

There are students who learn about majors that they really want to know about, but others are not, just keeping their states that attending to universities. Some people say that university students should be required to attend classes. However, I believe that students should choose in their own whether go to classes or not. There are few reasons that why I think this way. 
 First of all, I think students should choose whether they go to classes or not because it will be more helpful to them. For example, I want to participate in the research about batteries and to apply graduate school about the research. But if I required to attend every classes that do not related with the topic, it will be waste of time for me, and every other students will feel same thing. University students are adult and they are mature enough to consider what classes they need. So classes should be optional for students so that they can select classes that will be useful to them and their interests. Spending time to classes that are not related to their interests and even not helpful, may be meaningless to students. 
 Secondly, I think students should choose whether they go to classes or not because it will be beneficial to social society, not only to students themselves. For instance, one of my acquintances had lots of knack in teaching students, but did many other things before making decision to teach. Like this, all people have to learn and develop their own faculties in their lives because society can be more abundant through people's faculties. If they do other things that they do not have any interest and talents, it will be waste of their precious time and loss to human society. For these reasons, I think going to classes should be optional to students."	3	3	3	9

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"In Korea, the importance of class attendance is emphasized from the compulsory education curriculum, which continues to universities. It forces moral problems through attendance and infringes on student freedom of students. I prefer class to be optional for the following reasons.
First, the presence or absence of class attendance violates the freedom of students. Attendance in class should be entirely available to students. As the importance of each individual in the 21st century increases, each has a variety of situations. Since professors can not systematically handle individual situations in consideration of all, administrative processing that varies from person to person makes someone feel inequality. In particular, the way students communicate their situation to the professors and resolve attendance can feel the stress of informing the professors of their privacy. Attendance should be not an obligation, and students can take responsibility so that students can flexibly design their life according to own individual schedule and situation.
Second, the current attendance system has lost its purpose. The meaning of the attendance system is to confirm attitudes and improve the quality of classes through attendance management of students. On the contrary, in reality, even if attendance is checked, students who are not interested in the class do not focus on the class, but voluntarily focus on the class if they are interested. In addition, as the number of acts such as proxy attendance is increasing for loopholes in the attendance management system, the effectiveness is low and only the number of unfortunate victims is increased. Attendance should not only be focused on rules, but should also be left to autonomy to realize the purpose of the system.
While saying that Korean universities should grow to stand with prestigious universities around the world, they still maintain an outdated position on university policy. Students should be able to actively participate in classes through freedom rather than duty."	4	4	4	12

Due to COVID 19, KAIST students are forced to participate class through zoom(or youtube, with recorded lecture) in 2 years. I have experienced both type of classes, and my opinion is that attending class is not mandatory.
First, forcing students to participate class in specific time can make negative effects for some students. For example, assume that some class starts at 9 a.m. Most of people would agree that it is really hard to concentrate on those classes, even for KAIST students who live in dormitory. For students who live far from university, it would be harder to concentrate on lectures. They will use their energy while they run into classroom. If going to class is not mandatory, I think this kind of problem will be solved.
Secondly, some classes are more efficient to study through online. In my case, lectures are not very helpful for some courses with extremely massive assignments. Just studying through Google and asking to my project mate were much more helpful than professor's lecture. If this kind of lecture forces students to participate class all the time, I think it is not good for most of students including me.
Finally, there exists acceptable alternating solutions. We can make some chance to save our scores for attendance, like students can absent for 1-2 times with no penalty. Some strict policies for attendance make students stressful, and I think it is not good for understanding course materials. 
Since I hadn't experienced offline class for past 4 years(due to COVID 19 and duty for army), I hope to meet friends and want to participate offline classes. However, I still think going to class is not mandatory for all classes. "	3.5	4	4	11.5

 First, students can understand the contents of the class better than studying themselves. Actually, contents of most classes in university are often hard for students to understand perfectly. In that case, they can ask questions to professor directly, so their learning performance would be better.
 Also, missing the class is waste of money. Attending the class and listening to the class is included to the college tuition. If students do not attend the class, then the meaning of paying it disappears.

 People has their own way of studying. Someone wants to listen to the professor, but someone wants to study alone. The efficient study methods vary from person to person. I think student be able to choose whether to attend or not. The criterion of choice will be their tendency.
 Someone can say not attending classes may effect on consistency badly. But I think that is up to each individual choice and we have responsibility for our choices .Students take a lot of time and effort to study. They like taking a rest or playing games than studying.  But they endure to make their dream come true. If a student choice sleeping instead of attending class, he may feel uncomfortable at first. But if it repeats, he will be used to doing like that. Finally, sleeping instead of attending class become a habit. This effect his score very badly. But It is the result of his choice. We are adult, not kid.

Moreover, it is good for professors too, since lecture videos and materials can be reused and professors can save their time. Some might argue that it can prompt students to postpone taking lectures and reduce students' academic abilities. However, that problem can be handled by asserting appropriate restrictions to taking lectures, such as limiting time period that students are allowed to access lecture materials. For these reasons, I support that university students should be able to take class at anytime and anywhere they want."	2.5	2.5	3	8
899	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I think going to classes should be optional for university students, because of three reasons: university students are adult who have to take responsibility of their choice, students who doesn't have interest will make the class mood bad, additional resources are used to check attendance. 
First of all, unlike high school students, university students all adult. They should take responsibility of their choice. They learned on high school or middle school that not taking class may harm their understanding, which are leading to bad grade and misunderstanding. If they don't take the class even though they know it will bad for themselves, then that's the responsibility of them. 
Second, students who are not interested in the class may harm the class mood. It's quite easy to see students in big class who are sleeping or doing game with their laptop, even if the class was held in offline not online. Think about the other students and professor who see those students. It will be really depressing.
Third, additional resources are needed to check attendance of students. For example, some class take picture at the start of the class and end of the class, to make the evidence of attendance. After the class, the professor or the helper of professor should check the picture and check the students one by one whether they attend or not. This will require them additional work which can be used to improve the lecture. 
I agree that requiring students to attend class will make the average achievement of the students higher. Maybe some students will listen to the lecture if they attend the class. But, at the same time, it will harm the performance of the student who are highly-interested and willing to study. I think university should more focus on the interested student whether than take care of all students. University is not high school. "	3	2.5	3	8.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"     I think going to classes should be optional for university students. Because being optional to go to classes for students is better than compelling them to attend classes for 3 reasons. 

  Firstly, any students have their own life style, compelling them to attend the class room will limit their activities. University students need various experiences like travelling, volunteer, participating internships of some companies, and so on. But if students should attend the classes, then they will be at the class during the given lecture time, which makes their outdoor activities more difficult. So, if there is a duty to attend class every time for students, students can't experience various experiences and their sight will become narrower. 


  Secondly, there are still many ways to test students who hasn't attended the classes. The professors can require to do the homework or solve a quiz  periodically. And students can send an email to the lecturers for understanding the class better. And actually, this type of asking is often better than real-time question. Because the students have enough time to write what they are curious about and can search various resources such as Internet and textbooks, which makes the content of the email more precise and readable. So, not requiring to attend class for students doesn't make checking students' understanding and communication worse than letting students attend classes.

  Finally, there can be some lectures that deals with the contents students already knows well. Some competent students often study their own textbooks by themselves. And if they studied specific chapters of the textbooks very well, attending the classes where teaching the chapter the students already understood well is wasting time for them. For such students, just let them study the textbook as they want is better. If the students think they don't understand some topics of the classes, then they will attend the classes. So, studying will be more flexible and efficient for students. 


  As 3 reasons above, I claim that students should have a right to decide whether they will attend the classes or not freely. It makes students be able to experience more things. Also, it doesn't make testing students more difficult at all. And more flexible studying will be possible by that.  So, it is better not to let students attend classes."	3.5	3.5	3	10

          Today, many universities in Korea make students to select their majors when they enter the university. However, this is not a good idea for students.  Students need the grace period to think about their majors. And during that period, students can take classes that they want. There are several reasons why students need rights to have the grace period to choose their majors.
          Firstly, most students are pressured from the burden of the university entrance exams throughout high school era in Korea. Therefore, they do not know well what they want to study in general. In this situation, choosing the majors early and specializing on that major can lead students to the wrong choice. It would be a great loss for both university and students.
          Secondly, even though students select there majors in their own hands, they would find that the majors could not suit them. In this case, students just should take the class that they are not interested in, and it is very harmful for students' future. If students can take many kinds of classes for various majors, universities can prevent these things from happening.;for example, in KAIST, freshmen can take any classes, and they can choose their majors after a year. They can find majors that suit their aptitude for a year. And after choosing that, if the majors do not suit, they can change freely.
          However, Some people would say that all the choices that students make are their responsibility. That is true. However, university not just academic institutions in today. It is for a better future for students. In this regard, university should ensure that students have wider options for their futures.
          In Conclusion, the university requires students to take a variety of majors. Even though some people would say that that is the choice for students, the experiences of taking many types of major classes would help many students. Furthermore, it will help inform the students a wide range of knowledge that would helpful to their futures."	4	4	3.5	11.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Normally, students choose a single major when they enter the university. However, some university require students to take classes in many subjects. It is normally called ""fusion education"". In the student's point of view, it can be annoying because they are busy enough to learn their major. However, there are also several benefits at learning other subjects. 

  First, studying other subject make student can think in various point of view. People in each department see the world from a different perspective. Even if the student does not study deep knowledge of other subjects, it is enough to experience what people from other disciplines think about the same problem. In university, there are hundreds of other subject classes like humanity, nature science, engineering, art and design. It is such a great opportunity to experience other subject classes. Moreover, such opportunities will become more difficult to find after graduation. Therefore, it is a waste not to take classes in other departments at the university.


  Second, Knowledge about other subject will help student communicate with different people when they get a job after graduation. In the work field, to solve a single problem, experts from many different subjects gather together, and share their opinion. For example, the student who learned industrial design will collaborate with experts in computer science, marketing, engineering, etc. If the student have never took the other subject class, it should be hard to communicate with them.


  Other says students should be specialized in one subject so that student should not waste time to learn other subject class. This argument, however, it can make student's life more convenient. Otherwise, after they get job,

  In conclusion, requiring students to attend other subject class will help student to get wide view on scholarship, and to collaborate with other subject people. "	4	3.5	4	11.5

  Some may argue that universities require students to take classes in many subjects. However, in my opinion, universities must require students to specialize in one subject.
  Firstly, having a specialized knowledge in one subject becomes an advantage when getting a job. Companies want their employees to be experts on their major, not a multi-talented. This is also a case for graduate schools, they need a researcher who can write a paper, not a gray zoned student with a high grade. Since time is limited, focusing on a single major seems reasonable for students.
  Secondly, learning more than a single subject burdens students too much. 
  Some argue that students should take classes in many subjects to be long on common sense. However, every students already took their 12 years of integrated education, and does not seem to need more.
  In conclusion, university must require students to be specialized in one subject. It eventually would give students an advantage for both who get a job or who go to a graduate school. Moreover, trying to learn more than a single subject gives too much burden to students. Some may argue that students should be long on common sense, truth is that every students already learned enough through their 12 years of compulsory education.

Choosing major subject is the most important event in students' lives because it can influence their jobs and values. Some says that students should specialized in one subject. However, in my opinion, university students should take classes in many subjects. 
 First of all, university students can think more widely. They can study various subject which seem to have no relation between each subjects. If they find the intersection of different subjects, they can combine knowledges which they learned in classes. Students will not only become creative but also give a more attention in each subjects; therefore, they have a wide view of each subjects. 
 In addition to thinking widely, students who take many courses can get a job easily. For getting a job, a company require applicants to show many abilities. For example, they need great English skills, common senses, and presentation. If someone already know a lot of information about different subjects, they are likely to be considered as proper applicants. 
  Although many say that student have no specialized major as they take many classes. It is partial ture but not all. In field which need advanced technology and great hand skills, the specialized major is necessary for getting a job. On the other hand, in many other field, specific major does not required. 
  In conclusion, students should take many classes in different subjects as possible for thinking widely and getting a job. Students can learn more and have a huge horizon to see their knowledgments.

     Unlike high school, college students choose their major and choose a subject that suits their major. Their choice of subject is based on the requirements of each college. Some colleges require taking multiple subjects on a variety of topics; on the other hand, some colleges require learning professional knowledge on a single subject. Controversy continues over which of the two is desirable, and in my opinion, it is better to learn a specific subject professionally. It is based on two reasons; high academic efficiency and can be an expert on the subject.
     First of all, learning a subject professionally can increase academic achievement and efficiency. If college students continue to study a specific subject consistently, they can understand the overall flow through the subject, thereby enhancing their understanding of the subject. Consistent learning that does not look away can naturally improve academic achievement. In addition, interest and efficiency increase as they study their favorite subjects; therefore, students' satisfaction with their studies increases.
     Secondly, college students can become experts on the subject. The reason why students go to college is to become experts in a specific field and get a job in that field; therefore, colleges need to organize curricula so that students can become experts on a specific subject. If students learn a subject deeply, that is, become experts, they can perform better than others by utilizing what they have learned in college even after they have a job in the future. It can improve students' future lives as well as their present lives. 
     Some people say that learning a wide field in college can increase the vocational diversity that college students can choose in the future. However, when students learn various fields, their depth is naturally licked; therefore, they graduate from college without actually learning important things and learning only basic contents. Far from increasing occupational diversity, it can lead to a lack of ability to find a job.
     In conclusion, colleges should require students to learn specific subjects professionally. That way, not only can students' academic achievement and efficiency be improved, but they can also become experts in the field. If students learn a specific subject professionally, they will be able to get the job they want more easily and the happiness of their future lives will increase."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"In general, universities require to choose major for students. For graduation, students should take a lot of classes and research in their major. Some university require students to take many subjects, but other require students to study specialized subject. With the progress of the knowledge, students need to take classes in many subjects for several reasons.
     First of all, society requires generality for students. Nowadays, one specialists can not make a big find. The generalist, called pi-gifted, are better than specialists for the century of 4th Industry. In the 4th industry, people can not work and research alone. Furthermore, people need to co-work for every sections. The experience to learn about many subjects will help them co-work with various majors. 
     Next, universities are not only the end of studying, but also the middle station of studying. There are graduated schools after the university graduation, and students who want to go graduated schools should search the major more. While study for many subjects related for their major, some students find new roads. With this new way for research, they go to graduated schools and become the innovative researchers. With the experience for studying several subjects, the diversity of studying will improved.
     Some argues that university should specialize students and make them memorize more knowledges. In fact, students do not have to memorize the knowledges with Google. In contrast, they need to connect the knowledges. There are so many books, articles, and researches; in this situation, even professor can not memorize that all knowledges. Human knowledge will progress rapidly, so students just need connect them and find new knowledge. 
     To sum up, university should make students to study many subjects for students future. By learning for several classes, students can be better co-worker with generality, and they have opportunities to search the new road for graduated schools. Also, they should learn how to connect different majors for new find. With study for many subjects, students can be the better workers and researchers.  "	4	3.5	3.5	11

Generally, students take lectures about various subjects, including English classes, physical activities and leadership classes. Some students claim that those classes are unnecessary for diverse reasons. However, in my opinion, students should take classes in various areas for several reasons.
     First of all, taking various areas' classes is necessary because it will be helpful when students are seeking their career path. Students should experience various fields because they do not know what they like to do most and are good at. Most students are young yet, so they should not decide their career path impatiently; instead, they have to think what they want to do carefully by taking many classes. If they are uninterested in themselves and just take classes about one subject, they will regret their behaviors in the future.
     In addition, universities have to require students to take lectures in many subjects because it can help them think more creatively. In modern society, various fields and technology are linked and create more creative products; for example, researchers need to understand both IT technology and electrochemistry when they want to manufacture electric cars. Like this, when students only know about one specialized subject, their knowledge may be useless. Also learning how to write and speak well is important because students need to express themselves.
     Some students argue that they have no much time to take various classes because they have to graduate quickly, and there are not enough time. However, actually they do not need to hurry too much, and drawing big pictures in their lives will be more helpful. Life is not too short and it is not waste of time, and many successful people say that people who run longer time will go the longest distance.
     To sum up, universities have to require students to experience various fields. It would be helpful to students for seeking their career path.

     World-leading celebrities do not stay in just one field. In addition to one's main major, a wide range of knowledge in various fields is needed. In order to grow into a successful talent, various educational curricula are emerging, but universities still remain in the past even though they are the last gateway just before talent heads to society. Now that complex developments in various fields take place, it is necessary to keep up with the trend of the times. In order for students to experience various career-related fields from college, universities should encourage students to take various courses for the following reasons.
     First, each student should be given the right choice for design. Reviews of subjects other than major requirements vary widely because each student has a different depth in dealing with major. For example, even with the same major, majors that are not related to their careers may feel unnecessary depending on the student. Rather, some majors can be efficiently approached in other subjects. It is necessary to lift restrictions on majors that allow them to make various choices depending on their circumstances.
     Next, it helps students get a job. Since various companies gradually prefer convergence talent, it is advantageous to get a job to show excellence in various subjects. In addition, since one's career path is constantly changing in life, increasing interest in various fields will help one develop one's career path. Universities also have different reputations depending on the employment rate of students. This will soon affect the quality of the class, so it will be able to start advantageously.
     Some argue that taking other subjects can lead to a decline in students' expertise. In fact, taking other related courses will be of greater help to your career than taking major courses for credit restrictions. Most subjects require knowledge in various fields as well as majors. In order to use this efficiently, experience in the subject is essential. In an era where various complex fields are in the spotlight, experience in various fields becomes a great competitive edge.
     In conclusion, universities should build efficiently so that students can take classes in various subjects. Unnecessary restrictions on required credits for majors should be lowered, and classes that can be linked to other subjects should be increased.
Through this, students will be able to follow the right curriculum in relation to their own careers. The future society is increasingly looking for creative convergence talents. Talent is born by mixing various knowledge in free exploration and play."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

Many students suffer from various subjects. In KAIST, for example, students must take fundamental courses to graduate properly. They include calculus and biology, and these two courses are quite unrelated. Sometimes it is related to uninteresting topics, or sometimes it is because of its massive assignments. In my opinion, taking many classes are important, and there are three reasons for that.
First of all, some subjects are very useful in life. Many students suffer from mathematics, but it is really helpful for improving creativity. Thinking about hard mathematical problems can improve not only mathematical techniques but also intuition for some problems.  English courses, on the other hand, is very useful to prepare English presentations or to read English paper. Most mandatory subjects are helpful for future, and that is one of the reasons for why they are mandatory. 
In addition, many subjects form a basis for advanced courses. Mathematics is one of the most famous examples about this, and it is widely used in many topics. Some special techniques for solving mathematical equations like differential equations are used for even in biology. Also, basic mathematics are important to study advanced mathematics. It is impossible to study topology without studying basic set theory and logic.
Some argue that studying various subjects can reduce efficiency for studying their own major. However, this is not true. The goal for major is shared by many people, and that is not related to other subjects. Furthermore, this problem can be solved through alternative solutions. Changing evaluation system like S/U grading or reducing assignments could be great solutions for this problem.
In conclusion, there are two important reasons why studying many subjects are important. First, some subjects are very useful in life. They can be applied into many real situations like calculating complex summations. Second, many subjects form a basis for advanced courses, and mathematics is famous example for that. Therefore, the government should consider that teaching various subjects are very important for their academic achievements when they decided to change curriculum for students."	4	4	4	12

     In university, students should take many classes. Some universities require them to take courses in many subjects, and other universities require them to specialize in only one subject. Some people may think that students should take classes in one subject. However, in my opinion, there are several benefits for students to take classes in many subjects.
     First of all, students can find what they are interested in. Most students may not know about what they prefer and what they want to do in the future. By taking courses in many subjects, they can identify the subject that they are interested in. It is helpful to university students who cannot decide their future career yet.

This broad range of knowledge may help students in their major subject; for example, in physics and chemistry, some concepts such as orbital are closely related, but the details are slightly different. Thus, they can better understand each subject.
     As mentioned, some people may feel that it is better for students to focus on one subject. They argue that concentrating on only one subject gives students deep knowledge; however, it narrows the perspective of students.

Taking multiple courses requires more time investment and effort. Nevertheless, there are several reasons to take multiple courses.
 Students can have a competitive edge when they want to employment or go to master's program after graduation. Taking a variety of subjects broadens the scope of knowledge and gives them a wide view of the world. Also, it can give other people the perception that they can do well not only in one field but also in various fields. These things create another distinction, not just grades, when they compete with others.
 Taking a variety of subjects helps students find their own career path. Students struggle to find their own career path, and a good solution is to study a variety of areas. If they specialize in one subject, it is difficult to determine whether it is their path or not, and even if they find out later, it is too late to go back. They can study several subjects during university and find the area that suits them.
 May think when students study multiple subjects, they cannot study deeply in their major. But in college life, there is something more important than studying your field deeply. They have to find their field of interest during their university life, and it is not too late to study in depth in their field in master's program.
 In conclusion, taking a variety of courses helps students choose a major they will not regret.

Although students look forward to the vacation, there are only two vacations in a year: summer and winter. In my opinion, students should have several short vacations throughout the year for several reasons.
First of all, students are less stressed while taking classes. Going through a lot of stuffs for months is not an easy thing to do. Even if they want to take a rest in the midst of the semester, they cannot easily abandon the time already spent for the semester Therefore, students end up getting too much stress. On the other hand, when the semesters are split, students can refresh themselves more often and get focused on studying more easily.
In addition to relieving stress, having shorter semesters and more vacations have advantage of class variety for students. When the semesters are shorter, they would try to apply classes with more various subjects; for example, they can apply interesting complex analysis or neuroscience classes. If students were to take those difficult subjects in a full semester, they would avoid to apply those classes. However, shorter semesters allow them to experiment with their performances in other fields.
Some say that several short vacations make students hard to do a long-term experiences such as traveling overseas. However, they can rest a short semester to create their own long vacation. In this way, semesters and vacations become more flexible for them.
To summarize, students need more vacations and shorter semesters in a year. They would be less stressed and try experimental and interesting subjects more often.

A university is the place that students learn about academic subjects deeply. University students usually focus on studying the specific subject that they choose as major; moreover, some universities encourage their students to only focus on their majors. However, in my opinion, universities should require students to take classes in many subjects for several reasons. 
First of all, learning various other subjects will help students to understand their majors deeply. Each subject is related to each other. For example, both physics and chemistry deal with Schredinger's equation. Students will understand the equation deeply if they can understand both physics' perspective and chemistry's perspective about that equation.
In addition, by learning various other subjects students can be creative. People can only develop their ideas from what they have learned. If students learn different contents compared to those who are majoring the same subject, they will be able to think up the great idea that the usual people can not think up.
Some people argue that universities should require students to specialize in one subject because companies usually prefer specialists rather than generalists. However, this is not true in these days. Because of the complication of the technology, it is important to cooperate each other in these days. Thus, companies now prefer ones with basic knowledge of other subjects which will make them easy to cooperate with ones with other majors. 
To sum up, universities should encourage students to take classes from various subjects.

             Recently many kinds of fields have appeared, and the relationship between the fields has become more complex. In order to understand a field seriously, he or she needs to know some concepts from other fields like mathematics or chemistry.  Nowadays, many students are wondering multiple disciplines are helpful or not. I believe that students have to take classes in many subjects for some reasons.
             Firstly, students can learn various ideas from many kinds of subjects. Each subject like mathematics or economics requires different kinds of ideas or abilities. For example, mathematics requires rigorous proofs; however, economics requires explanations based on real life. Each idea can be useful for each situation. Therefore, students who know various ideas from different kinds of subjects have the potential to deal with various situations.
             Secondly, students can meet many other students in various fields. Since working together is pretty frequent nowadays, building communication skills and the relationships between many other people in various fields is important. Attending many classes of various majors gives opportunities of communicating with other students from different majors to students. Consequently, students who take classes in many subjects will be able to work with other coworkers more smoothly.
             Although some argue that specializing in one subject is the best for researching subjects, learning many subjects is helpful for improving the level of research. Many difficult problems like human disease can be solved with help of several fields. Moreover, people who know well in several fields can know a wider range of problems in this world. That is the reason why professors with various bases can find the topics of research easily.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"It is debatable whether computers have made life more complex and stressful. This is intriguing question because the opinion concerning this issue can be different depending on people's perspectives. However, in my opinion, I strongly disagree with the statement. This is because computers supply more information and  do complex work process.
     First of all, we can get a lot of information by computers. What I mean is that, people cannot know all information such as how to make cake, how to solve math problem and so on. If we do not have computer, we find people who know information or books. Using computer, we find information very easily, just one click. For example, when I was in high school,  I lived in dorm. When I changed the dorm, new dorm's bath room is very dirty. I wanted to clean bathroom but it is very hard to remove all dirty thing. However, using computer, I could find information how to clean efficiently. Through this experience, I realized that computer makes life easier and more convenient. Hence,  this proves that  computers have made people life easier.
     Second, computer is the best machine to do complex work process because it can solve difficult problem during very short time. To be specific, excel solve difficult problems and show that, as a result, we can easily organize charts. People can save time to solve problems and do not have to consider how to solve it. For example, I did graduate project in last semester. There are a lot of data and equation. If I cannot use excel, I spent a lot of time to solve the equation and organized charts. However, using excel program, I can save a lot of time and one format can  apply all data. This is a good example to show that computer makes life better. Therefore, this shows that people life can be easier by using computers.
     In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers make people life better. All things considered, it is my belief that my argument regarding this topic has been effectively and precisely delivered with the reasons mentioned above."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"A large number of people might argue that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Contrary to popular belief, I think that the computer is quite helpful in our life for the following reasons: it allows us to widen our sight creating an intellectual enhancement and helps us get out of stress.
    First of all, a lot of information from the computer enables people to broaden their perspectives. This is mainly because people can be exposed to the different ideas and thoughts that they have never known before searching on the computer. Consequently, they can take a quantum leap in intellectual growth and accept diversity which is important in an era of globalization. For example, I enjoy watching 'Korean Englishman' on 'YouTube' sometimes. As a result, I understood and learned about a variety of cultural things such as British music, food, and clothing. This was because I saw videos that can hear viewpoints from native people.
    Secondly, playing computer games allow people to alleviate stress. This is mostly because that gaming can help them to relax and clear their mind. This brings a new solution to perplexing and stressful problems in daily life. Therefore, playing such games is one of the best and most effective ways to escape from harsh reality. For example, when I was in my last semester in university I was extremely exhausted and stressed due to excessive homework. Therefore, I played a computer multi-player game called 'Overcooked!' with my friends. While enjoying the game, I had a brief moment of relief from my stressful work. This was because we cooperated and cheered for one another to win, and ate some snacks together.
    In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers can give us lots of effective information and get away from stress for the reasons I have mentioned above. All in all, the importance of computers cannot be underestimated in order to improve the quality of life."	3	3.5	3	9.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"Although there are many side effects of computer, I think computer improved our life. computer has many abilities. such as communication, calculation, education, etc.
First, because of such abilities, we can easily be provided much information. in past times,  people had to buy newspaper, or listen rumors to gain information. So if they were in circumstance that isn't easy to get information, people were very hard to notice or be informed. even it was critical information such as war, disease. But, Nowadays, most of people even live in countryside has their cellphone, kind of computer. and Government can easily notice the critical issue such as COVID-19. 
 Second, Opportunity of education is provided equal to everyone. In past days, to get education of good quality, people had to enter good school. or move to city. because there was only face-to-face education. But nowadays, thanks to computer, if you have will to study, you can find education material easily. and they are cheap or even free. many students practice or study with internet lecture, and they can get feedback with their teacher in untact circumstance. if there were no computers in this COVID-19 situation, how school could provide education to there students?
At last, people who live in far distance can easily communicate each other. in past days, to meet or talk each other, people had to move their body to other person. and if someone live in different continent across the ocean, they had to ride a boat and they could die because of oceanic disaster or disease. But nowadays. people live in different country easily see their face or here their voice thanks to computer network. and they cooperate each other sending feedbacks or files. 
So in conclusion, Although there are many side effects of computer, I think computer improved our life. computer made so many important or difficult things easy or possible.  "	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"Some people say that computers make life more complex and stressful because people spend much time to use them. However, I think computers are useful for our lives. There are a couple of reasons as follows.
    First, you can find out much information as fast as you can. When you search some information using books, you should check every chapter. After then, you should find out what chapter contains the contents that we want to search. It takes much time to find out and read. However, when you use a keyword in google, there is a bunch of data there. If you have to look at some book, you can use e-book. Just typing Ctrl and F keys makes you find out the data which you need. You don't have to look at every content of the book. Next, you can save time to see people using computers. There are a couple of social media in internet. You can keep in touch in those social media with your friends. If you use video chat, you can see your friends face to face. it is useful for not only friends, but also business meeting. If you don't have proper place to accommodate a bunch of people, you can use video chat. You can talk about your opinions, listen to others' opinions and announce something you want. Last, you can enjoy various activities in computers. There exist not only games, but also virtual realities and movies these days. You are able to become other person, go paragliding and everything. You can spend your time efficiently if you make good use of computers.
    In conclusion, I agree that computers are helpful for our lives because you can find out information fast, communicate to others with less time and enjoy your free time with effect. Therefore, I think people should know how to utilize computers well in their lives. If you misspend your time now, you should find out more efficient way to use them."	2.5	1	2.5	6

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"I contend that computer bring better life to human. The reason is why, first, we can get a lot of information easily by using computer. When we access internet by computer, we can easily get information what we want by searching keywords. It is big difference with other media, because it is very inconvenient to find proper information in most of other media, for instance, book or television. 
 Second, computer can do things that human cannot do. Computer has very high calculation speed and accuracy, and it can handle a lot of input information in same time. Therefore, we can save or handle data easily and accurately by using computer. For example, factory can be automated using the function of the computer. Also, it is helpful for running simulations in experiment, like launching rocket. 
 Exactly, computer has several disadvantages. However, computers are useful tools with greater advantages. Because the tool rely on how you use it, if you use the computer improperly, it will give disadvantage, but if you use it well, computer will give convenient life. By these reasons, I think that computers make our life convenient and richer."	1.5	2	2	5.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, we can have easier and more convenient life because of the improvement of not only computer but also mobile phone technology. I also agree with this statement.  Actually, we can do lots of things using computer. I think that computer disappeared suddenly, many people can not do anything.
 First of all, many people use the internet, so lots of information is on the internet. We can get almost information that we need through the computer. I'll give an example. When I do my task, I don't know how to use some functions of the program. But I can learn the function using Youtube. Also, learning how to make some foods, or finding the words that I don't know is much easier with computer. I think that these things might be difficult without computer. So computer makes us find information much easier.
 Next, we can do many things anywhere using computer. When I was young, we should buy a movie ticket in the theater and order food through calling. But, today we can do these things with just one click. Also, we can have a class without going to the real classroom. Computer makes all these things possible.
 Today, I discussed about the benefits of the computer. According to the improvement of the computer technology, our lives are becoming more convenient. For these reasons, I think that computers are necessary for today's people. I expect that the better computer technology, the easier life we can get."	2	2.5	2	6.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"I agree with the opinion that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Of course, there might be opinions that communication between humans has decreased due to the increase in time spent using computers, and it makes life stressful because humans get the vitality of life by communicating with others. But there are also many cases where communication has become more active due to computers.
 First, let me explain in more detail the reasons for this. Now, by COVID-19, there are a lot of risks when it comes to face-to-face classes. But, by using computers, we can communicate well like face-to-face classes. In this way, computers can continue to provide educational opportunities to students while eliminating risks during a pandemic.
 Moreover, with the development of metaverse technology, most things that can be done in the real world can be performed in a virtual environment. This brings great benefits to our lives because we are not constrained by time and space.
 In summary, the development of computers has made our lives easier and more convenient by breaking the constraints. Let's use computers properly to increase our life vitality."	1.5	2.5	2	6

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"It is quite difficult to imagine a world without computers in recent times. These revolutionary machine no longer exists only in desktop form. They are in phones, speakers, cars, and even in home furniture. Some argue that the computers have made our daily life more complex and stressful, which is hard to agree with. Compared to the tremendous convenience brought by computers, their claims are not seeing the woods for the trees.
  One of their arguments is that information is overflowing due to the development of media induced by the computers. In the beginning of the information era, it is true that many people have suffered from the flood of information. However, our discernment are improved by receiving lots of information from computers. The development of technology is increasingly providing personalized information suitable for individuals. In addition, algorithms for filtering high-quality information are being developed. So the overflow of information is nothing more than a temporary chaos in the transitional period. Also, most of the problems that we feel our daily life are complicated by computers are caused by interfaces. So the problems are not the computers."	2.5	2	3	7.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"The appearance of computer have changed the life of humans on all sides. The affairs that are treated by face-on-face like Bank affairs, lectures, purchasing and selling, and so on,  can be treated on-line by computer. By the computer, it is certain that long time consumed tasks can be solved simply and rapidly and the limitation of physical distances is overcome. However, to the contrast, there are generations who can't follow the speed of development of computer. These mainly consists of older people. They feel stressful and struggled to the electrical devices and even some of them says the life before the computer was more efficient to treat. Why this unbalanced situation happens?
  Above all, it is because of the education. For the new generation, there is a class to teach how to treat computer in the elementary course. This lecture helps students get accustomed to the computer and easily react to the newly invented techniques. Also, they faced the computer from early years, it is natural that they are surrounded by the computer.
  However, it is totally different to older generations. For them, there was no education about computer. In addition, since they were already accustomed to the way of manly treated tasks, it was a challenge for them to change their way of life. The gap between life before computer and life after computer increases dramatically, and at that result, these old generation became the computer il-literal.
  To sum up, for the new generations who got a continuing and intensive education of computer feel comfortable with computer and agree to computer makes life easier. But, to the old generation, who didn't get the education of computer, computer is too difficult and complex tools. It is clearly true that computer makes the things impossible before possible and the computer will not disappear foresight. Therefore, the social supports not only for new generation but also for old generation should be focused to decrease the computer il-literacy."	1.5	2	2.5	6

Online lectures with computers are trends nowadays. This is impossible without personal-computers. In addition, we can run several programs on computers. We need lots of software programs in our life. It could be office programs for work, internet programs for communicate, and game programs for our free time.

First, computers allow us to do things indoors. Internet connects all of the computers worldwide. It is a huge benefit in daily life. For example, we can talk with a friend who lives in another country on skype or discord. Also, zoom classes will continue until the corona era ends. All the necessary works, such as internet banking or shopping can be settled by the computer. This made life convenient and simple. 
Second, computers provide various entertainments. Based on the internet, we can interact with numerous game users around the world. Also, we can listen to music or watch Netflix and youtube. Playing with a computer is one of the most efficient and most convenient time-killers of all time. 
Last, the high-end calculating performance of computers is irreplaceable. Various research fields are using computer calculations. For example, rocket trajectory is calculated by computer. Also, diverse computer simulations are used to obtain data. Nowadays, almost all scientific work cannot be progressed without computers. In other words, the development of computers accelerated scientific progress. This is making life convenient."	2	2.5	2.5	7
928	Tech: Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"In nowadays, computer becomes necessary component in our life. We spent most of time with computers and computer-like electronic devices. Let's think about that how our life looks like if all those devices disappear. It will becomes some kind of disaster or like some kind of disaster movie. We cannot attend online class, use on-line shopping and delivery service and cannot use many other services. And from next section, I'll talk about computer-dependency in various regions of our life, in more detail.

  First, computers make us free from doing complex calculation or mathmatical computation task by our hand. We need to handle that kind of tasks from our every-day life (pay for buying products, etc..) to highly-technological tasks (doing research, etc..). And computers can do those tasks very fast and efficiently, so we can save our time and can develop very high-level systems that cannot be operated with only humans, that needs very fast-and large amount of computations. That means that in nowadays, most high-level human technology developed based on the use of computer. One of the feasible example of the AI (artificial intelligence), which requires a huge amount of computations. Before the computer performance is developed as high like nowadays, even if the concept of AI was proposed about 40 years ago,  it cannot be implemented. So, with computational power of computer, we can develop that kinds of new-technology, which changes our life in much more convenience way.

 The more closer example to our everyday-life is that most of our workspace need computers to be used. We need to make various papers and documents, and share those papers through web. However, without computer, it should be written by our hand, and shared by humans. Then, it requires much more manpower to do the same jobs, with slower speed. Also,  tasks that require visual representation of image will show much more quality differences.

 So, if we think that above examples without computers, our life will be much harder."	2	2.5	2.5	7

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"We live among a lot of computers. There are many types of computers such as a desktop, a laptop, a mobile phone and so on. Now, we can't think our life without computers. I think that computers have made our life easier and more convenient definitely. The reasons are as follows.
 First at all, we can overcome the limitation of time and space. Now days, we have been regulated our meeting because of Covid-19. The lecture can't be conducted face to face. However, we can conduct our lecture by using computers. This example is one of the evidence of overcoming the limitation of space.
 Second, we can save our money by using computers. Japan is one of the rich countries all over the world. However, they had reduced their money to invest for computers. They still our old things like stamps. Japan's economic growth keeps decreasing. Using computers is more efficient than using old things.
 Third, the works with computers are more reliable. When we need to calculate a lot, we have to calculate multiple times to reduce our mistakes. However, the computers don't conduct any errors if the program works properly. Usually, we think that using computers is more reliable. 
 Finally, there are several examples that computers are used to help people who have some difficulties. For example, they is a computer which reads the sentences in a book for people who can not see. It is necessary to read books for them. Computers are 'hope' for them.
 Of course, the computers are complex sometimes. However, it's because the computers are not perfect to use yet, but not the computers are not useful. If the computers are more developed in the future, it would be less complex than now days. There are lots of working to use computers less complex. Researchers make user interface changes by developing software and invent the new type of computers like foldable mobile phone. I believe that the computers will be more and more important as the technology develops."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

The world is full of computers, and we use them so many times even unconsciously. They brought us a big convenience in many ways such as calculating complicated execution. There are more cases of how computers made our lives easier including the two following reasons.
     First, the smartphone. There is no person who doesn't have it. It has replaced a lot of parts of human life. We don't have to hand-write a letter, collect and remember all the phone numbers, and find a way to our destination. Because of the big convenience that the smartphone has brought, it is also known as the external brain. I cannot even imagine a life without it.
     Next, computers gave us the opportunity to keep learning. Due to COVID-19, most of the students could not take the lecture offline. However, we could continue to take it and see friends online. It has been possible since the fully developed computer technology. In addition, we can get a lot of information without any cost by simply watching YouTube videos. It is an innovation in learning area.
     All in all, computers have helped us to live easier lives in many ways. Now we cannot even imagine going back to the generation which had not used them."	2.5	2.5	3	8

The orders for the store is done through Internet and the transaction of bitcoin and stock which are considered as important and uprising money cannot be done. All things that make our live convenient is from Internet. If there is some error on Internet, computer network, the world will fall into chaos. 
 Recently, the case to prove the importance of Internet happens. Do you remember the 'KT internet failure accident'? I did experience the chaos. At that time of October 25th, I took the class via Zoom meeting. Suddenly, all the people including professor was disconnected. I was fortune to have Internet based on other wire service. At the end, the class was end, not finishing all class contents. Not only me, but also most of other people who are especially restaurant owner, entrepreneur, student got damage and experienced severe inconvenience.  
 This was the well suited case for Internet necessity to our life. Due to this contemporary chaos, we do realize that usual easy, fast life has come from the Internet. The fast communication between people abroad, untact class for COVID-19 situation, transaction of cryptocurrency and stock, and KaKao maps, Coupang which is essential application for our lives is the product of Internet."	1	1	2.5	4.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"I agree with computers have made life easier and more convenient. There are 3 reasons.
First, computers can memory and store so much information. We can save our word or ppt files,
many pictures and videos. Maybe in general, we can store over 1TB memories on computer and we never can not
remember this quantity in our heads. However, we always check and remember so much memories with computers. It takes convenience to us.
Second, computers never make mistakes. Sometimes, or usually we make mistakes. Simple calculations, memory something or etc. However, computers never do wrong calculations and never forget memories if there is no error or bug. Thus, we can more less pay attention to calculating or remember. It makes our life easier.
Last, third one is computers generated development of industry. By computers, many industry changed handwork to mechanization and automation. It occurs increasing of productivity and quality. Also, Industries are accelerated and we do not need manpower as before. We can use remaining time in other parts like leisure or etc. This makes our life easier and in abundance.

  First, computers make things faster. Because of computer, it is possible to do some tasks at home without going to community service center or something. So it became much more convenient for our time usage and not going to community center which is annoying.
  Second, computers have many functions. Computers have several convenient functions like calculating or drawing. There were many things that are too complicated to finish on our own, but thanks to many functions of computers, it became available to deal with those tasks. We can calculate complex numbers with computers, and draw an ideal circle with computers.
  Because of these things, I think that computers have made our life easier and more convenient. Definitely, there are some disadvantages occurred by computers, but I think the advantages that computers give can cancel out the disadvantages of computers.

It shows that the excessive using of computer becomes a social problem, and people recognize it today. However, I think computers have made our life better especially nowadays. Here are some reasons.

First of all, thanks to computers, we can maintain our life even in pandemic situation. From the 2019 spring semester, I studied via the computer. Because I have a computer, I could meet people and get good quality lectures. If there are no computers, we could not do anything related to studying last two years.
Second, if we use it appropriately, computers help us to relax. There are some thinking that computers accumulate stress. However, for my case, I relieve my stress by playing the computer games. So it is not right that using computers is always harmful to our mental.
Lastly, computers make our lives extremely convenient. I did not go the bank during last several years. It is because I can do any banking job with a computer. If we could not use computers, we should do everything in offline, and it might be much stressful.

For these reasons, I believe that computers help our lives, and are absolutely essential in our life."	3	3	2.5	8.5

Even though some people says that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I think that computers have made life easier and more convenient. There are 3 reasons  why I think that computers have made life easier and convenient.
First of all, computer helps us to manage our time more efficiently. By using computer, we can synchronize many thing in convenient way. By just simple settings, we can manage our works with calendar in the computer. In contrast to usual paper calendar or diary, which need some effort to update new schedule or modify previous schedule, we can update and modify our schedule very quickly with our computer. In addition, we can share our schedule in convenient way.
Second, computer can finish a lot of simple repeat work very fast. In real world life, we encounter many kinds of repeat work. Paying something that have to be payed periodically or counting the D-day are kind of this works. By using computer, we can achieve our requirement with small effort, and this thing can be repeated until we want to finish it. 
Finally, we can find out lots of information through the internet with computers. On the internet, there is lots of information which might be helpful for us. Although there is some unverified information which might be harmful, with some effort to avoid them, we can save a lot of time to find out information compared to traditional information searching techniques.

Maybe it's because my house computer wasn't good. However, many people should pay a lot of money for using good performance computers. On the other side, nowadays, we can buy computers easier and its basic performances are very good. That is, we can use good computers easier and makes our life more convenient.
Firstly, we can carry computers such as laptop or tablet. Surely, laptop's performance is worse than desktop's. But, desktops can't be carried because it's weight and mechanical issues. So, many people use laptop for using outside. Thus, we can use computers not only in house, but even in cafe, park and everywhere. 
Secondly, computer's speed are getting faster. Compared to several years before, computer's turn-on time is very faster. Also, loading time is very few for most of light operations. That is, people can do anything in very short time. 
Finally, it can save time and bothers. For modern people, time is very important. Many modern people don't have enough time to go shopping or do hobbies. But, nowadays, we can buy any items with just some clicks. We can also do shopping even lying down on the bed. 
Some people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. But, nowadays, they will feel more inconvenient not to enjoy computer's good functions. Also, many people feel difficult to use computers. However, it's getting easier and there are many custom computers for minorities. That is, not only elders but also kids can use computers easier.

All the classes these days are conducting in Zoom, your vaccine data is managed by government system, you listen to music with your mobile phone, et cetera. Now it is hard to imagine the world before the invention of computer. Despite these advantages of computer, some people argues that computer have made life more complex and stressful. This is controversial topic, and I firmly believe that computer have our life easier and more convenient.
First, computer made our life much more energetic. Most to medias are accessible through computer. You can listen to billboard chart by just clicking the playlist in YouTube music. You can watch famous series 'Sherlock' by subscribing Netflix. And people all over the worlds are fanatical of Korean show 'Squid Game'. Before the computer has invented, the art was only preserved by the riches. Thanks to computer, however, you can watch every master pieces of worlds with your small mobile phone. It is obvious that computer has enhance the quality of life of mankind, by providing the fascinating medias and artworks.
Second, the computers are saving your life. Especially computers are inevitable in this pandemic situation. You know, all the university classes have studied Zoom, and most of meetings these days are in Google Meet. This is all in the virtue of the computer. There are more examples. You can reserve vaccine by NAVER,  and your vaccination records are all managed by COOV app. Imagine how can we overcome this tragic pandemic without help of the computers!
As you can see in the examples above, computers are indispensable with our everyday life. Human civilisation has developed very rapidly after the invention of computer, and a lot of world data are stored in the computer. It is obvious that world without computer will be extremely horrible. In some aspect, it is also true that computers have made life more complex and stressful. However I argue that the advantage of computer is overwhelming, compared to the disadvantage."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"A Computer has been the most innovative invention today. Almost every people in the world use computers in their everyday lives. In this regard, I think that computers have made life easier and more convenient.
    First, they provide helpful programs. For example, PPT or Word developed by Microsoft help us to make presentations or documents easier. Without them, we have to draw all presentation materials and write every text with our hands, which is too complicated.
    Second, they allow us to communicate with each other. Compters include smart devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches. By using them, we can send a message or give a call wherever. Moreover, recent Internet of Things (IoT) computers allow us to communicate with house appliances. For example, we can remotely control an air conditioner or a refrigerator outside the home.
    For these two reasons, I firmly believe that computers have made our lives much more easier and convenient."	2.5	2.5	3	8

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"I think computers have made life easier and more convenient. Most of the people use computers everyday. They can check the weather, see the news, and watch Youtube channels using their computers. For example, students can attend their online classes in the home without going to the actual class. Employees can also stay in the house and collaborate with their co-workers freely. This phenomenon is so popular these days so that no one would doubt that computers have made our life more convenient. There are more reasons why computers have made life easier and more convenient. Let's take a look those one by one.
 First, we can get useful information in the Internet easily. If you want to find more information, you can just google it and find the answer. You can search your career goal, daily life of other people, and the keywords you didn't know. Without computers, we might have to go to the library and read books to get information that takes us more time and effort.
 Second, we can watch more entertainment videos like Youtube channels. In the past, TVs and radios were the only thing we can watch. However, we can watch Youtube channels, play games online, and chat with friends these days. There are so much more entertaining stuffs online so that it made us to just sit down in the chair and enjoy them.
 To sum up, computers made us to find information quickly and provided many entertaining materials so that it made our life easier and more convenient."	2	2	2.5	6.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"Since the invention of the computer, the world has developed rapidly due to its great computational power. Such a computer-related life makes life easier and more convenient for some people, but it also seen by others as  a more complex and stressful life. Between two opposing opinions, I think computers make our lives more convenient.
  The first reason I agree with the opinion above is that it makes easier to get information. We use navigation to drive through the best route while driving, and we also use our cell phone to search for wonderful restaurants or view the arrival times of public transport. Since the various electronic devices mentioned in the examples are kinds of computer, we can easily obtain various information through the computer in our daily life and use it to live more comfortable life.
 A second reason for supporting the above opinion is that computers allow for more efficient work. A few years ago, a public service worker from KAIST took charge of what he had to do for a half year, eight hours a day. A story of a social service worker from KAIST who completed his half-year work in a day using a program is a typical example of this. In addition, there are so many cases in which computers finish their work much faster than humans do themselves, which shows that computers make human life more convenient.
 In conclusion, I agree with the opinion that computers make our lives easier and more convenient because using computers makes getting information easier and more efficient. I finish this article in the hope that computers will develop further and have a more comfortable life."	3	3.5	3.5	10

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I think that the way of specializing in one subject is much better than the way of taking several kinds of subject. I have some supports for my opinion.
First, specialists are more needed in the modern society. Nowadays' problem that we are facing is really complicated and huge one. So there's no one who can take care of every problems. Instead, lots of specialists cooperate to address a one big problem, with solving small, but complicated components of the big problem. Even though it is important that having knowledge of broad areas, but it is needed in managing between specialists.
Second, knowledge of modern society is too deep and wide to cover all of it. about 2 or 3 centuries ago, scholars in that era studied about lots of areas; mathematics, physics, and chemistry and so on. But as humans accumulate their knowledge, the research area had became deeper and more complex than past days. In example, mathematician of 18th century Gauss studied about algebra, statistics, etc. But in 21th century, the mathematicians study their own, narrow but deep area. So we can think that studying broad area can be helpful, but in the long run, that way only makes incompetitive ones, due to this property of modern studies.
There are some opinions of training transdisciplinary talents. But I argue that such education is incompetitive in modern era. So I think being specialist is much better than taking several kinds of subjects."	3	3	3	9

"Even though COVID-19 and its mutation virus situation is getting longer, KAIST decided to do face-on-face classes. Some students would disagree with this decision,  but I think university students should required to attend classes in two reasons.
First of all, there are experimental classes in college. At last year, we've join the chemistry experimental class and physics experimentsl class. Many students were looking forward at these classes. However, experimental classes were conducted in online, all we have to do was write a report after receiving the test result. This circumstance shows that person-to-person class is important for experimental classes. These classes has a goal to have a experience about student's  jobs, students should attend classes.
In fact, attend classes is not only important in experimental classes.  While school is doing online lecture, I saw many students doing other things while they taking the lecture. Even if they get a high score at midterm and final exam, it could become bad habits. Also, lecture includes not only knowledge about lecture but also other useful knowledge, professor's skills, and advice for life. This point is depends on the lecture's subject, but aren't we taking lectures just to gain knowledge?
To sum up, experimental classes and other lecture classes both are required to attend. Attending class makes lecture as a lecture, and experience of experiment. For this reason, I think university students should be required to attend classes."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" It has been a long issue that whether universities should require students to take classes in many subjects or one subject. I claim that letting students take classes in various subject is a better choice.

 First, students will have more options to choose for their dreams. The majority of students in university doesn't have a job yet. They should be finding which subject will suit their aptitude. Studying many subjects will increase the possibility to find aptitudes for students. 

 Next, studying only one subject is dangerous. Usually, students will study in university for 4 years. If a student realizes that the subject doesn't suit for himself or herself, it would be miserable because time passed more than other students. So it will be safer to study many subjects because if one doesn't suit, students can try others.

 Finally, it is possible to converge two or more subjects to one. Integrating contents of subjects can make new ideas and conclusions. Studying many subjects deep as possible will help students to bring up fresh ideas. For example, Steve Jobs integrated Arts and Technology to make beautiful electronic devices and it successes a lot.

 In conclusion, universities should require students to take classes in many subjects. This will make university to help students to find their goals. Furthermore, it can provide possibilities of letting students integrate ideas of subjects."	3	3	3	9

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" University is an educational institute for professional knowledges. There is a big differance between it and other academies. Most of them are adult, who has right to determine what they do freely. Because of this reason, many students want to be optional for their class to get their right. However, adults should be respective for their choice taken by their right. I will suggest my disagreement on this side.
  As I said, the main purpose of universites is education. They are built to make specialized people  in some fields. Therefore, all of students in university have a mandatory to be a important person who knows enough to develop our society.  Even though we give some tuition to them, we also take a lot of supplyments for our education. Our classes are not the service that we can give up anytime, but mandatory caused by our own choice. So it is very sure that we must be checked about how we implement our mandatory well.
 There's another reason. Many companies and jobs take there standards for new people on the grade of university. They can evaluate applicants by what they learn or  do in the university. In this way, evaluation is also a function of university. Because of it, every freshmen already tacitly contracted to be evaluated by all of behaviors in the university. Attandance is the most basic and good criteria for evaluation, so professors can get their right to examine it.
 In these reasons, I confirmly agree for  the attendance requiring. Someone can have dissatisfaction for this policy, but it is essential for  all people who live in the society. Attandance is a promise that we already agreed when we register in the university, and we have to respect for it."	3	3	3.5	9.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" We heard of some people who had success in their own field like Leonardo da Vinci or Einstein. However, did these people succeed because they did well on only one subject? I think not. My opinion is that universities requiring students to take classes in many subjects.
 First, students can improve their understanding with knowledge from other subjects related to their major. For example, Leonardo da Vinci is famous for his work in painting but surprisingly, he also majored in anatomy. And many historians say that understanding the shape of human body through anatomy played a key role when Leonardo da Vinci painted people. It is same for us. You can go much farther in you field by studying related subjects together.
 Next, students can create a whole new field by integrating a few subjects they were studying. What I mean is, that each of students can be a pioneer in their own fields. For example, NFT is a concept rised recently that for each internet-based creation, people verify that it is an original one. And NFT is important nowadays because there are so many copied files in the web. Concept of NFT can be understood as a combination of Internet/Computing, copyright, and also blockchain system. Like this, students can come up with groundbreaking concept if they take classes even not directly related to their major.
 To conclude, it is both helpful for students to study various subjects related to their major or not. Students can use their wide knowledge to improve theirselves or to open a new realm."	3.5	3.5	3	10

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" I think that the university that requires students to take classes in many subjects is better than the other.
 To be first, spending times in lots of subjects can make synergy in studying. Most of Subjects tend to be connected with something such as hypothesis, theorem or problem each other. So we can see those again and again, and remember more exactly and understand better. For example, Physics and Mathematics cannot be independent each other. In Physics, a lot of topics would be explained and resulted by Mathematics. Also, we remind topics in solving Mathematics problem which is related to Physics. Doing them together, something rack can be complemented and something good can be reinforced. Then the ability and score for two subjects will increase together rather than studying just one. 
 Secondly, We could get interested in another field (especially not my field which is studying now), with taking many classes. It is reasonable to get a subject of another field rather than to get only subjects of my field. Having that class, we get a lot of information. In that course, interest about some field will come to us and we will search more information to satisfy our interest. Finally, the major can be changed, or a couple of major could be done together. Information that we have got can be used someday, for example, the innovative study topic can be found thanks to the theory of another field.
 Taking many subjects can make synergy together and get interested in another field. So I regard my claim is better than the other."	3	3	3	9

"Nowadays, the discussion that university students should be required to attend classes is very hot topic. And each side of the discussion has a reasonable reason about their statement. And I'm in side of supporting the statement. I think that university students should be required to attend classes for two reasons.
 The first reason is the fact that university is a facility to study. And I think it means university should have some power to force students to study, and I think that made university students required to attend class is the best way to force students to study. Some people may say that university students should have freedom about this subject. But I think that if we give university students freedom, most of students will spend their time on playing game, or meeting their friends, rather than studying, resulting to university lost it's meaning of facility to study. In this reason, I suppose that university students should be required to attend classes.
 The second reason is that attending  class can give a lot of positive effects to the students. First they can study. University students can learn what they wanted to study, but cannot learn in highschool. In addition, they can learn about the subject they like more deeper than they learned in highschool. Second, they can meet new friends by attending class. And this can give students a chance to socialize with new people, and this can be lead to growth of sociality, the ability that essential in nowadays.
In short, I think that university students should be required to attend classes because first, university needs a power to force students to study, and second, attending classes gives many adventages to students. "	3	3.5	3	9.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"In most classes, attending classes is essential. Professors may want student to study hard in the lecture and to improve their abilities. But does everyone attending classes doing their work hard and improve their abilities? My answer is NO. I insist that we should give a chance to decide whether to take a class or not.
 The first reason of my opinion is the right to choose. University students are already mature enough to decide what to do for themselves. They already decided the lectures they want to take part in, so we should also give a chance to decide whether to attend or not.
 Also, those who will study hard will study hard, and those who won't study hard will not. It doesn't help to force the students who don't have any will to study to attend the class. But, the students who have great will to study hard, most of them take classes even if the professor don't force attendance.
 Lastly, there can be gifted students who already know about whole class' contents or theories. Or, the students who do that subject so well that they don't have to take the class, for example, basic courses. It is a waste of time for these students to attend lectures as essential. It is more efficient for them to study other things without attending classes at that time.
 We should give students chances to decide attending classes or not. Give them freedom of choice, and they should take responsibility. For these reasons, I insist that going to classes should be optional for students. "	3	3	3	9

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Taking classes in various subject would be better for students than specializing in one specific subject. 3 years of highschool course is not enough for students to acknowledge what they are good at, which means there are needs for additional time to spend seeking their dreams. Also, specializing makes it harder to change one's subject for student, making talented students to stay in other subjects. 
University should give more time for students to think about their major or carear, as highschool period is not enough for students to acknowledge themselves. It is too short, and most of the effort is poured at colledge admission, leaving literally no time for students to find what they are good at and what they really like. One might say that students learn many different things at highschool, which is enough for them to choose their major and carear. However, what highschool students have learned is too shallow and elementry for real jobs. Extra time is needed for students and that should be university couse. If not, there is a chance that one talented student ending up at other carear where he/she is not as good. Even though one found their talent, it would be hard for them to move their major. Because if they do choose to change, it would take twice as much time. Also, university that is specialized, usually don't allow students to change their course easily.
Specializing one's major is the same as forcing young students to pick a subject that they don't know if they would have talent in it. This situation should be avoided as this is a big loss for both the student and university."	3	3	3	9

I am the one of whom agree this statement is better. There are basically three reasons that made this statement agreeable to me.
   First, many freshmen don't know precisely what to do in the future. They were forced to make a dream when young, and some of them don't like the dream what they had chosen. If universities haven't required students to do basic stuffs, then even if students when they become those who are not freshmen anymore, it may be hard to study specific subjects that are related to their specialties because they haven't studied well earlier before.
   Second, even if the subjects are not those students would like to study, for example, I had the same situation but later in my life(?) those knowledge that I ignored are useful when talking with others like friends, family, people when meeting for the first time. It must be useful in the future.
    Lastly, science-related subjects are connected to each other quite a lot than we expect. Physics is used in biology when talking about the blood pressure, used in chemistry like potential energy in electrons, and etc. It might be dangerous to say, but I personally think that studying only a few subjects is a foolish thing to do. Learning is always a positive factor to our lives.
   Maybe studying few subjects that people would like to study hard for their longing is a good thing to do because of the concentration of focus, but in the other side, it might be that people know only about those subjects and the pool they live in would be smaller than those who studied many subjects."	3	3	3.5	9.5

Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"If I need to choose between learning many subjects or one subject, I think specializing in many subjects is better than in one subject for the following reasons. 

First, by learning many subjects you can understand each subject better. For example, physics and mathematics are very closely intertwined. By studying physics, you may find out how equations you've learned from mathematics are applied, find a solution to the problem you were struggling with within mathematics, and so on. And this is true in other cases like when studying world history. So it is obvious that learning other subjects helps you to learn the one you were studying first. 
Second, you can broaden your sight of the world by studying many subjects. When you only specialize in one subject, you might be an influential person in that area, but you're not seeing the world in full sight. In my case, not just science,  but ethics, philosophy, and other things are needed in our life and they must be learned of course. From the experiences you've got from learning many subjects, your life will be more satisfactory and you'll be able to make the right decision in time you need to decide where to go or what to do in your life. 
Lastly, in my opinion, the person 21st century needs more is the one who knows how to share what he or she got, cause now is the time when all the subjects cant be separated which means all the things we're doing are always intertwined. It might sound odd and you could think ""I don't get it! Each subject has its meaning and you can go just well only specializing in one subject."" Well, it might have been true in the past, but time passed and the world changed. You have to adjust to the world. In my opinion, studying many subjects is inevitable. Also, the ability to share what you got is important, and to do this you need help from other subjects. How to communicate, to make a world a better place and etc.  
For these reasons, I think specializing in many subjects is better. In a rapidly changing world in the 21st, it is important to learn many subjects."	3	3.5	3.5	10

     Recently, many discussions regarding how to educate students have been made. One topic in the discussion is about whether students have to specialize in one subject or take classes in various subjects. In my opinion, specializing in one subject is much better than taking classes in many subjects for several reasons.
     First, modern society requires specialists in one field rather than transdisciplinary talents. Nowadays problem that we have to solve is really complicated and is a really large one. This implies that finding someone who can take care of all parts of the problem is impossible. Instead of one convergence talent, lots of experts from various areas cooperate to handle one big problem by solving small, but complex components of the problem. Therefore, specializing in one area is important to handle modern complicated problems.
     Next, training experts is more efficient. Knowledge of modern society is too deep and wide to cover all areas. About 2 or 3 centuries ago, scholars of that era studied about many areas; mathematics, physics, and chemistry and so on; however, as humans accumulate their knowledge, the research area has become deeper and more complex than in past days. This fact makes educating enough level of convergence talent much harder. However, training experts takes much lower costs and is easier than training convergence talents. To sum up, specializing in one subjects can produce more competitive researchers.
     Some argue that training leaders who can understand and integrate ideas from various area is more important in modern era; however, such talented leaders can be easily replaced by cooperation of experts. Nowadays, the leader who can point the way to proceed and manage every component of work is vanishing. Instead, cooperation of specialists takes its place. Modern problems can be handled by cooperation of many specialists. Therefore, it is more beneficial to train specialists than transdisciplinary leaders.
     In conclusion, educating experts in one field is more efficient, and fits to current trend. In modern era, training convergence talents is not competitive anymore. Therefore, we should encourage students to specialize in one subject than taking multiple kinds of subjects."	4	4	4.5	12.5

     Students register for classes for the first time after coming to college. Schools no longer schedule classes for students, so they have to decide which classes to take on their own. However, each university has different requirements for graduation. Some universities are required to take classes in various subjects, but others are required to take classes on one subjects. In my opinion, listening to lectures in various subjects has two advantages
     First of all, helpful to college students when they decide a major. Most college students come to university without a major. Sometimes even students who are sure of their major usually change their major after they come to university. This is because students take some lectures at the university, look at their aptitude, taste, and future prospects, and decide on their major. At this point, listening to lectures in various subjects allows students to make more successful major choices.
     In addition, having advantages for job competition after students graduated. Those who have studied one field and several fields have different level of knowledge even if the number of lectures they have taken is same. When students encounter various fields, they can look at one problem in many ways. This make students to suggest various solutions. Additionally, taking many class allows for convergent thinking that simultaneously considers knowledge in different fields. Convergent thinking is an important factor in getting a job at future-oriented companies. Therefore, it is important to encounter various majors in order to gain an upper hand in the competition.
     Some argues that coming into contact with various classes delays college graduation because of lecture unrelated with graduation. I agree that taking lecture from various majors can delay graduation. However, this argument exclude rewards obtained instead of delaying graduation. As graudation is delayed, students will be able to develop a wider lange of knowledge and convergent-complex thinking. Above all, the lectures that college studnets took in other fields will open up a lot of course when they went to graduate school or got a job.
     To sum up, listening to lectures in various subjects has the advantages of helping major selection and job competition. Access to various major lectures allows college students to choose their interests, aptitiudes, and appropriate majors. In addition, it fosters a wide range of knowledge and convergent problem-solving skills, which gives it an advantage in job competition. Getting a lot of lecture can delay graduation, but it has many advantages offsetting it. Considering these points, it seems that it is better to encounter various lectures than to take only one major lecture."	4.5	4.5	4	13

Introduction:
             It has been controversial in many universities nowadays if they should make students specifically study one subject or experience many subjects throughout university life. 
Even though there are some advantages having experience in various field, it is better to focus study on one subject because of the efficiency.  
            First of all, it is better for student to invest their study on one particular subject because the subject itself became more complicated as the higher course is taken. Moreover, the time that students get to learn is limited. Thus, it will be better for students ti focus at one particular subject. As an example, to know about chemistry department in general, knowing the organic compounds that is taught in basic mandatory classes is not enough to understand the essential of chemistry. Hence, it is better to focus on one subject during studies.
            Secondly, focusing on one subject put a real meaning on degree that is given to students. As stated before that each subject has different depths;  so, the more higher courses students take, the more complexity the class would offer.  As an example, if someone would majored in chemical engineering but during their study, they study other field which decrease the opportunity to focus on particular subject. Rather than jumping out on subjects that only cover the subject on the surface, it is better to go deeper in particular subject. Thus, students could graduate with degree that actually declare their education.
            Lastly, it is better to know a field professionally rather than a surface knowledge of many subjects. As an example, a 
            Some might argue that mandating students to choose only one subject might reduce the opportunity of learning new subjects. However, the knowledge in studies is not fully . As an example, a physics student already learned thermodynamics through some subjects offered in physics department, but in material science engineering, thermodynamics

     There is an interesting proverb; “You should dig a single hole.” It means that students should be specialized in only one subject because they can fail to accomplish anything if they try to study various subjects.  In my opinion, however, it is too old proverb to apply for contemporary society and students should learn wide range subjects.
     The first reason is that most of projects in nowadays requires fusion of different subjects. For example, scientist makes new material by imitating a tissue of organisms. It requires both biology and chemical engineering. For this project, scientists should know about small parts of both subjects at least even though they are not an expert of the other subjects. If students study only one subject, they cannot process these projects.
     The second reason is that it is hard to be specialized in one subject well if students do not know about others. Many high-end technologies are developed by cooperation of scientists specialized in various parts. Therefore, it is hard to understand anything in a frontier of every subjects unless they know about wide range subjects.
     Some people say that taking classes in many subjects is not effective because it requires too much time and money. However, it is not a serious problem to stop to teach various subjects. Students can learn a lot of knowledges and techniques, so they can be more experienced and used in various tasks. The time and money to teach them are not a waste, but an investment to get a greater result.
     In conclusion, it is a best way to makes students take classes in many subjects. Even though it was better to teach only one subject because it was not effective due to the high cost and time consume, in nowadays, it is much better to teach various subjects due to the change of the society and effectivity of this typeof education."	4	4	4	12

     There are some people who majored in two or more subjects in universities. There are other people who specialized in one subject. Universities can guide how many subjects they choose as their major. In my opinion, universities should require students to take classes in many subjects.
     First of all, studying many subjects can help students succeed in their fields. Knowledge from one subject might be helpful to understand some concepts in other subjects, and improve their skills. For example, Leonardo da Vinci was able to paint or make sculptures because he studied anatomy. Also, students may find a breakthrough to a problem. 
     In addition, students can mix up the knowledge and create their own field. In recent world, student setting up his or her own value is a key factor to success. Mixing up some subjects can be helpful. For example, if combined with computer science, subjects thought to be dead can regain its vitality. Studying various subjects can increase the chance to grab creative and interesting idea.
     Some argue that the effort needed to study multiplies if students study many subjects; however, it is not that much. Students should also invest a lot of time and effort to specialize in one subject. The amount of achievement students gain from equal amount of effort decreases as they study more and more. Studying multiple subjects with certain amount level is might be easier than being the best in one subject. 
     To sum up, universities should require students to take classes in many subjects. It not only makes students to do well in their fields, but also create whole new field and be pioneers. Also, it requires the same or little more effort compared to specializing in one subject. Students can become a preferred resources in societies."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

     Most secondary school students decide to enter an university. Universities can be divided into two groups with respect to a number of classes. Some universities require only one class for a semester, and others expect students to taking various classes. Some argue that requiring only one class is sufficient for students. In my opinion, however, universities that require them to take several classes are better than those requiring only one class for two reasons.
     First of all, taking various lectures can provide synergy for students. Most fields are connected to other fields whether common knowldege is small or enormous. Therefore, they can get synergy when studying several subjects. For instance, studying both Physics and Calculus can be beneficial to students for various ways. A lot of contents in Physics are derived using Calculus, and a lot of applications in Calculus are related to Physics. Then the students can feel benefit to the connection between two subjects.
     In addition to synergy, students can be interested in not only their majors but also other fields. It is reasonable that someone who takes several classes studies both his major and liberal arts or culture. When he finds his interest in another field, he would expand his range of information than before; in addition, he might combine one field to another field. For example, a student who takes both chemistry and painting can apply his chemistry knowledge to invent efficient drawing tools.
     Some argue that students who take one class can focus on their majors. Concentrating one class can let them study deeply and save their free time. Nevertheless, students who take a variety of classes can develop themselves further than students who take one class. Although their time is not enough to study deeply, knowledge from several classes can provide synergy and students can study once as if they study the contents repeatedly.
     In conclusion, students who take several classes can provide synergy and expand their knowledge than students who take one class. Naturally, taking one class has some positive aspects. However, students taking one class may not use their potential totally and be limited. Taking several classes can make students bring the opportunity to use their potential more than taking one class. "	4	4.5	4.5	13

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Requiring students to Specialize in One subject in universities is the Best for All
     Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects: other universities require students to specialize in one subject. People are debating about this statement, and this is hot issue now. I insist that universities should require students to specialize in one subject.
     First at all, universities are facilities to teach students in advanced level of the subject. Students learn diverse subjects in course of secondary schools, and they enter to university having purpose to learn specialized subject more deeply. Universities are responsible for this part and they have to give students environment to concentrate in one subject.
    In addition, it is more easy to call better professors when universities require students to specialize in one subject. As universities that require students to specialize in one subject have the obvious vision, superior professors will attracted in this point. Also, as stand out professors are in the these universities, the more eminent professors will come, which will give positive feedback on the universities.
     Some argue that there are some students who are interested in more than one subject, so universities should give them chances to learn about that. However, those are the hobby for students, and universities don't have to make a lecture about these subjects. Students can studty about these subject by searching internet or make a club of studying those subjects and this is not the region that universities should do.
     To sum up, universities should require students to specialize in one subject for students, professors, and for university itself. When universities require students to specialize in one subject, they can satisify the students who want to learn expert information about the subject and attract stand out professors. For these reasons, I insist that universities should require students to specialize in one subject."	4	4.5	4.5	13
960	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Universities Should Require Students to Take Classes in Many Fields
    Unlike high school students, university students choose the subjects and majors they want to study. In many schools, students only study related subjects to their majors and essential subject to fill their graduation credits. But in my opinion, universities should make students take various classes.
    First, the trend these days is to look for people who are distinguished in many fields. Interchanges between different subjects become more active, so the boundaries between them are gradually breaking down. For example, when studying general biology, the TCA cycle is introduced. Many chemical compounds and reactions are in the cycle, so chemical knowledge is mandatory to understand the TCA cycle. Therefore, a wide range of knowledge is essential to study something.
    Second, the chance that finding a subject that suits better or finding new interests can increases when encountering a lot of various subjects. For instance, the professor who recently gave a freshmen seminar lecture had studied only physics when he was young. He studied biochemistry by chance, and he felt a great deal of interest. After that, he studied biochemistry and continued his research, and became a biochemistry professor. Like this case, there are quite a few cases where people are interested in new things.
    However, some think it is better to be an expert in one area because an expert is the most reliable person in the field. Of course, experts are needed and important. But in universities, training experts in one field is also important, but students are too young. Universities should give students various opportunities to explore their aptitude.
    As the boundaries between subjects are broken down due to the development of media, distinguishing in many fields is a great advantage. In addition, encountering various subjects helps students find their aptitude. For these advantages, universities should require students to take classes in many fields."	4.5	4.5	4	13
961	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	" Some universities require students to take several classes in single subjects, in order to specialize students. Other universities requires students to take classes in broad subjects. We can ask question about the effectiveness of the two, and conclude that taking classes broadly in several subjects is better for students. Here are the reasons why.
 
 First of all, there are so many areas that students don't yet know. Leading them to choose from a small spectrum of fields is inappropriate. There is a chance that they might be good at what they don't know. It would be a big loss for students and the nation that students are in. Therefore, tudents should have chance to search what they are good at besides of what they already know.

 Second, if students attend in various subjects, other than their initial interest, they can meet other students with different goals. Getting to know with students with different interest is important. It allows one to think broadly and view the world in different perspective. Students can also share their goals and find possibilities for their carear from what they haven't even think of.  All of these can help choosing one's pathways. This is only possible in college years. After graduating, it is much more harder to search for what one wants to do, which is why this opportunity is even crucial.

 Some say highschool is enough for searching one's carear, but it is not true. In highschool years, the purpose of studying is mainly at getting better grades, in order to attend famous universities. It is more of ""racing"" than ""searching"". Also, what students learned in highschool and what they will learn in college is basically different. Take mathematics for example. In highschool, math is mainly at solving problems; finding one-and-only answer. However, in college, math has nothing to do with solving problems. It is more focused in prooving the mathematical tools that we used noramlly and find patterns in the world of numbers. Students who attend in mathematics major are likely to face a big difference from what they expected. This is not only for math but all the other majors. 


 To conclude, it is hard for one to choose their own carear. "	4	4	4	12

     Some universities teach several subjects because studying many subjects makes 
students think more about their specialized field. But just studying several subjects is not 
always helpful to them. Specializing in one certain subject is better than studying many 
subjects for some reasons: concentrating in a subject, time-saving studying, etc.

     First of all, concentrating in several subjects is much more hard than concentrating in a 
subject. That is why universities teach students in single or two (at max) specialties. In 
medieval days, some talented people studied several subjects, but only few of them were 
able.

     In addition, studying a subject is much more time-saving than studying lots of subjects. 
People have limited time to study, but studying in several specialties might be a greedy 
choice. Even studying a subject takes several years to graduate.

     Lastly, some people might say that studying several subjects helps us to think more 
diversely. The point is that it is about university, not elementary or high schools. When 
applying to universities, the interviewer checks out if a student has skills on specific field.
Object of universities is to foster specialized students, not an amateur studying several 
fields not deeply.

     To sum up, specializing in one subject is better for three reasons; merit of concentration 
of a single subject, time saved by studying a single subject, and the goal of the university. 
The more subjects students study, the less specialties they have grown. In society, people 
who are deeply understanding in a specific field is much more a high-quality human 
source."	4	3.5	4	11.5

First, if I don't do old ones, although my skills of that are reclined quitely, but not removed. When I do that repeatedly, I can reach same level like too. It is very strong reason that I can try new things regardless of other skill level.
Second, I want many experiences. It can be so individual reason. But I want to do other skills and I really try new things by stopping semester sometimes. I'm very excited and happy when I try and study new things like music, drawings.
Last, try new things refresh the old one. If I have some skills that can do very well, it may be related to job with high probablity. Sometimes I have new and wide vision for my advanced skills by leaving for a while.
In conclusion, not only try new things don't affect to old things' skill level, but also can give new vision for it. And individually, I want to make a lot of skills and experiences. So, I like to try new things than do old one. It is not just risk, could be chance."	3	3	3

Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer	"Most of all, people like to do only what they already do well. It is easy to save their time and money. However, I think trying new things and taking risks is better for human life.
First of all, trying new things develop your ability. If you do easy work all day, you can't get additional ability. People can do same work when they know all things of that work, but it is end of develop.  For example, a men who can deliver food have good driving skills cannot be a F1 racer if he do already do well. If he want, he must take a risk.
Second, world is being developed and you have to get new things to be a average worker.  At 1990s, in korea, people can get a job easily. They only need their body and fewer ability. However, at 2020s, you need do more such as english, pre-job experiment and good score in university. If you have same ability that you start that job, you will be fired and company need new worker who more skillful.
Lastly, trying new things can be a moment for better life. People can show better efficiency when they have a goal, and nobody set their goal or dream that already do well. Most people want to have better life. It means they need additional things which they can do like new working skill, good body or professional knowledge.

Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer	"The advantages of trying new thing
I think that it is better to try new things and take risks. This is because people can be more motivated when solving unknown problem and they can get higher sense of accomplishment. 
First of all, people are more interested in new things. The process with certain result is quite boring. Therefor, doing only what they already do might be very boring process since they don’t need any studying or thinking. As a result, people prefer to solve a new problem with taking risks. 
On the top of that, people can feel more happier after they solve the problem with risks, People have many worries before trying a new content such as possibilities and other way to solve. However, they overcome many troubles which prevent solving problem and learn how to try new things and use them in other process. Consequently, they can get much higher sense of accomplishment because they understand the way of trying.
 For example, in my case, I took part in a science contest in our high school with my friends. As I started to prepare the contest, I was panic because I didn’t know anything about what should I do. But I studied hard and shared opinions with teammates and teachers more frequently. During this process, I felt that I desired to get a good score. Even though there were lots of troubles that I need to solve, finally I overcame the problems and got a good result in contest. After the contest, I was very happy so I tried another contest in spite of knowing the difficulty of preparing new contest. 
To sum up, in my opinion, it is better to try new things and take risks."	3	3	3.5

And I had confidence on it. It was nice to be praised for doing what I was good at. Usually, trying new things made me feel scared. I thought about myself as a successful student as I entered KAIST, so I was afraid of failure. It was definite that when I failed, people would sympathize with me. I really didn't want to be sympathized by others. And I didn't want to make others disappointed of me. I just wanted to keep succeeding.
 But now, I prefer to try new things and take risks because I realize that I should improve myself in various ways to get what I want in the future. Trying new things makes me improve variable capacity. And I believe that improving variable capacity will increase probability of success. If I like to do only what I already to do well, I can be an expert on that part. But, unless trying new things and taking risks, I won't solve many complicated problem in society. And also in science, It is definite that there are not simple problems which can be solved by one part, but many complex problems which we should thing of two or more parts to solve. Especially while doing research, I realize that knowledge in various fields is necessary. I was afraid of failures, but now I know that greatest growth is in the process of reflecting on failures and correcting them. It's painful when I fail, but that's when I can grow the most. Even if the experience is not related to my field, It can be applied to other fields, and it becomes a memory in itself. so I think I prefer to try new things and take risks.

Although I am more good at doing something I already do well, but I'm trying my best for doing new things for below reasons. 
First of all, I can learn something while trying new things with risks. While doing the jobs I work well, It must have my own fixed routine or skills for doing the job. It will be same for every trials for the job that I expected. But, for trying new jobs, we have to find new mechanism for solving the problems that I did not expected. 
Next,  It is simply more exciting work to do new things than doing what I already do well. If  I always try only for the tasks that already do well, then we will work same process and get same result. Although it can be a powerful advantages for working something that we already do well as our main job, I think that's the reason that most people feel boring go to their work. 
Finally, I can get more chance what I did not expect while trying new things. For example, While trying new things, we can find our new hobby, or meet other professional people, etc. I think It is similar as going trip to other place. We can see new things that we had never experienced, and we can meet some people far from our daily life. 
For these reason, I prefer to try new things. I also want to say that when we get an experience widely for several ways, and these experiences will eventually improve the abilities for doing what I already do well. So not only just prefer to do new things, also it will improve the skills for the tasks I already do well. "	3	3.5	3.5

Second reason is that, it may be stressful to do something new in some situations. Let's say there is an exam done in a new way which is not familiar form to me. And I have a pressure that I have to get at least A0. However, it is hard to get score in that situation, so I'll get stressed out. Therefore, doing things what I'm used to is less stressful. Final reason is that, it is efficient to do what I'm familiar with. In the company, workers do only things in which they have expertise and leave the things they don't to others who are familiar with those.

  There were lots of choices that I have made until I come now. Most of them were making a decision between 'to do what I did many times so I know that I can do it well' and 'to try a new task which might lead me to fail'. In these situations, I usually take the latter one. The reasons are followings.
  First of all, trying new things improves me. I think that trying new things lets me try to do my best in several ways. It also helps me to learn and study many things. Some people say that there are high risks and uncertainty. But to minimize the risks, I plan what I have to do, consider factors that may cause a failure, and research harder. Thus, even dealing with risk is helpful for my improve.  I think that I cannot go ahead without any challenges. I believe the sentence, 'high risk, high return'.
  Second, it makes me feel alive. While working on new things and struggling to make them possible, I feel alive. To do only what I already do well is easy, but it is not exciting. However, I enjoy uncertainty and expectation of my work. Since I love the process of challenging, I do feel alive regardless of success.
  I believe that what makes me here is the challenge. I went through lots of success and failure, and they contributed to make me stand here. Successive experiences gave me power to go ahead and make a challenge for new things. Failure gave me some thoughts and became an approach in which I would not try later. I'm not afraid of results, I would like to make challenges myself, and try to do my best while feeling alive."	3	3	3

First, there are no any achievement when I do only old things. I'm not best at every part of my life so there are better people than me.

Who try their ways and take risks are moved to next step and the other are stayed same step. So I think that moved to next step and get achievement is very important part of my life so, I prefer to try new things.
Second, we can well communicate by trying new things. There are no people that do some work by exactly same way. So if I don't try new things, I can't understand and communicate with them. So, there are some sentences that '1 time seeing is better than 100 times hearing.' so try new things is best way to find out people's mind.

Others like to do more adventurous experience, so they prefer to try new things and take risks. In my case, I prefer to do what I already do well for 2 reasons.
 First of all, doing something which I already do well can be more comfortable for mental. If we try new things and take risks, only it can be sometimes interesting, but also it can be nervous. Because we don't know what obstacles and difficulties there are and when they appear. And if they come out, it is stressful for solving the problems when we try new things. But if I do what I already do well, I already know what difficulties and problems could come out. Also, I know the solutions approximately and can prepare future. It can be comfortable and peaceful for our mind and metal.
 Second, I can save the time and enhance my skill in the field of things that I already do well. If I try new things, there will be many trials and errors and take a lot of time to reach the state that I can do well. But if we spend time to do things which I already do well, I can do more well in this field and accelerate the improving process, because I know this field and difficulties so I can save the time with enhancing my skills.

Fiirst, I think to do what I already do well is more efficient than to try new things and take risk trying new things is very hard and boring because it have to do very simple things first to try new thing it is so boring things. Next reason is we have to compare to other people to get great results. Most of schools and companies score about peoples ability because it is most efficient way to get greatest result. So we have to compare between me and other people. trying new things are not good to win other people because people who try new things are more slow than people who work that already do well.

There are several way to earn money such as going to company and many people choose safety way. I think the best way to get a big many is different. There are several reasons why I prefer to try new things and take risk, for instance, money, state and for fun.
  First of all, I want to earn a big money. I think I can earn money if I go to big company such as Naver or Google, but it has limit to earn. Moreover, If I getting older, I will go out the company and I can't do anything because I am not ready. To get a big money without limits, I think the best way is trying a new things. There is the famous mention ""High risk, high return"", and I trust it. The easy way to earn money is going to company, but I don't want, so I prefer to try new things and take risks.
  In addition, I want to be the first. There are many famous people who get state and they do a new thing. For example, Edison, He develop the light and give a comfort life to people. People remember the first person and they don't know the second. The first get state, so I want to get state and be remembered the first person who develop a new thing. Many people want to get state and I also, to get a state I will try a new things following the last cases. 
  The last reason is I can learn more about things when I do new things. There are several reasons why people don't do a new things. They image a new things at once, but they don't do that because they think they are failed or they don't have time to challenge. I do many things in middle and high school there all challenge to me and I get more knowledge when I do.

Each preference is pretty reasonable. However, trying new things are much better than doing what you do well in the sides of ability and mind.
  First, trying new things expand your experience and ability. Experience is one of the most important way of learning. In Korea, there is a slang, 'One time of  watching is better than one hundred times of listening'. Like it says, experiencing it directly provides much detailed and correct information than do it indirectly. These expanded experiences will lead to expanding of your ability. You can find your new ability which you have not known, or you can apply your new experiences on your behaviors which you do now. If you do not try new things, you cannot understand what can be better on now because you did not do over your jobs. In shorts, you can experience something directly, therefore you can upgrade not only numbers of what you can do but also what you do now through trying new things.
  Second, it makes your mind more confident. Basically, achieving new things provide you pleasure of success, and it cannot be small or same with pleasure of success of what you usually do. Then, What about case of failure? Most people who do not want to try new things say that risk of failure is the biggest wall on trying new things. However, it can be most attractive points because experiencing failure makes you much stronger. Most famous people in history experience failure a lot. Edison, who invented light bulbs, say, 'I didn't fail one hundred times. I just found one hundred reasons why it's not working.' On doing somethings, there are many ways to achieve it. Some ways can lead to success, but others can lead to failure. Moreover, some people can succeed, but others can fail even if they go through the same way. The important things is success and failure is just difference of only results, so they both have value of ways which you are willing to do. To summarize, trying new things can be your mental trainer regardness of it will lead to succeed or failure.
  Of course, doing you already do well is more comfortable and also important. However, you have to go forward, and you just have lived this way. To do this, trying new things and taking risks are necessary. New experience helps you to find better ways on several situations. Moreover, you can be more confident through succeed and failure by trying new things."	4	4	4

However, avoiding risks will leave you to one of plenty of people who have same performance. To be special, do something special.

Some people agree with that words that taking risks in life is success point. However, the others says that getting rid of risks and taking careful planning is result the success. In my opinion, someone who wants to success in his life should take care of risks or chances for several reasons.
   First of all, human can learn an ability that care for risks by taking it. Experience that take care of risks could make human confidence and talented. In fact, many companies asks in their work interview what their interviewie suffer a risk and how they overcome that. It is obivious that people who suffer the risks produce better results than the other one because they improve their ability with the risks.
   In addition, the development could be done when people face to their risks. Human who alive from ancient circumstance are that face to the risks and overcome them. That fact also makes sense in contemporary life. Many successful people teach their fans and students what they lose and earn from their risky experience. There is no person who do not suffer the risks and success in their life.
   Some argue that the safe life with careful planning is most valuable and successful, and that common and ordinary life with removed a risk do not lose theirs. However, it is just ordinary life than successful life. Safey makes people stop from their situation, so there is no development for those people. 
   To sum up, risks and chances lead people's life success by developing their ability and structures of life. Many cases like ancient humans and successful people could be evidence. Although they can lose all of what they have, the experience of taking the risks makes people more hard and successful one."	4	3.5	3.5

In life, there is various chance which can makes dreams come true or makes a lot of money. I believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances for several reasons.
    First of all, every choices have risks, and risks contain value of choices. There are various chances which can change whole life. These chances require using time, money, and power of human. These demerit is looks like can be a huge problem in life. However, this chance can be a last chance to reach a goal of life. A plan cannot give anything which are not in purpose.
    In addition, taking risk is challenge of life. All plan have difficulties that have to oversee the future and fix choices for best efficiency. When making a plan, future ability cannot be affect correctly. However, future is not fixed; therefore, a plan always changed in life. Plan can not be a solution of life as the result of future diversity. Choosing more valuable choice can deliver more benefits to entire life.
    Lastly, taking risk is more flexible to care problems in life. Someone says, ""A perfect plan consider all huge problems in life, and following this plan is very effective."" However, in life, there is various accidents. Not enough money makes going university difficult, and not enough time makes getting score difficult; a plan that did not think humans ability cannot achieve the goal of life. Choosing best choice at each problem can be a solution.

People want to succeed in life, so they try to do a lot of things. People should choose an option between taking risks or chances and careful planning. Some thinks that taking risks or chances is a better way to success in life, but other think careful planning is a better choice. In my opinion careful planning is more beneficial for several reasons.
First of all, careful planning reduces a possibility of failure. When trying new things, people meet a lot of difficulty such as cost. However, though careful planning people can predict the problems, and they are possible to make solutions to overcome the problems. Thus, when people meet troubles that was predicted, they can solve easily. If people take risks without planning, they are hard to overcome the troubles because they did not know. As a result, careful planning prevents the troubles which bring failure results.
In addition, people can concentrate their works through careful planning. If people do some work without planning, they do not know what they should do. As a result, people can be panic and lose the way to proceed their works. On the other hand, a person who has an obvious purpose via careful planning, they can concentrate focus only. They do not have to consider other variables, so the qualities of their works are improved. These improved results can bring big success.
Lastly, some insists that people should take risks or chances to succeed in life. However, careful planning can induce much bigger success. While planning their works, people can realize various method to use their works. It means that people can get a wide range of insight during planning, so they can use other ways to use success results. People do a lot of effort to apply their results in various area, they can achieve much bigger result compared to taking a risk. 
To sum up, careful planning has more advantages rather than taking risks or chances. Through careful planning, people can decrease the danger of failure and focus on their works. Although it is possible to attain big succeed via taking risks, people can achieve various success results by careful planning. People should realize the importance of planning."	4	4	4

There are many ways to succeed in life: various experience, diligent habit, wide relationships.. etc. The ways can be divided by two representative ways: taking risks or chances and careful planning. Whether success in life comes from taking risks or chances or results from careful planning is controversial. However, success results from careful planning for several reasons.
First of all, various probability can be considered by careful planning. During careful planning, various causes and effects can be considered to analyze the situation. Scope of thought will be wider in this process. Also, it may easier to solve the problem already being considered. 
In addition to various probability, diligent habits can be made by careful planning. By careful planning, wasting time will be disappear. Diligent habits made by careful planning will use time efficiently. It is important to use time efficiently because everyone has the same 24 hours. It will be a powerful weapon to succeed.  
Some argue that an unpredictable failure can make one succeed; however, a failure can be more effective when someone face it after careful planning. If careful planning is already conducted, the failure can be easily analyzed although it is an unpredictable failure. It may not embarrassing for someone who already expect various failures by careful planning. Next plan which reflects failure can be made in short time.

     Every people have a goal of life, and they want to success it. Some people are planning a schedule to achieve their goal. The other people believe chance will eventually come to them and waiting for it, or just taking a risk and  do their best. Although both two schemes are needed to get an  achievement, success eventually results from chance or taking risk for several reasons. 
     First of all, opportunity does not came fairly. It is true that not every people get a chance.; therefore, there is not much people who achieved their goal. Although there will be much more people who are trying their best with hard effort, few people can achieve it by getting a chance. Moreover, some people fail to catch a chance for them.
     In addition, some argue that careful planning can give a success. However, some more things are needed to success. Almost all people can construct plan for their plan. Someone who cannot planning a roadmap, then they can get a help from others. This can also be considered as a chance that met a proper planner for him to achieve it. 
     Finally, taking a risk is essential. The goal is the things that people wants to get in their future, but they are not having now. If there is no risk to achieve the goal, then people can achieve a goal without hard effort. If someone achieve his goal only with carful planning, then planning would be a risk taking job for him. 
     To sum up, successful people achieve their purpose with taking risk or chance. However, opportunity does not came to all people.

Time to get up varies from people to people. Some prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day's work, while others prefer to get up late and work until late at night. In my opinion, waking up early has several benefits.
First of all, waking up early has benefits related to mental health. Waking up early makes people fresh. For example, if they take a walk in the morning breathing fresh air, they might feel fresh. With fresh feeling, they can come up with some creative ideas. Also, according to research, taking a shower in the morning helps creative thinking.
Not only that, getting up results in sleeping early which has benefits related to physical health. Hormones that related to the growth is emitted largely in early night. Therefore, sleep early makes people grow well. In addition, the growth hormone also affects the death and restoring of cells, so sleeping early is affects growth of muscles and skin.
Some people prefer to sleep late and work at night. They choose to work at night because if they have many things to do, they simply do it and sleep later. However, there is no time limit, people tent to concentrate poorly. Because of the illusion that they have infinite time, this approach is inefficient.
To sum up, getting up early has some physical and mental benefits and is efficient. There are plenty of benefits of waking up early, so waking up early is preferable. Therefore, people should get used to wake up early."	4.5	4	4

Some believe that success in life comes from the choice that takes risks or chances, while others believe that careful planning would result in success. In my opinion, careful planning is more important to achieve success for several reasons.
First of all, careful planning is necessary before starting work. The plan is a part of the preparation, so it is preceded to make any decision. Moreover, additional plans that contain alternative methods against unexpected situations would be also helpful. The one who is already prepared can get the chance, so the plan should be always prepared.
In addition, precise planning could reduce the time to reach success. Though the plan is perfect, unexpected situations can occur, then they should be dealt with proper solutions that are already developed. As a result, there would be no wasted time considering new factors, and risks that can happen would be blocked.
Some argue that brilliant discoveries, inventions, and research have been achieved by taking risks; however, they would be based on careful planning. Though they were developed by solving the risks when researchers faced the problems, researchers would have plans for that situation. Careful planning is needed for any moment; for example, during preparation, work, and concluding steps.

Nowadays, success in life can be achieved in two ways. Some claim that success can be achieved from taking risks or chances, while others claim that success results from careful planning. In my opinion, taking risks or chances is the way to success in life.
First of all, prediction does not work these days. No one can predict precisely the world after 10 years or even 2 years. Even if some jobs seem promising, there is no guarantee that they are still symbol of success in the future. Therefore, taking risks or chances and investing talent and money to somewhere people do not think much about will be a better way to success.
In addition to impossibility of prediction, taking risks or chances can result in huge success. Being a pioneer or a leader of some department is easier with taking risks; moreover, taking risks is easier way to follow new trends. Apple bet their future in a smartphone, which is new invention, and became one of the biggest IT companies in the world. Thinking differently and getting ready to discard the trial when it does not seem to be road of success will help people to find a way to a huge success.
Some argue that planning can help people what to do exactly; however, that can make people caught by plan. Sometimes, the plan can be written by overestimation. For example, some decided to start drawing and then make 12 artworks per year, but they can be impatient if working speed is not fast enough. It is not only harmful for health but also the quality of the works. If people just trying new method of drawing, they are more likely to success.
To sum up, taking risks or chances is a qualification of success in life. Because the prediction has low precision, it is better to take risks and invest in new part that no one has considered. Not fearing the failure is the key word for the success nowadays."	4.5	4.5	4.5

First, you are not able to achieve bigger success you really wanted if you do not take risks. Second, if I success after trying new and risky things, it makes me happier than just doing the things I do well already. Finally, you can get some important lesson by failing that will help through whole life.
 You can achieve bigger success through doing new challenging works. When something is risky, it means it will give you high return for the usual cases. So it makes us to get more things that we wanted. Also, if you try new things and achieve some success in the field, you will be able to mix two things you can do well. Then you may be better at the thing you already do well by trying new things and it may leads to a bigger success.
 Second, you can feel better feelings if you get a success on new things. Just doing the things that you are already good at and achieve some good result may give you good feelings. However, it can't be better than the feelings you get from new things. When you try some new challenging works, then you will feel nervous. So, if you get good results though you are feeling nervous, then you can feel the additional hapiness that you achieve good results though you are doing new feeling nervous.
 Finally, we can get good lesson by your failure. Though you fail for new things, it's not just failure. Failure will give you good lesson to go through when you challenge again for the new things.

So, if you learn something from the failure, you may be better and you can try the thing again. Then you may get success, and it will be more precious success for your life.
 In conclusion, you can get bigger success by doing new things. Then you may feel happier than just doing the thing you can do well already. You may not fear whether you may fail or not. You can get great lesson from the failure and be better than before. Therefore, I prefer to do new and risky things."	3	3	3

When people works in their specific area, efficiency improves and be able to complete works better. I will introduce my experience about it.
  I joined in film making club in 2017. We had 20-30 minutes filming activity at every vacations. Due to club member's schedule issue, we had only 3 weeks for making full film. It was quite hard work to make 30 minutes film only for 3 weeks. To do this work, we separate club members into various group. some group was specialized in acting. other group paid attention for writing script. the other group worked for shooting and another group was editing our film. By this separate working with their ability, we completed our film in time. If we try what we are not doing well, complete film might be impossible or it must be the low-quality. 
  Taking risks is important when you learn something, or recommended if you prepared for any risks. Creativity cannot occurs without taking risks. However, specialized work can only provide satisfied result in limited time."	2.5	2.5	3

However, I prefer to try to new things and take risks. There are several reasons. 
  First, I'm happy to try to new things which other people are hard to start. When I was young, I enjoyed to learn foreign languages. It was a difficult, because I did not know Korean well. However, I really enjoyed that process. 
  Second, I'm too young. Because I'm just 25 years old, I have much time to try it again. Therefore, I need to be more brave and try new things.
  Finally, high risk can bring us high return. It is hard to make new things when that industry is developed already. However, if I make new semiconductor structure, I will get a lot of money. I think that it is enough reward for high-risk challenge. "	2.5	2.5	3

Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer	"I prefer doing only what I already do well to trying new things and taking risks. Because if I did not succeed in doing new things, then my proud would became lower and lower. For people, an proud is very important in order to live their life, since it makes their performance of everything they do better. If they lose it, then they may do not well on their work. For example, let's suppose I took a course and I got A0. Then next semester, I took a challenging course and I got B0. Then I would lose proud, so in the next semester, I would not do well as I did in the first semester.

Nowadays, many people do bitcoin in order to earn money. They always have to take risks. Nevertheless, Most of them lose their money. This shows that challenging is like an casino game, which only depends on their luck. If they study bitcoin a lot, then they may be do well respectively, but it still depends on their luck. If they only depend their luck when they do bitcoin, they may lose a lot of money, or even lose all of their money, or have to get a help of loan. Challenging is very dangerous, in this point of view.

Also, people naturally prefer stablity to challenging, according to many research results. It is their natural property. When we choose our job, we tend to choose what we can do well instead of what we like to do. It's because what we can do well makes stable money to live our life. Passion is also important, but only passion without ability makes people poor in majority of cases. Thus, we can figure out that most people think that stablity is the most important value in their life.

For instance, for who likes science and math, doctor is very excellent job, in comparison to researcher or scientist. Do you think that it is because all of them like doctor's job? The answer is definitely No. They may really like do experiment, and do research. However, doctor earns a lot of money and it makes their life stable. This shows most people prefer stablity very much. Similarly, public work employee is one of the very popular jobs in Korea past 25 years.

For the reasons I stated above, we can realize that doing only what we already do well is way better than trying new things and taking risks."	3	2.5	3

Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer	"All of people like to do only what they already do well. This is proper method because reduction of risk and we just want safety way. I also following this method, but I prefer to try new things and take risks. Here are some reason why.
First, No risks, no returns; If we do something already do well is doing just what i know. Thus, we cannot upgrade our experiment skills. For instance, Car driving. Suppose that you get driver's license yesterday. If you do not practice driving, you can't drive your car. but try practicing with risk, you can get more better driving skills.
Second, We can achieve self-propelled person. While living on this world, we must have interact a lot of unexpected situation. When we crush on this with self-propelled skills, can solve problem easily and wisely. By the way, which person only do they already do well will meet various problems.
Finally, You cannot grow variable way. Just stay on your step. For example, there is two people which one is willing to go Bungee Jump, and other one is afraid of jumping. Also those people is the first time of Bungee Jumping. The first one can get some physical sense and ability while other one just stay on his step.
Trying new things can make you to more dynamic and outgoing person. Do not hesitate, just do it. But if you think 'safe' Firstly, you can just on your step. Make your choice."	4	3.5	3.5

Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer	"Recently, some people like to try new things and take risks. But, I prefer to do only what I already do well. There are two reasons to support my opinion. 
First, we can get more confidence while doing what we already do well. If we do something already well, we don't afraid to do that. It can makes we get better result. For example, In 2021 fall semester, I took the course that I already know well. Because of participating individual study, I knew many parts of that course. I got confidence while doing homework and taking exam. So, I got good grade.
Second, we don't feeling stress to do what we already do well. When we try new things, we can get more stress because we don't know about it. In that case, we should consider so many things and we worried about the result. For example, my friend try to change his research subject. But, he don't have expertise for new subject. So, he get stress and always worried whether he can do well on that subject.
Doing only what we already know well can make us get confidence. Also, It can make us feel less stress. For these reasons, I like to do only what I already do well."	2.5	2.5	2.5	
1001	Lifestyle: Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer	"There are diverse people who can do something well. Someone is good at doing exercise and other is good at studying. Doing what they alread do well is more helpful for other people. I think people have their own roles in our society so I prefer to do what I can do well. There are  reasons why I think like this.
  First, doing what I do well is safer than doing new things. Many people have died by some unpredictable accidents when they try to do new things. That is because people cannot prepare enough when they face new situations. For example, there is someone who are going to travel where is not popular. This place has not enough information so this person can't keep himself from something dangerous such as lost, poison foods, and strangers. If he goes to where is popular or he is used to go there, the probability of situation he can be faced will be smaller.
  Second, it makes me more active to do what I do well. I have a new experience to play soccer with my new friends. I had some fear to mistake in my position and this will make losing score so I couldn't play soccer freely and the result is our team's lose. However, with my best friends, I could do my best like dribble and shooting with proud and this made our team's win. With familiar situation, I can do something more active and the result of this is positive.
  Third, it is more efficient to do what I can do. When I do something new, many resources to prepare are needed such as time and money. I have to find many information to do new things and it is hard to find even though I invest much time and money. However, when I do familiar things, it takes short time to prepare to do this. This makes me more time to do something others.
  These are the reason why I prefer to do what I already do well. Trying to do something new has some risks, makes me passive to do, and is not efiicient. I am going to do something familiar until I overcome these causes. "	3.5	3.5	4

Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer	"Some people tend to do what they are friendly and already do well. However, I prefer to do something new due to some reasons.
 At first, I can learn something from doing it. If I do what I already know well, I can not get something new and better than usual. However, although there are some risks, I can get some knowledge and experience, and I may find better results than usual. For example, if I go to a restaurant that I already have visited several times, I could eat a delicious dinner as usual. However, if I go to a new restaurant that I have not visited yet, there are some risks, but I may have a greater dinner than usual. Even if that is worse than other restaurants, now I can know how this restaurant is. 
 Also, doing what I already know is not fun. Doing only what I am friendly with means repeating same everyday life. It must be boring because it is similar to watching the same movie and drama multiple times. Some people may say that ""repeating the same life is better than facing a difficult situation which is made by taking risks."". However, taking some risks is a part of my fun, because a story without any risks and obstacles is not interesting.
 Lastly, trying something new could be a chance to prepare for some unexpected situations. People who like to do new things may have various experiences. These people may solve problems more easily than people who are on the opposite side. Let's think about the situation of finding a good restaurant when you travel to other countries. If you have tried many things, you might eat that country's food, and you can easily choose what you want to eat. However, If you are not that kind of person, you will have difficulty with what you will eat.
 I think trying new things is better because of these three reasons. Taking risks may lead you to be in a difficult situation or have worse results. However, if you think in a different way, It is not a bad one because there must be something we can learn through resolving that problem. Now, why don't you try something new?"	3.5	3	3

 ""Life is choices between birth and death"". Like this sentence, there are many situations that require me to choose something. For instance, I had to choose university, major, and even the lectures that I took every semester. In this situation, some people always choose what they are familiar with. However, I prefer to try new things than do only what I already do well for three reasons.
 First, I feel happy when I do something new. Doing what I never have experienced is excited for me. Moreover, I can find something that I have talent through trying new things.
 In addition, if I fail something when I try it, it is okay also. To know what I don't do well is as important as to know what I do well. Knowing both can make me choose better in the future. For example, think about a programmer who took the marketing course and a programmer who didn't. The former may choose well when they decide their jobs.
 Finally, trying things can be an opportunity that I become better. In the childhood, life is series of try new things such as walking, reading, writing, etc. People can develop as going through this process. Although I won't do exactly same things, the skills I got from the things will be helpful for my life.
 For these reasons, I prefer to try new things. I don't know what I will do in the future. Therefore, I have to prepare many things. Moreover, new things mostly make me excited even though it is not comfortable. "	3	3	2.5

Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer	"From past, I prefer to do something that I can do well. I like to do computer game that I am accustomed at rather than not. And I like repetitive day rather than extreme day. Let me explain why I have this mind.
    First of all, I dislike taking risks. Of course, someone likes to try new things. I think this is because they are happy when they get corresponding compensations such as money or position. But, I usually think and consider risk that I get when I have a failure rather than compensations that I get when I have  a success. In other words, as I try new things, I am always worried about a situation when I have failure. And this makes me dislike new challenges.
    Second, I think I like experimental things. When I was an high school student, I was a smart student. This was because I could solve problems that I had seen before very well. So, before midterm exam or final exam, I tried to see and memorize contents as possible as I can. As a result, I could get good score on Korean, English, history. But, I could not get good score on mathmatics. This is because there were always new trend problems on exams.
    After I came to KAIST, I got low score on many subjects because of this reason. So, I had very low self-confidence. However, when I listened to the circuit class, my life was exactly changed. I felt circuit is very fun. I wanted to experiment circuits. I think this is because circuit is experimental area. Although scholars who are in circuit area need to try new things, their knowledge that they got is very important. I like this.
    From these reasons, I think I prefer to do already well rather than try new things. However, to try new things is very important to scholars. They always find and explore areas that anyone never know. So, I hate trying new things now, but I should do my best on trying new things."	3.5	3	3.5

Because that life will be much safer than trying new things. But, I think only by trying new things, we can have more valuable life. I will introduce two reasons why I prefer the life trying new things.
 First of all, by trying new things, I can experience a lot of new things. If I do only what I do well, my everyday life would be same for all days. Then, it would be so hard to experience new things and I can't learn anything from that life. But, by trying new things, I can have various experiences and that will give me a lot of lessons. By those experiences and lessons, I can be a better person.
 The second reason I prefer to try new things is because it will make my life much funnier. For example, imagine a person who is really good at studying and do study all days. Do you think that life is fun? I think that life is really really boring. But, otherwise, if a person tries to do many other things such as sports, singing, dancing and so on, he could make many friends and experience many different things. So, his life will be much funnier than the studying only life."	3	3	3.5

Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer	"Some people usually do only what they already do well. They said they feel happy and fun when they realized themselves that they are good at something. And I also agree to their opinion. My major is mathematics. When I realized myself that I'm pretty good at math, I felt math is much more interesting than before. However, I don't afraid to try new thing even if it expected to difficult for me. To do something what I already do well is funny and it makes my self-esteem higher. But try new thing and learn it also makes me feel that I'm keep developing myself more and more. Because learning something new is interesting and fruitful. And also when imagine the future that I become a good at that thing, then I feel happy. 

For example, I'm learning piano now. When I was a child, my parents give me a classic music CD. And I like it. Especially, I like a piano music more than other musics. So I want to learn the piano and play the music that I liked. So I start to learn the piano. But I'm seriously bad to fit the right tempo.  Some part I play much slowly and some part I play faster than original tempo. Thus, My piano level increase very very slowly. Since I was a child and at that time, I'm not patient, I quit the piano. And I grown up and became a college student. But still I like the piano music and in my mind, I still want to learn piano again and play the music what I want to play. So I try once again. Last January, I start to learn piano again. In this time, I practice hard. To fix my bad tempo sense, I use metronum and try to play to fit the tempo. Also I heard carefully to piano teacher's advice. Still my piano level increase slowly, but I can feel that my piano level was definitely increasing. Then, I feel fun to play the piano. So I bought a electronic piano to practice much more. I practice the piano in my dormitory room with headset. And now, I can play some musics that I want to play in my child hood pretty well. And I play such musics to my family. I feel very happy that I achieved what I want to do.

To play a beautiful music, I put my times and suppress my mine that don't want to practice more. And finally, I overcame myself and it gives a great self satisfactory. So try some new things to take a risks is not that bad idea. Actually, I think it has a worth to do such things at least once in the life. It will be a good experience and also makes your self-esteem higher. Not only the piano, I tried to learn boxing. I'm not good at sports and boxing makes me exhausting cause of it's high activities, but it's funny. So, I'll keep try and challenge new things that I want to achieve even if I'm not good at such things and it take risks"	2.5	2.5	2.5

Because of 4th industry revolution, the world has rapidly improved all of ideology such as Politics, Economy, Culture, Social and Science etc. What I mean is that many people are required to have more expert knowledge on their jobs. To follow change of world, they have tried to get more sensitivity about new knowledge & technology. So, they are busy now.
Unfortunately, they will be burn-out unless they find appropriate solutions on their tasks. Appropriate solutions is not innovative answers. Based on their prior activity, many people can find solutions that they easily find. On the other hands, to try new things and take risks requires more busy and more complicated activity to people. “If you do this way, you maybe burn-out.” This phase is usual talk from our parents or our seniors.

But, I think that doing our best is more exciting and appropriate stance on our complicated world. As I mentioned before, to try new things should spend much time than the other. That point is the most concern by many people in terms of ‘time consuming’. But, you should not hear your parents & seniors if you want to do that.

Professor Park who is on Stanford university. she worked mathematical teacher for seven years. But, she didn’t give up her dream that she want to find new discovery on math. So, she exit her job, and then she became the professor on Stanford, and she could find new discrete math theory at that time.

However, I also think it is good to try new things but it takes lots of effort. Therefore, I like to do what I already do well. There are two specific reasons. 
 First of all, it takes less risk. Compared with trying new things, doing something I already do well is much safer which means less time, less effort. So, I think there is no need for me to try new things if there are two options. It's like choosing a rough road instead of a paved road.  For instance, there was a homework to write an essay about coffee. I chose a common one and my friend chose a unique one that hardly anyone has ever heard of. When I searched the internet to get some information, there were a lot of information because it's common. Therefore, I could finish my searching activity within two hours. However, when my friend searched the keyword on portal, nothing came out, so she had to borrow some books from the library and it took more than 5 hours.  This clearly shows that trying new things needs much time and effort than doing only what I already do well. 
 Secondly, doing well means a lot. Every person wants to be recognized, and I think the best way to be recognized is doing well. Doing something that I have never experienced can be very encouraging, but no one can be sure of the results. Here is an example, my cousin worked at a big company for 15 years and he was talented at that job. Everyone in his company admitted that he is very productive which allowed him to get high salary even if he was 30s. One day, he told his parents that he wants to open a bakery that he has dreamed of. Unfortunately, he was not good at cooking which includes baking. However, he opened a bakery named after him, but the result was not good. His bread was not attractive enough for people to buy regularly because it was so common and not unique. As a result, he closed the bakery after 2 years and went back to his workplace. I admit that trying new things and be challenged is brave and nice. But I am curious about whether taking risk is good or not. 
 As you can see from these reasons above, I think people should take less risk and do something that they are good at. Therefore, I prefer to do only what I already do well."	2.5	3	2.5

Firstly, my Air Force life proves it. when I served as an air man, it was very hard to adept military life. So it has taken so much time to be friendly with whole new environment. After I synced with it, however, it was very comfortable to me.
In addition, my developer career is another key to prove it. Simply, there are two categories for web developers: front-end developer, back-end developer. The former needs technical stacks which are very easy to be modified and have unexpected changes. However, the latter have to know more about history and legacy. Since of my preferences, I'm doing with back-end jobs now.

     Everyday life is changing. Today is different with yesterday, and tomorrow will be different with today. In this wave of changes, some people say that if some try nothing, then they will not lose anything; however, in my opinion, taking risks or chances has several benefits for success in life.
     First of all, success can be achieved only through exploring new fields. For example, only birds which get up early in the morning can eat warm. Humans are same. Only people who try the first can get some kind of success. Even if some may fail at the first time, if they actually took some risks or chances at the first, they can try again. 
     In addition to pioneership, people can learn in fail as well as success. Fail can say that why something was not working or was not helpful. If some try nothing and just plan, for example, then they will not be able to know the things. Experiences are the best teachers in lives.
     Some argue that careful planning is needed to achieve success; however, in my opinion, taking risks or chances is essencial for success because people cannot predict everything in future. There is not much time to predict the future and make lists of all possibilities. Just doing leads people to success.
     To sum up, taking risks or chances is essencial for success in life. Success can be only acieved with pioneership and fail can be good teacher. Without taking risks or chances, people will never fail, but they will also never succeed. Just do it."	4	4	4.5

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Taking Risks in Life and Challenging for Chances is Needed for Success
     There has been a lot of debates about what is a easy way to success in a life. Some people argue that without deep and careful thought about which way people should go, people are not able to success. Others argue that people have to have a mind to challege for a risky things which will give people great return. People who prefer risky things say that we can not know what will happen in life, so people need to take risks to get great success. In my opinion, people have to take risks and have to challenge for a several reason.
     First, human can not predict their future precisely. The future is very unpredictable thing; therefore, the things that look very safe can become risky things in the future, and the things that look unsafe can become not risky things in the future. It means that doing the things people think that is needed for their life is the right way to success. Future is changing so fast, so thinking about risk of what they are doing is useless because they can not predict fast changing future. Nowadays, technology develops so fast, and it will make future unpredictable more than the past, which means people need to take risks to success. 
     In addition, failure from taking risks can make people achieve better results. If people keep challenge for risky things, they may fail from the challenge. However, all failure has thing to learn. Lots of experiences will be the good data for the people who challenge again for the risky things, and it makes people to plan better when taking risks. Challenge which is well-planned will be much safer than before, then this challenge become safe thing that will give you better result than not taking risks.
     Some people may argue that people can predict future by careful planning, and it will give people to get safer success. However, nowadays people see lots of unpredictable development of human being. For example, AI field is not that popular field for researchers for more than 20 years, yet they become the most popular field in less than 5 years. All the people who success in their life take risks when you see the history. People in the historical books that fight for the king always take risk and the people who take risk get a great success.
     In conclusion, people who challenge for risky things and search for a good chance will success. People can not know how the future will be changed, so risky things may not be risky. Failure will give people good knowledge about how to success much better. Some may say that careful planning will let you predict the future; however, nowadays are changing so fast and history says challenging people success more. More challenging will let people get more success. "	4	4	3.5

Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. In my opinion, live life at a slower pace is better for several reasons. 
First of all, take time and slow pace live improve work efficiency. If people in a hurry, they can make mistakes and errors in their results. Slow pace gives them a mental composure, so they make less mistakes during their work. Also, creativity comes from life at a slower pace. According to the Science, a famous science magazine, brain is activated when they got rest and took a deep breathe. 
In addition, slower pace people are easy to go further. When they receive some jobs, people in a hurry start their jobs right away. People at a slower pace usually make plans for jobs. Plans give a right direction to go, and accelerate the speed of processes. Slow, but steady: this is the important value for long-term results.
Others argue that people who are in a hurry and get things done can make more success and improvement. However, since people is not robots, they cannot run forever. Sometimes they would tired and burned out. People in a hurry might get stress and it causes bad for their mental and physical health. 
To sum up, It seems that people in a hurry can do more jobs and make better results; however, it is not a true. Take a rest and start with plan making is always better than just start without planning. If it requires some creativity, needless to say, take some time is important."	4	4	3.5

     In addition to different pace to concentrate, slower pace gives time to check for mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes because we are human being; moreover, if people do things at a fast pace, more mistakes occur. These mistakes can be corrected at slower pace. There is enough time to check for mistakes, and people have enough time to figure out how to make mistakes.
     Some people argues that if people do quickly, people can do more; However, if people care about the speed, the quality of work can be reduced. Doing things at a fast pace is advantageous for speed, but disadvantageous for quality. Especially, in areas where quality is important, such as semiconductors, a slower pace to focus on quality is preferred. 
     To sum up, Doing things at a slower pace make a better results than doing things at a fast pace. People have a different pace to concentrate, and a slower pace gives them time to check for mistakes. Also, the quality of work increases through a slower pace. Instead of focusing on fast pace, people need to work at the slower pace to make good results."	4	4	4

People wants to live a successful life. However, many people do not know how to succeed and some of them keep working without making a plan about their future. Nevertheless, it is right to see that success in life comes from careful planning. The specific reasons are provided below.
First of all, planning the future is the key of success. In other words, one should work hard after getting acquianted about rules of the games enough. If one does not plan the future and just keep hard working, the probability of success definitely would be lowered. A concrete plan about the future makes one succeed stably and naturally.
Moreover, according to some research, majority of people prefer stability to challenge. Suppose the game flipping a coin exists. One earn 1000 dollars if a front side of the coin faced up, and one lose 1000 dollars if a back side faced up. Then 90 percentiles of people do not participate this game according to the experiment. This shows that preferring stability is a human nature. A person is more likely to succeed if they follow human nature, not counteract it.
In addition, failure that happen by doing challenge is not reversible. It makes one's life more frustratingly. Everyone should be responsible for managing one's life on one's own. Suppose one, a very poor person, lose one's money a lot while investing in stocks or bitcoin. Although one's intention was earing money, economic loss that happen once would be not reversible. It is important thinking not only the cases of success, but also the cases of failure.
One can argue that a person such as Steve Jobs succeed by doing challenges and taking a risks. However, this case is rare respectly. The number of people who succeed by doing careful planning is much more than the number of people who succeed by doing challenges. In other words, the majority of succeed people always made concrete planning about their future.
One can also argue that one of impartant value of KAIST is challenges. However, challenge is only effective if planning is well equipped. In other words, challenge without planning is no use and very dangerous, which might lead to one's life serious failure.
To sum up, planning the future is the key of success. Moreover, one is more likely to succeed if one follow human nature, the preference of stability. In addition, failure that happen by doing challenge is not reversible. Thus, one can conclude that success in life comes from careful and contrete planning."	4	4	4

    People wants to success in life due to money and honor. Some people think that taking risks or chance will change their lives and other think that careful planning will change their lives. In my opinion, taking risks and some chances can help success life for several reasons.
    First of all, no risk can get only no return. For example, students who study hard to go to university cannot play more with their friends due to studying and academy homework; But, another one just hang out with their friends. On first case, they did to take a risk, so finally they graduate university and take a first step to success. Later one take no risk and missed their chances.
    Some believe that careful planning can only change their lives. However, although they perfectly ready for full planning, plan is just a one sheet of paper. For example, driver cannot drive the sketched car on sheet of paper. Someone need to make that sketched car for real. So, they have to process their plan on reality; In that process, they need to take a risk and wait for nice chance. 
    To sum up, taking risks and chances are hide in the back side of all successful things. Also, just planning cannot be done anything; however, they should process their plan. In that process, they will exactly crush on taking risk and waiting for chance. Taking risks and chances can change someone lives."	3.5	3.5	3.5

There is a controversial topic about how to success. Some say success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others think that success results from careful planning. In my opinion, careful planning is more appropriate to success in life.
     First of all, careful planning is effective. Planing is proper way to know current circumstance exactly. Many can think about what should do now, and can consider step by step process to improve themselves. They find information about their fields while planning. It could be very helpful to their success.
     In addition to effective way, planning is more safe way.  During planning, many think about various situations. This is helpful for when they meet unexpected situation. Because they consider lots of circumstance, they can solve the problem well.
     Some argue that taking risks can get big advantage. However, that is very rare case in reality. If they take risks and not plan about future, it should make disappointed results. Many says that appropriate planning is needed to get expected results.
     To sum up, careful planning is proper to success. It is more effective than taking risks or chances, and it is safe way to success. Some think that taking risk is chance to get big advantage, but it is just very small number of cases. If many do careful planning well, they can get expected results in future."	4	4	4

     A number of people want to get success in their lives. To achieve success in life, they have different perspectives. Some say that success comes from taking risks or chances, but others say success result comes from careful planning. In my opinion, taking risks can make success for several reasons.
     First of all, behaviors which take risks let people do various experiences. Anyone do not know where success comes from. Therefore, experiences on various fields increase probability of getting success; for example, favorite Youtube creators do a lot of tries for their contents. In these diverse tries, some contents become famous in people, and it gives them much money. A number of experiences make them successful.
     In addtion to getting various experiences, taking risks makes people's mind more challenged. A lot of people give up their tasks due to a fear of fail. However, most of successful people consider taking risks as an essential mind to get success because it makes people to overcome fear to challenge. Reducing fears comes from taking risks.
     Some argues that the thoroughly prepared plan to exaggerate risks gives success to people. They say that there is no success without planning. However, fail appears in anywhere unpredictly, so if a plan did not give them successful results, those who prepare plan hard feel very disappointed. This feeling makes them not to be able to retry. Thus, to get success, it becomes natural to take risks to try repeatedly.
     To sum up, success are brought by taking risks because of these reasons. Taking risks can provide people to diverse experiences, challenging mind. Risks which is taken for tyring is not just risks. These are investment in people's success."	4	4	4

    Nowadays, many people try to get success, and most of them fail. There are a lot of risks on the way to get success, and some people say that removing risks is the most important thing. However, to succeed, taking risks is unavoidable and there are several reasons. 
    First of all, removing every risk is impossible. There are too many risks, and we can not know all of them; also, some risks are impossible to prevent even if people already know about them. People should take some risks even if they make very careful plans. It is impossible to avoid taking risks, so raising an ability to overcome the risks is better.
    Additionally, people who prevent risks can not get big success. To succeed, they should reach some states faster than other competitors. However, preventing risks needs time, and this leads the speed of development to be lowered. Professor Dae Jeon who was the CEO of SASUNG said that taking risks is not avoidable for people who want success because other people try to do something new while some people check risks in their plan (Jeon 57). 
    Some people argue that taking risks is too dangerous because it will be a disaster if at least one risk becomes a big unexpected problem in the future. However, risks exist because success is made from new attempts. If someone has a plan with no risk, it should be a plan without something new.  People who do not try something new attempt never succeed forever.
  To sum up, there is no way to get success with preventing risks perfectly. People who prevent success as much as possible are hard to get success, even if it is a safe way. Also, even if it is a dangerous and difficult way, taking risks and chances will give people success.

   All people want to success in their lives. Therefore, they try to find the way to be successful. Some people think taking risks or chances makes success in life. Others believe that planning results in success. In my opinion, success in life results from careful planning for several reasons.
   First of all, people can make no mistakes using plan in their jobs. They do not miss anything because all information is in their plan. Their supervisors and colleagues evaluate them as professional. Moreover, there are some jobs that do not allow any mistakes; for example, programmers have to write all required lines of code because the one error makes the whole model cannot function. Finding the error takes more time than writing whole thing again. Therefore, the perfect results in the first time is important to make success.
   In addition to not making mistakes, people can think deeply during planning. They have enough time to think about themselves, their jobs and their future. They can find what they are good at, what they want, and what they have to do in the next step. If people do not know about themselves, they would work in the area that they are not good at. People who know about themselves well would be the ones whom others want to work with, to employ, and to invest.
   Some argue that planning is useless if the situation changes. However, people cannot get opportunities without planning. When people who have no plan face rapidly changing situation around them, they would get panic and give up everything. On the other hand, people who have plan can react to the situation since careful planning includes predicted changes and the reaction they have to take now. If there is no exactly same situation in the plan, they can find another way from the plan and adjust it to the situation.
   To sum up, people have to make plan in order to find success in their lives. Careful planning helps people to make them professional, make them know about themselves, and make them be able to react to changing situation. If people start to make their own plan and extend it, it may be the most precious things in their lives."	4.5	4.5	4

    Today, People make effort to success in their life because they want to earn money or get honor from others. Although most of them want to be successful one, the method to success that they argue are different. Some believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In my opinion, I think success is related to careful planning.
    First of all, from the view of money, careful planning to manage money is the most important method. Assume that someone has 1,000$. He spends all money for stock, for he thinks stock will rise up to 2,000$. However, in reality, there is a probability that stock will go down to 500$; furthermore, stock will go down to 100$. Therefore, people have to consider and determine how much money they invest. There is one popular investing method. That is quantum investing. People think about interest rate and invest each options such as stock, fund, and gold; therefore, their loss will be minimum. 
    In addition to the view of money, careful planning is helpful to their careers. People get their majors from college and some certifications from going to test. If they go to major that does not have successful future, their careers will be fail; In addition, if they prepare some tests that have very low probability to pass, they have a probability that they cannot pass that test until 30 ages. Therefore, without careful planning, they will fail to their careers. If they plan their future and prepare something that they need, they can be successful ones. 
    Some argue that taking risks or chances is only method to success in modern society. However, they should consider that taking risks or chances has danger to fail. If careful planning fails, it is okay because people have chance to plan or prepare other plan; However, if taking risks and chances fails, it is dangerous because people have no chance to take other risks or chances. There are many variables in modern society, so people cannot know they success or fail; therefore, they have to consider what is dangerous for their life and what is helpful for them.
    To sum up, in order to success in life, careful planning is important. From the view of money, investing with planning has great chance to earn more money, and from the view of carrer, preparing something with considering has high probability to success in their career. Predicting something is boring and hard task, so people have tendency to do something without considering; however, once they have plan, they can think about what is failure factor. Also, if people always have careful planning, they can be successful one in their life."	4.5	4.5	4

When people graduate high school and become young adults, they go through lots of psychological changes. They want to get out of the shadows of their parents and try to do things by themselves. Some people say that family is the most important influence on young adults; however, others say that friends are the most important influence. In my opinion, in the age of young adults, friends have the greatest influence on them for several reasons.
     First of all,  young adults spend most of their study time with friends. After graduating high school, most of the students enter universities. Therefore, although they graduated high school, they still have to spend a lot of time studying. They study in classrooms, libraries, and dormitories, so they are always with their friends. By spending lots of time together, they naturally have a lot of influence on each other.
 In addition to studying, young adults give and take advice from their friends. Generally, friends have similar age with them; therefore, they have similar worries. By talking and sharing their thoughts with friends, young adults can find answers of their worries. For example, most of male young adults in Korea have worries about military. Some of them go to military at the age of 20 and others go to military at the age about 30. Sharing their experiences and thoughts about military can make them have better choice.
 Lastly, young adults enjoy leisure with friends a lot. Some say, as young adults, people should spend lots of time with their parents and siblings. They think spending time with family is most valuable; however, nowadays, most of young adults enjoy leisure time with friends. Since, friends have similar mindsets and similar physical abilities, it is more fun to play with friends. Accordingly, friends give more entertaining leisure time for them.
 To sum up, friends have the most important influence on young adults. They study with friends, give and take advice with friends, and enjoy leisure time with friends. When becoming young adults, they really want to try and experience something new. Therefore, friends, who have similar values and thoughts, can be the best companion. When becoming young adults, they should spend as much time as possible with their frie"	4.5	4	4.5

Everyone want to success in their life. Success in life implies comfortable and stable in the rest of life. Many people do not want to taking risks, so hesitate to challenge something unclear.  To avoid taking risks, many people want to success in their life. Because once he or she success in economically or politically or whatever, he or she has less burden to challenge a new thing and can do he or she wants. However, ironically; to success in life, sometimes taking risks is unavoidable with several reasons.


First of all, no one can predict his or her life and perfectly plan the life. Sometimes it can be possible to face unexpected dangers or risks. If feel fear to not predicted risks and not try to taking it, cannot be develop. Only try to overcome risks and taking the burden can improve and bring to next level. For example,  a rocket scientists. Shooting a rocket and placing it on the right orbit is not only difficult but also has various risks. However, they did not give up and kept challenging, and finally success to shoot the rocket. 

In addition, challenge more difficult thing can brings great improvement even if it fails. Only do a thing that already do well cannot gives an improvement. During challenge a hard thing and overcome it, new ideas will come up and the ability will improved.  For example, steven smail, a mathematian. When he was a student, he's grade is very bad. However, he try to solve an extremely difficult conjecture, so called Poincare's conjecture, and finally solve it in infinitely many dimensions. After this, he won Fields prize and still now, he do great research in mathematics.

Some argue that success follows from careful planning. Of course planning future and prepare possible risks is important. However, sometimes must take unexpected risks and challenge some thing that it look cannot achieve. Life is so unpredictable, thus sometimes the future plan would be fail and sometimes the whole plan became meaningless. Therefore, try to taking risks and challenge new thing is unavoidable.

To sum up, life is unpredictable. Sometimes we must overcome the unexpected risks. Moreover, challenge a difficult thing brings great improvement to a person's ability and gives fruitful new ideas. Opponents argue success can follows from careful planning. However, the careful plan can be fail, then eventually at some point, must taking risks and challenge to overcome the difficulties. Do not afraid to taking a risk and challenge new things, and success will follows."	4	3.5	3.5

When anyone was a child under 20 years old, he could be helped from his family and friends to grow well. However, if he was over 20 years old, he could feel many things on their surroundings. At that time, everyone related with him want success life of him. Among them, his friends can give the most important influence on young adults such as him.    

First of all, friends' age is close to young adults' age. The fact that a young adult and someone has same age or similar age is helpful for young adult's life; therefore, they could be friends. Friends can help him to do anything with regard to projects, marries, and the other things. The crucial point is that they will be old together until final of world, so they can help anything to each other until that.    

In addiction to the closing ages between them, friends are funny and enjoyable. It means that, anyone can feel happy by their friends' behaviors. If someone's friend is very stupid and like to do risky activities, someone have yet to disconnect the relationship with friends; he maybe like all of things of his friends. So, friends can be 'engine' to help his life.         

Lastly, friends sometimes are kind and humble. Some argue that parents is more kind and humble than friends; however, friends would be more kind and humble at some experiences. Many felt fails for living the world; at that times, friends gave encourages and forces to live one more though the world is very complicated and hard to live by young men alone. so, this is because friends are kind and humble.    

To sum up, Both someone's friends and someone's parents are important people for someone to live happy. In my terms of that, friends are slightly more helpful than parents. If anyone is falling into the ground of fail, friends can be falling too not parents because they feel many same things to live together. Even though they are seem to child and stupid person, they sometimes show saints' characters with kind and humble. Everyone can in live hard world with their friends until final of world.  "	4	3.5	4

     Success generally means to become a top in one part, and various ways exist for becoming success. Although some argues that success comes from taking risks or chances, in my opinion, success results from planning. Careful planning can be resulted in success for several reasons. 
     First of all, preparing time is offered in careful planning route. Preparation is quiet necessary for success because people can know themselves well through this process. By preparing, people can know what they are good at and what they are poor at; they can practice their poor part and grow up. Otherwise, without preparation, a given chance can affect their future negatively. 
     In addition to preparing time, people can take proper chance. Some thinks that taking chance is important, but that's not true. Whether they took the chance that suits them or not is important. If they took the wrong one, it might be not helpful for them even if it is a good chance. However, by careful planning, people can look for a chance that suits them perfectly. Taking the proper chance, they can become more successful. 
     Some argues that every famous people made success by unexpected chance or risk. However, people should know that famous people planned long life term plan faster than anyone. Therefore, they could catch a chance at any time which can be seen as taking risk by other people's point of view. They knew how a given chance will affect them and carefully develop that chance in big success. 
     To sum up, careful planning can be resulted in bigger success. By having preparing time, people can be fully ready for a new chance and grow up. Also, they can take a chance that perfectly suits them. Moreover, knowing that every famous person could be successful because of planning. "	4	4	4

	Now a days, people more consider about success than before. Riches are some of the famous people in world, and their books about success stories are best sellers. However not everyone can success in these days. To be a success man, people have to take risks with three reasons: knowledge from failure, salary difference, case of riches.
First of all, people can only learn from failure. People say that failure is the mother of success. People with taking risks can learn much more than people who do not. These experience become basement of future success. 
In addition, the salary difference comes from difference of risks. For instance, Employees and managers get different amount of salary. For employees , they insured about their salary from company, but they are hard to earn lots of money. In case of managers, however, they earn lots of money; because, they have lots of responsibilities for managing companies and lots of risks.
Some say that with risks are hard to success. However several riches have experiences with taking risks, nor can they success without their risks. There are several founders who get out universities. People know that getting out university has much more risks than taking class in university. Since they had decision with risks they can be riches.
To sum up, there are three reasons to take risks: learning from failure, salary gap between people with different risks, stories of riches taking risks.

The reason why I thought like this is based on my personal experience when I am playing online-game or studying. There are mainly three reasons. 
    First reason is knowing what I am doing and what I will do. Not knowing what obstacles stand in my way is a great fear. Also, knowing what I know and what I don't know is big power to solve a problem. If I don't know what I don't know, I may fall into a dilemma. Falling in to a dilemma is very time consuming and stressful situation.
    Second reason is fun. Basically, human beings have nature to play. Enduring boredom is huge pain for human. Doing what I am not good at is boring and it is pain keep doing boring things. When I am good at playing game 'A', it's fun to play game 'A' for me. If I feel fun to play game 'A', then I am motivated to play game 'A' more and more. This virtuous cycle makes me better when I am playing game 'A'. 
    Third reason is being a specialist. As I said above, there's virtuous cycle if I feel fun at doing something. This mechanism makes me specialist at that region. If I am specialist at some region, then there will be someone who need my knowledges or skills. I can give a hand to someone, or I can earn money with my skills. By being a specialist, I can be a person who is needed to someone.

	One more thing is here. In 2021 fall semester, for example, I decided to start the math academy in my hometown, Tong-yeong. Since being a math teacher was one of my dream, I'm very passionate to start academy. I taught students from 11 to 20 age every day. After 6 months from the start, suddenly something went wrong. It was burn-out. I thought I was very willing to teach math to others, it wasn't. I loved to make progress in knowledge in mathematics, but everyday teaching same things was very hard for me to feel improvement. So, I decided to quit and came back to the school.

Others enjoys to search and find a new fields and not afraid to try new things that they haven't experienced before with their own risk. It's almost impossible to say which strategy is right to living, but i think trying new thing as much as possible is way more effective strategy for healthy and sound life even there's some risk exists.
 Do the only job what you already familiar is not a terrible strategy. Repeated task need less effort and experiences that you get on every trials helps you to get better result. This strategy can be justified by the elementary social tends - society always needs ""Experts"" for each field. 
 But keep doing what you already did without any variety has some downside. It is highly likely to make your abilities - for example, mindset, skills - shallow.  And abilities focused only one point are too vulnerable to external situation. For examples, many people such as telephone exchanger, lost their job just because society changes, regardless to their professionality.
 In this aspect, Trying new thing can overcomes the ""do only thing what you can do well"" stretegy's downside. It will helps to get wider view of life. and give flexibility to your life.

Recently, the world has rapidly changed around areas such as culture, climate, economy, etc. Diversity is widespread and threats to our are exponentially increased. So, we always prepare for various circumstances. So, in my case, I pursue that the direction of my life would be dynamic and flexible, too. For now, I will explain my thought for three reasons.
  First of all, things that I already do well can be disappeared or be wasteful in a very short time. In the era of COVID-19, many workers related to the restaurant business and art lost their jobs due to social distance. The reason why they lose jobs is not their mistakes or poor ability, just external factors like a virus.
  Second, from a point of education view, The most important thing is forever learning. Already, there is much uncertainty in this era and we have various risks while living every day. To overcome uncertainty and threats to us, we must have various skills and abilities. Try new more new more
  Third, many problems in the world can be only solved by interdisciplinary knowledge. Now, we lived in a hyper-connect society. For example, economic risks are affected by climates and military conflict.  It is more difficult that solved by deep knowledge about one major. So, it is important to try new majors and subjects and to converge my knowledge
  For three reasons, I prefer to try new things and take risks, and so on, the value of my life is flexibility and diversity"	3	3	3

Between them, I prefer to do only what I already do well. There are three reasons why I like it more.
 First of all, skilled person can reduce time to achieve the goals. For instance, when making a food, skilled person can consider ingredients, cooking time, and other various conditions related to cooking since he or she has lots of similar experiences. However, if a person cooks for the first time, he or she will spend lots of time to complete cooking with trial and error because of the lack of backgrounds.
 Next, skilled people can be professionals in their areas and people will respect it. Trying various things will be helpful but it has difficulty to get high-level knowledge at certain area. However, skilled people always focus on their area and they become experts. When people need help in some situations, they trust experts since experts have plenty of knowledge and experience of that situation.
 Lastly, companies or labs prefer to work with skilled person. Companies or labs should educate unskilled people much more than skilled people. This takes a lot of time and money. They do not want to take risks with it, so choosing skilled people is better choice for them. I will graduate soon and I will decide whether I work at a company or a lab. Thus, I should appeal myself with my own skills and experiences.
 Skilled people have benefits with reducing time, getting respects, and getting jobs. Therefore, I think doing only what I already do well is better option for me."	3.5	3	3.5

Someone chooses the safe way; what they already do well and no risks. And the others choose the new way; try new thing and take risks. I think I am the later one, I prefer try new things, and there are three reasons.
First, trying new things is funny. New experiences refresh our mind, and give new views. Maybe the reason that people loves travel to other country is same.
Second, there is no improvement in safe way. We improve ourselves when we face to new obstacles and overcome it. Of course, overcoming obstacles is very hard thing, because failure is very scary. However, we don’t have to worry about failure; sometimes monkeys fall from tree. Just try again and again, and these tries make you improve.
Finally, take risk means large reward. There are large rewards when we choose new way. Rewards can be the improvement of myself, or relationships for new people, or new knowledge, or new perspective, or above all.
I think try new things has more advantages than the safe way, so I prefer try new things."	3	3	2.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion."	"I prefer to do what I already do well. There are some reasons about that.
 First, obviously, doing what I already do well makes better result that doing new things. For example, I have learned about japanese in middle and high school, So I was good at japanese. when I was freshman in kaist, I took a japanese lecture and thanks to my japanese skill, I got a 'A0' score. But when I was taking a 'law introduction' lecture in freshman, I wasn't familiar with a law, So I got a 'B-' score. Theses example shows that doing what I do well is best choice 


 Second, doing what I already do well gives me much more confidence about tasks. confidence have enormous force. No matter what is difficult problems, It makes me not to give up and keep doing those tasks. This attitude is necessary for the area of scholarship. without confidence about scholarship, we can not keep going over road of scholarship. To get confidence, scientists should work in area of what they know well.


 Third, time and resources are restricted. when I was freshman, I have much passion about learning, So I took a physics, electronic engineering, chemical and even biology. However, a lot of burden of learning makes my life annoying. I just took a biology lecture in curiosity but learning unfamiliar biology takes much time and makes a lot of stress. In the world, there are lots of  scholarship. So, we have to focus on what I do well because our time and resources are restricted.

By above reasons, I prefer to do what I do well and I am sure this method is best choice."	2.5	3	3

"I feel comfortable when I do what I already did well because it is much easier than new things, and especially, I can predict the quality and time that I need. But I enjoy trying new things and taking risks because I have a pioneer's spirit. 
When I do some research or engineering projects, I always prefer to try a new concept or new mechanisms. but new things cause risks on success & failure and schedule. So, To make new things work, not only remain as fancy ideas on paper, I always try to make new concepts with conventional, what I ""already did well"" materials and plans. With the support of proven ones, and safe and reliable ideas, new things can be made safely in time.
I can give you an example of my tactics above. It is about my first journal paper on IEEE RA-L. I wanted to make articulated robots strong and fast. With no revolution in material technology, the reduction gear shifting mechanism was the key. Everybody told me that It will be very hard to make a reliable, light gear shifting mechanism on the articulated robot actuators because no one successfully did that. Of course, I knew that it is a very new concept for articulated robots and the risk of failure. So, during the mechanical design process, I always focused on reliability, and used conventional, proven, and experienced designs in every working process. With this effort, I succeeded to make a working prototype of DRPD, the Dual Reduction ratio Planetary Drive.
With this research, I got an Excellent Award on KAIST URP, and now I am in process of writing a journal paper for IEEE RA-L. I think this research's success is due to the tactics I mentioned above, ""90% of conventional, 10% of new ones"" tactics. I'd like to say people like the sentence below when I talk about the fancy, new ideas, and research. Remember, there are always no 100% new things. especially these days. New things are made of 90% of conventional ones and 10% of actually new ones. "	1	2.5	4

But in fact, I have both sides and the precentages of the degree how much I have that characteristic are 0.55 for taking risks and 0.45 for trying only what I already do well. It's almost similar.
The reason that I prefer to try new things little bit more is that I enjoy escaping normal life. I had trip to Jeju island alone when I was 20. It's not normal to travel alone for young girl, because it can be dangerous. So there are other options such as travel with family or friends. But I desire to have new experience! As a result, it was nice time and I could learn rich things and get wide choices on future.
The second reason is that I want to be special and be first case. It's also because I have 'Just do it!' mind.  For example, I graduate science high school and it was very riskly choice. I was born small country, so there is no past case to enter science high school from my hometown. There is no related acamedy and no teacher to get advice. So many friends was entered normal school and get normal courses. But I felt boring with normal classes that did not consider students' participation or interest. So I want to join special school that can cover my academic interest. Some people can think entering science high school is not new thing, but for my perspective, it's new attempt not just for me, but my middle school and my hometown city. It has big risks such that I cannot follow ciriculum because I didn't study high school course or university course, but many science high school students already learned these. Also I leaved familiar environment and tried to find new friends. But I chose riskly choice and make an example on my hometown. By this choice, many students in my middle school start to enter science high school.
For these reasons, I prefer to try new things. Like two examples, I have other choices that hase no risks. If I travel with friends it might be safe. And If I enter normal high school, I could get high grades easily and not waste time to get familiar with new environment. But I choose riskly choices."	3	3	2.5

First, trying new thing is too hard to satisfy myself. When I do something, I prefer to do as many as possible on that thing. That means, I want to do all contents related to that things. But if just try new thing over and over again, I can't do all contents related to them and never to do well that things. To do something with in-completed state is worst things to me.
Second, even if I do well that things, I can find new aspects of them when doing again and again. And by repeat, I can find another pleasure of them. For example, when I play the game, I usually repeat some specific part with new strategy, method, control etc. And by these, I can experience another feelings on them. Of course, trying new things is restricted, that is, I only change some part of the familiar one. If I try totally new thing, I wouldn't know whether I can change some part of it. Therefore, I'm not going to modify anything of them.
In conclusion, because of my characteristics, and some adventure of familiar one, I choose former opinion.
Thank you."	3	3	3

If  we don't try things that we haven't tried, we can't go upper. Failure can be our experience, and it becomes ground of success. I always look for new things for my fun. Because It makes me exciting and challenging. For example, I like acting these days. I am only good at math and science now, but I want to try new types of work. So I am in play acting circle and voice acting circle, and acting in short movie team. I think I don't act well, but I'm proud of it when my acting skills developes. We can do anything unless it's first time to try. If you have interests of it, your life will be exciting and challenging although it's difficult."	2	2	2.5

  First, if I try new things and fails, then I takes some penalty, but I have many opportunities to success it and can recover that penalty. When I was first grade of high school and took the first exam in my high school, my English grade was respectively better than other students. But in this time, I thought that if I keep this studying method, then my grade will be decreasing in the few years of high school. So, I decided to change my studying method for English. It was risky because if it goes to fail, then my English grade will be low for whole high school grade. For two months to changing my English studying method, in the second exam of high school (final exam of first semester of fist grade), my English grade decreased. But I kept my new method and studied hard, finally my English grade was increasing again in my second grade of high school for using the new English studying method.
Second, If I do only what I already do well, then the ability of the thing that I do not well become more worse and make some problem. When I was a kid, I did well for mathematics but did not well for exercises (physical activity). In that time, I preferred to do only what I already do well that is mathematics and did not prefer to do physical exercises. After many years left, my ability of mathematics went better, but I also had many health problems when I was high school student because I spent very small time to physical activity for many years.
Because of above reasons, I prefer to try new things and take risks. "	3	3	3.5

This situation often occurs on job. In my opinion, I prefer trying new things and take risks. By move into the new situation, we can get over in various situation, and be happy. 
First of all, people who try new things, it makes them crash into various situation. In our life, there are a lot of important point to choose. For example, in Korea, all man have to go into the army. When they are entering, they have to choose what they're going to do such as driving section, airline section, and officer section.  When my friend prefer to try new things so he got drive lisense, or high English score, it will helpful to him.  Like this, trying many things can also make many ways to choose.
It helps to get over in various situation, but also this kind of happening makes happiness. Doing only what people already do well will make them boring. For example, Davinci who is famous artist is good at drawing, but he didn't only draw for his whole life. He did very various thing like making a airplane to fly, and studying human's body. These kinds of things will be his movement to live. That mean, it makes him happy. People can get happiness by try new things and going through new situations.
Trying new things make people developed, and happy. You have to choose many times through your life. At that time, it is impossible to choose what you already do well. Sometimes you can try new things, and that will make your life more exciting. It is not late to learn or try something new."	3.5	3.5	3.5

However, there are another people love to do new things and take risk. Doing new things is good for having new experiences. I prefer to try new things and take risks for three reasons.
 First, not trying new things makes people do other things worse. For example, an athlete who dives very well in China didn't know their languages. He dives very well but he is very bad for Chinese even he is Chinese. This is a very big problem. That's because people cannot live with doing only one thing. However, if he tries other things, he is not only good at diving and Chinese but also other things for living. Therefore, trying new things makes people do many things better.
 Next, trying new things makes chances. There are a lot of types of jobs, sports, majors and studies etc. Therefore, anyone can do many types of things. Plus, a real example for this exists. Bill gates can be the example. He did not graduate the university even he entered a very good university. That is because, he wants to try and concentrate for new things. Now, he is one of the richest people in the world. Therefore, trying new things can make people success.
 Finally, only doing things that they already good at is boring. For instance, in the factory, there are a lot of people who do their job very well. However, when someone asks them ""Are you excited for this work?"", they answered ""No, it's bored."" On the other hand, in the company that has a variety of projects, it is different. When someone asks them for same way, they answered ""Yes, it's good."" Therefore, trying new things is not boring. For these three reasons, I prefer to try new things and take risks."	3	3	3

Some people will continue their work, but other try to take a new challenge that they have not experienced. In these days, I just study some parts of mathematics and physics, and I think it reflects my life style; I prefer to do only what I already do well.
  I would like to do what I have done because I do not want to take risks. The new things are not usually my strengths, and I will have lots of difficulties with spending a plenty of times. For example, I think that I have lack of experiences of artworks. Then, what will happens if I do art right now? I believe that there are lots of failures, and the time that I spend to try new things will be gone. Actually, even if we try to spare our times, we use the times for not important things and it's hard to focus on my main work. I think doing my own work is better to save our times and avoid risks.
  Furthermore, I believe that we need to challenge new things if we still don't know our talents. I have mentioned that nowadays, I study mathematics and physics, and those are not the new ones since I have studied those subjects hard in the middle school and the high school. I sometimes imagine the world that I still try to find my strengths. I believe that I will try to get many opportunities to experience various things, and finally find out my talents as soon as possible. However, I notice that I'm good at mathematics and physics, and now I try to focus on them more than before I knew my talents.
  In total, I like to do only what I already do well rather than to try new things and take risks. There are two reasons: I want to spare my time to focus on my own work and I want to avoid risks; I believe I will try to do new things if I still don't know my strengths. Some people may think differently since there are various characteristics. Especially, there are some people who like to challenge. However, I think they will also agree that we can success earlier and avoid the failures if we concentrate to the things that we have done.

Personally, I prefer to do only what I already do well. There are several reasons and examples as follows.
Firstly, doing something that we already do well is time efficient. In other words, we don't have to spend that much time to be success in that location. For example, when we try new things, we must spend more time to do well and can take risks, too. Accordingly, we can work efficiently when we choose well things.
Furthermore, we can enjoy our work or something that we have to do without lots of stress. That is to say, since we do thing that we good at, we can think we want to do more that thing. For instance, when we get a high score at some subject, we feel interest in that subject. Also, we want more studying of the subject that we do well. Thus, we can get effective mind for our work.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that doing only what we already do well is better than trying new things. That is because, it has time efficiency, and we can enjoy our work."	3	3	3

On the other hands, they like to do what they are not good at. Otherwise, they want to try new things.  In my life there were many challenges to me.  In my opinion, I prefer to try new things and take risks.
First, by failure I could learn many things. In the last semester, I took an analysis 1 course. I was not good at mathematical skills, so the midterm score was not satisfied. I reviewed and checked the style of studying of me. This helps improving mathematical skills and view of analysis. Like this, taking risks is not always failure. I think  it could be the stairs to go to next steps.
Second,  improving new skills could affect to the other challenges so we can learn even more than we challenge just a single things. I was a dodgeball player in the middle school. This makes me healthy and also helps to study longer. Another case is about piano. I played piano since I was 4 years old. So, I could improve music skills. Guitar is very different from the piano. Nevertheless, what I have learned in the piano class helps to learn guitar. In my opinion, every experience is meaningful for our life.
In conclusion, I prefer challenge and experience for the new one. This is because, we can learn from the failure and each experience can affect to the next experience. So, I want to suggest you to try everythings what you want."	3	3	3	
1043	Lifestyles: Some people prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day’s work. Others prefer to get up later in the day and work until late at night. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.	"The need to get up and work early
     Knowing which one is more efficient between working during the day or working at night is a very important issue for working people. Some prefer to get up early because if they wake up early in the morning, they feel like a long day. Others prefer to get up later because working late at night makes them less tired. However, there are several reasons why it is better to get up early in the morning to get to work.
     First of all, if someone go to bed late and wake up late, the quality of sleep will be poor, and this inevitably leads to a decrease in work efficiency. Biologically, humans sleep better when the sun goes down. If someone go to bed late, the sun will rise while they are sleeping and the sun will reduce the quality of their sleep. This naturally leads to a decrease in work efficiency. Therefore, it is much more effective to go to bed early and get up early to work in order to improve the quality of sleep and increase work efficiency.
     In addition, working late can make it difficult to socialize with other people. Most people have their own time after the evening hours. They also use this free time to meet friends and spend time with their family. However, working late and sleeping late can make it difficult to spend time with other people. Humans are social animals, and those who have a rich social life have a high quality of life. If someone go to bed late and wake up late, they will not have a good social life.
     Some people claim that working late is much less tiring when working. However, this is an incorrect claim. The minimum amount of sleep required for an adult is set at about 8 hours. The most important thing is a regular sleep pattern. Going to bed at the same time and waking up at the same time is a way to improve sleep quality. When the quality of sleep is guaranteed, someone will feel much less tired at work. The reason working late makes them feel less tired is most likely because they didn't sleep late the night before or woke up late because of laziness. Therefore, it is more important to go to bed early, wake up early, and repeat the same sleep pattern every day.
     To sum up, it's much better to go to bed early and work early. If someone go to bed early and work early, they can improve the quality of their sleep, which leads to improved work efficiency. In addition, they can enjoy their time with their loved ones, and their quality of life will improve. It is important to have a regular sleep pattern so that they do not feel tired while working. If someone gets up late and prefers to work late, that person will have to sacrifice quality sleep and precious time with the people around them."	4.5	4.5	4

In KAIST library, one can see that some people study until the dawn, others study in the morning. Someone says that it is beneficial to get up later in the day and work until late at night. Others argue that it is better to get up early in the morning and start the day's work. Early start of the day in the morning has several benefits.
First of all, it is healthy to wake up in the morning. Human beings are supposed to sleep at night and work at noun over and over time. Humans need a rest at night and some hormones help them to be comfortable. Sleeping at night is more helpful than in the morning. After waking up in the morning, people face the Sun; so, they can start the day happily. 
In addition to the health, people can live a day more efficiently. There is a terminology 'miracle morning' which says humans can make a miracle by waking up early in the morning. Miracle morning can make people read the books, think about a life, and plan a day. By waking up early in the morning, people can organize the day more efficiently and they will construct well-organized lifestyle.
On the other hand, some still argue that to get up later in the day and work until late at night is more beneficial. They say that working at night is more efficient since it is quiet at night. However, it is not the only case that working at night is efficient. If some need quiet circumstances while working, they can even find such places at noun. Moreover, health is much more important than working efficiency so that waking up in the morning helps people to be happier.
To sum up, to get up early in the morning and start the day's work is beneficial for several reasons. Those who are waking up early can be healthy by sleeping at night and make their life more organized. Even though working at night might be helpful and beneficial, health is more important in their lives. In the end, to get up early in the morning will make people happier."	4.5	4	4

Just as like the rabbit and turtle, two type of lifestyle exist: people who always rushing on everything;  people who can have their time for rest. Some says hurry lifestyle make people's lives more valuable. Other argue that people should take time to relief in their lives. In my opinion, the lifestyle that being hurry is beneficial than the lifestyle with slower pace for several reasons.
First of all, Being hurry gives safety margin in several situations. Since the most works in life has deadline, people must do their works on in certain amount of times. However, doing their job just on time could make serious mistake because of lack of time to revise; thus, people can avoid such risk and get better result by being hurry and end the jobs early. For example, finishing the exam earlier can gives times to fix mistakes before the exam end. 
In addition to the safety aspect, Being hurry make people archive the result quickly. the most achievement requires efforts. Not surprisingly, being hurry can bring the result to people faster. Because every field in modern society is on competition, people who want to achieve significant result on their field must being hurry.
Some argue with people need to take their time to avoid exhaustion. Obviously, Take a rest is inevitable for healthy life. However, by minimizing the time to relief, people can spend their time in more valuable ways. If someone want to archive, sacrificing the personal time and tighten the belt should be necessary. 
To sum up, being-hurry lifestyle is much desirable than lifestyle with slow pace in various aspect. Being hurry provide soundness of peoples's works. Quick result can be archived with hurry lifestyle. Being hurry is necessary to people who want to unignorable result on their field. In this aspect, people should be hurry on many situation for sound and healthy life."	4	4	3.5

Besides this background of this start, the work efficiency of people differs depending on time. In my opinion, it is better to get up early in the morning and start the day's work for two reasons.
First of all, getting up early is helpful for mental health. Bio-rhythm of humans is affected by hormone and hormone-regulated overall body condition. If they work at night and then sleep late, hormone, melatonin that has a role in controlling emotion, cannot be created properly. Because this hormone can be created for the maximum in the daytime; as a result, it refreshes mental conditions clear.  For example, occur rate of mental illness is lower by 3 times in the case of the person who has a day working type rather than a night working type. Therefore, day working type is more efficient to work thanks to a healthy mental condition.
In addition to mental health, the day working type is better for co-working. Most of the workers work in the day. If one person in the team starts to work late, team members' work may be delayed and disturbed by one person. It can be happened inefficient and unfair situations for the team, frequently. It results in lower efficiency of teamwork. For example, in the case of a team that has face-to-face meetings originally, they start to communicate through the online channel because of the flexible working culture. As a result, they deliver their opinion in terms and then their communication of time cost are increased.
Some argue that getting up early makes workers harder. This idea supports by the that many workers suffer from traffic jams in the morning. However, now, many companies recommended in-home work because workers prevent wasting time moving, and their company buildings convert to another purpose, not working. They can be negligent for moving time and can focus on getting up early.
To sum up, the day working type is better than the night working type for mental health and co-working."	4	4.5	4

 First of all, the sunlight is an effective strategy of getting up unstressfully. The sunlight is the main cause of breaking a sleep. People get up easily when the sunlight is exposed to them because the brain recognizes it. While other strategies such as setting alarm for several times or asking family and friends for a morning call are stressful, using the sunglight is a natural and unstressful way to get up. Since the sun rises in the morning, it is a good choice to get up early in the morning for the unstressful start of the day.
 In addition to unstressful getting up by the sunlight, people can have a breakfast and start the day actively. Having a breakfast gives a brain the energy for starting the day's work, so people can spend their time actively. Moreover, it sends a signal to human's organs that he or she is awake; as a result, the organs activate their functions safely.  After the breakfast, people can solve the negative effects of being hungry as well. Feeling hungry invokes people stress and worries, but they can feel relax and happiness by having a breakfast.
 Some argue that it is unevitable to wake up later in the day due to lots of works; however, waking up early in the morning enables working effectively. The workers can focus on their work in the worktime when they get up early in the morning; thus, they can finish their work in a relatively short time. They do not have to work until late at night and can relax at night. The repetition of such days regularly makes the workers refresh and  work actively for the next days. It may be true that people should work until late at night due to serious problems or important meetings sometime; however, the habit of getting up early helps people recover their tiredness, and helps people keep their healthy lifestyles.
 To sum up, getting up early has three positive effects: it can be unstressful by using the sunlight, the breakfast makes people start the day actively, and it helps people work effectively. It has significant benefits when people get up early in the morning. If people try to get up early in the morning, they can make a meaningful day."	4.5	4.5	4.5

   Nowadays, there are many patterns on working, for the advance of technologies. With the discovery of electricity, people can work at night. Some prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day's work, and others prefer to get up later and work at night. Get up later and work until late at night is better for some reasons.
   First of all, working at night is enough time passed from getting up. When start the day's work as soon as getting up early, it is hard to concentrate on work well because it is too sleepy. In contrast, work at night, concentration for work is better, for enough time passed from waked-up. It means clear condition can obtain working at night. The way that working in best condition is working after totally wake-up. 
  In addition, some obstacles that hinders work are less at night. If the work starts in morning, the working flow is discontinuous because there are break times for meals. The continuous working flow is important for good work result. Also, noises that make us annoying are much less at night. The night is quiet clear; it is the perfect condition for working.
  Some says that start the day's work in morning can be working with fresh feeling. It may right; however, fresh feeling and good result of working does not have well relationship. Fresh feeling is just kind of feeling; it does not necessary for good result. The important point for good result is concentration on working, not fresh feeling. 
   To sum up, get up later and work at night is better because it can concentrate more on working. The conditions for working at night is better than in morning. Start your working at night and get better result."	4	4	4

Some of them prefer to work in the night, or others want to work in the morning. There are mixed opinions about this argument because both of them have a pros and cons. In my opinion, getting up early and starting the work is a beneficial for several reasons.
     First of all, getting up early is good for healthy. human has a biological rhythm that he or she wakes up when sun rises and sleeps down when sun set. If we destroy a biological rhythm, the immune system is damaged. For example, the bones weakens, the dark circle appears, the digest system does not works properly. Therefore, getting up later and working until late at night hurts the healthy. 
     In addition to healthy, getting up and processing the task early is good for the mental. If the task is complete late, the burden makes the stress, which cause negative emotions. However, when the task is dealt with early, the employee gets away from the pressure of the task. It makes their mental healthy; they can live a healthy life.
     Some people argue that they can efficiently concentrate on the task at late night. However, it's just a psychological illusion. they can focus on the task with same concentration when they get up early. There is no evidence that working at night is better than at the morning if the condition such as the sleeping time is same. 
     To sum up, working in the early morning is a best choice in terms of the body and mental healthy. There is no advantages of working at late night even in the aspect of the concentration. The healthy life comes when people get up and start their work early.  "	4	4	4

These days, in Korea, people focus on success by taking risks, such as investing in virtual money like BitCoin, not by plan and steady work. As the society becomes more stabilized, as side effects, the ladder of the class movement collapsed, and this kind of atmosphere has been widely spread. Some believe that if someone wants to succeed, they have to take big risks. However, if someone wants to succeed in life, planning with careful thoughts should be accompanied, not only by taking risks.
First of all, in the view of one person, the strategy of taking risks can not be a long-term strategy. In one or two cases, it can be successful; however, from the view of probability, as the risk-taking times get larger and larger, the probability of collapse becomes close to 100%. In other words, if someone takes a risk many times, the person will defeat with a high probability. This is the simple and most important logical reason why people should focus on planned life.
In addition, in the view of society,  if there are too many people who focus on taking risks, not on working steadily with a plan, it can cause depression. For example, if most people focus on investing their all savings in BitCoin, and do not work, the company will not be able to make money, and it will directly become the reason for the depression. To make society work efficiently,  society needs earnest workers, not gamblers.
To sum up,  in the point of one person and the society, people should focus on planned working, not gambling. Some say that these days, the rapid growth period had ended, and someone can succeed only by taking a big risk in life. This kind of person says that ""Life is one shot, friend."" Of course, on the way to success, some risks exist because life is so complex and hard to predict."	3.5	4	4.5

One of the pattern of dailiy life is getting up early in the morning or getting up late in the day. Many researchers debate which life pattern is better for human and why some life pattern is better than the other. In my opinion, getting up early in the morning and startting the day's work is a better life style for several reasons.
First of all, people who get up early in the morning can be exposed to sunlight for a long time than people who get up late. Sunlight exposure is important; because, it gives not only physical energy but also mental energy. Also, sunlight has necessary viatamin such as viataminD. Sun existed about 6am to 6pm in a day; therefore, a person who get up around 6am could enjoy sunlight's benefits, but others cannot enjoy whole time. Therefore, getting up early is better to have a time with sunlight.
In addition, working until late at night is negative for the brain development. Sleep is a crucial activity; because, it is a rest time for human body and brain. During this time, the brain activity such as thinking and creativity begin to inactivity, and brain prepare tomorrow. For this reason, working at late night is not efficient and prevent brain development. Therefore, getting up early and working in the morning promotes brain development and give an efficiency of working.
Some argue that life pattern with working until late at night is more appropriate for KAIST students; however, this opinion is not a fact, and diverse counter-examples existed. In KAIST, several students do their homeworks and group activities at night is true, but diverse students who do their works in early morning also existed. They wake up early and prepare classes and schedules.
To sum up, getting up early in the morning is better than getting up later in the day. Because it gives a lot of benefits such as sunlight exposure and brain development. However, a different person has a different fit life pattern, so trying both getting up early and getting up late is important before choosing one option."	4	4	4

There are two kinds of life-pattern exist: waking up in morning and start the day's work earlier, and waking up after morning and start the day's work later. Some wake up early because of their work time, and others wake up late because of their tiredness. Waking up early and waking up late have many pros and cons about them. In my opinion, starting the day's work in the morning is better for several reasons.
First of all, waking up in the morning can save the time for working. If workers wake up late and start their jobs after the morning, the efficiency of communications between co-workers should be decreased. Because many workers in society wake up early and start to work their jobs. And decreasing of the efficiency means that their working time is expanded. It is nightmare to everyone. So, waking up early in the morning can make workers to work in the same time with their partners, and save the working time by increasing of the efficiency.
In addition to saving a working time, waking up in the morning is good for health. Health is one of the most important element for human's happiness. According to WHO, he/her who experienced the broken of a sleeping pattern has high probability to suffer from the depression. Getting up later in the day and work until late at night can cause the broken of a sleeping pattern, and it is harmful to human's mental health. Therefore, getting up early in the morning can make he/her more happier and more healthier.
Some argue that waking up in the morning is too tired; therefore, they need to sleep in more hours. However, they are misunderstanding about the causes of their tiredness. They are tired because they didn't sleep earlier at last night. If they slept before 12 pm at last night, they would easy to wake up before 8 am; because, nearly 8 hours is sufficient for human's sleep. Therefore, the problem of insufficient of sleeping time can be improved by changing their sleeping time. 
To sum up, waking up in the morning is better than waking up after the afternoon to start the day's work. It is because waking up in the morning is good not only for saving the time for working but also for health. Also, tiredness of waking up in the morning can be solved by changing the sleeping pattern. So, everyone's life quality can be improved by waking up early in the morning."	4.5	4	4

Many workers work from 9am to 6pm. They must wake up early. However, students who are on, vacation are not. They can choose one of life pattern: morning-type human or night-type human. The sleep time of each method is same, but it is divided according to which time zone they mainly work and play. If it has same sleeping time, getting up later in the day is better.
First of all, feeling in the morning is more sleepy than night. At night, many people can endure with coffee and willingness. However, they cannot wake up easily if they did not sleep a lot. They sometimes do not wake up despite of alarm. It is easier to stay awake than to struggle to get up.
In addition, night-type people can have free-time at night. If they finish work earlier than usual, they can enjoy a peaceful breaktime alone because it is not yet time to sleep. For example, they can watch movies on Netflix. Also, they can have a drinking party until late because they get up late.
Some people say morning-type human is more dilligent. However, the difference between two is not dilligence, but life patterns. Night-type humans just prefer to work and play in night. It is better to work hard at night than to be sleepy in the morning.
In conclusion, night-type humans are not sleepy in the morning. Also, they can have breaktime after work and drunk with friends. Sleeping well comes from sleeping late."	4	4	3.5

For many people, there are many assignments for them, so they may spend a lot of time to these assignments. These situations make people get up early in the morning or sleep later at night. Although some people have habits that is to get up later and work until late at night, in my opinion, getting up early and starting the day's work are better habit for several reasons.
First of all, getting up early is better choice for health. Human's body prefers to eat meals in three times at morning, lunch time, and evening. People can eat breakfast if they get up early, so they become more healthy to compare with others that had not eaten breakfast. Human's body also prefers to do activity such as working in day, and it prefers to sleep in night. If people get up early, they can finish their assignments before sunsets or appropriate sleeping time; then, they become more healthy.
In addition to become more healthy, doing work in the day is effective. Humans have their body rhythm, that is more activate in the day, so they can do more in the day. For example, people prefer to exercise in the morning because the body is more prepared to compare with night. Also, experts on education make timetable of school early and in the day, for doing work in the day is effective. 
Some people argue that people are silence in night, so working until late at night is better.  However, in some case, it is still noisy in night; there are many loud noises such as baby's crying or other people's footstep noise at night. Furthermore, silence place is also exist in the day; for example, library or place for reading book is silence at all time. Also, people use several things such as ear plug to defend the noise.
To sum up, getting up and starting work early in morning is better habit because it is good for health, effective, and to exist the method of defend the noise. People who start early can go further. With habit that getting up and starting work early, people will live in better life in the long term."	4	4	4

These days, various kinds of jobs appear, and it makes people have a different lifestyles. People who have to work at night like BJ prefer to work until late at night; however, others who are salesmen prefer getting up early. In my opinion, getting up early in the morning helps the body be healthy and helps people work stable.  
First of all, waking up early can make people healthier. From 12 to 2 am which is time to sleep, the body makes some good materials. However, when they are awake all night, the body cannot make good materials. Also, the body can get into a good sleep state when they sleep at a dark site, not a bright site the sun already appeared. The body changes its state through the brightness, so sleep time effort to health problems. 
In addition, getting up early and starting the day makes people work more stable. In general, limit of the work is 12 am. In the case of night people, they have only a few hours like 10 hours to finish it. In contrast, morning people have enough time to finish it. They will be less stressed about the time limit and complete it with stability. 
Some argue that working until late increases work efficiency. However, it does not matter for the time. Any scientific research, which is about concentration at night is better than morning, is announced until these days. Because each people have different characteristics, the time that they can pay attention is different. Some will concentrate even better in the morning.   
To sum up, starting the day early can not only improve the body state but also help people work more stable. If people do not sleep early and be active over the night, it will ruin the body. It makes people have more good life. "	4	4	4

     Recently, the effectiveness of time use is one of the most controversial topics. Some believe that working at night is more effective than waking up early. Others say that starting the day early is better than ending the day later. In my opinion, getting up is better than working until late at night for several reasons.
     First of all, the usual works are mostly in the day. Students or workers can only go to schools or companies at time when they woke up early. If they got up late, they should be late. Plus, if they get up late a lot of times, they should be tired in the work or study of the day. It can cause severe problems to them because the day is their working or studying time that is the most important.
     In addition, getting up early solves health problems. If getting up early, it can be a opportunity to eat breakfast. Breakfast can solve a lot of problems such as cold, obesity, and cancer that are serious diseases. Waking up early is also better to maintain bright eyes because eyes should be worse when someone does somethings at night. Getting up early makes more stronger, for giving time to exercise is an important thing for humans lives.
     Some argue that the best time to study is night; however, it is better to study in the morning. Because the night is the end of the day, some say that they can summarize what they learn in the night; so, it is better to study at night. Although summarizing main points in night can be possible, it is bad to concentrate at night. Studying at morning is easier than studying at night, for the morning is much brighter than the night. Furthermore, the morning is the time that the brain is in the most activate state. 
     To sum up, waking up early is much more effective way to live than going to the bed late. Anyone can start usual works at time and solve health problems. Plus, it is comfortable to study at morning although some say that the night is the best.  As a result, getting up early can be the best choice for humans."	4.5	4	4

        Sleeping is a basic way to relax for all organisms. Thus, sleeping is necessary for human although it needs very long hours; the sleeping time human needed is about from seven to ten hours. Some says that getting asleep and waking up early should be better to spare daytime. On the other hand, others argue that getting up later is better to use the nighttime. In my opinion, getting up in the morning and starting the day's work has two benefits.
        First of all, humans usually concentrate well after getting up. Assume that enough time for sleeping is provided, and then all parts of body, especially human's brain will get enough time to rest; therefore, the concentrating ability is usually maximized after getting up. Notice that people usually have some plans that cannot be canceled due to the importance in afternoon. If there are not only a personal work to concentrate but also some plans in the afternoon such as meeting, sparing the time in the morning by getting up earlier will help to work with high efficiency.
        In addition to high concentration, getting up early helps to take health. For example, young children grow up when they sleep, and they can grow well when they sleep early and get up early. Getting asleep late at night is not helpful for growing up for children. Furthermore, the period of hormones are disturbed by getting asleep late at night because some hormones are used for human's body during sleeping. Human's body is set for the custom, which is getting up early and sleeping early.
        Some argue that after working, leisure is need before sleeping. They think that there must be a gift after doing a hard-work. However, sleeping must be the gift, not other leisures. Note that the time of leisure is not fixed. If any leisure activities are conducted between the work and sleeping, the leisure activities will cause non-periodic sleeping and make the health worse.
        To sum up, getting up early is necessary since sparing the daytime gives efficient works, and helps to keep all parts of body healthy. Getting sleep and waking up early are the base of steady life. Getting up early will lead to sparing time, working with high concentration, and finally there are some space to have leisure. Early bird catches not only the worm but also other parts of happiness."	4.5	4.5	4.5

  These days, there are two main types of time to get up.  Some people prefer to get up early in the morning, while others prefer to get up later in the morning. These two types have pros and cons. In my opinion, getting up early in the morning and starting the days' work is better.
  First of all, early to bed and early to rise is good for health. The human body is harmonized to the pattern of waking up in the morning and sleeping at night. The internal system of the body work normally when the biorhythm matches on morning pattern. Normal biorhythm has a great influence on health. If people wake up late and sleep late, their biorhythm will break and health will fail.
  In addition, getting up early fits well with the opening and closing time of external facilities. People usually get up and eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner. General meal time will be similar to the time for a day of eating when they wake up early. Each person has a different eating time, but external facilities such as restaurants, cafes, and places to play fixed the operating time. If people want to use external facilities according to the operating time, they will have to wake up early and live.
  Some argue that sleeping late gives them more time to spend a day. However, waking up early can make the day longer and more leisurely. The time in the morning will be longer as people wake up early. When they need more time, they can sleep a little later that day, so they will have time. If they wake up late and don't have enough time at the end of the day, there will be no way. People have to wake up early so that they can flexibly increase and reduce the time to play or work.
 To sum up, to wake up early in the morning is better. The main reasons are health, external facilities and time to spend a day. Therefore, people should wake up early and start the day to feel these good advantages."	4.5	4.5	4.5

Some would prefer to get up early, but others would prefer to get up later. In my opinion, To get up early is better than the other for several reasons.
First reason is that to get up early can help to fix the regular schedule. Most schedules in society are set by morning-style people. For example, economic schedules such as stock markets and banks are opened in the morning and closed before dinner. Schools and most workplaces also start at 8. Therefore, To get up early has many benefits in the society.
In addition, it makes people healthier. Most of people who get up early always take their breakfast. Breakfast provides an energy to work before lunch. Also it is good for diet. Because one's stomach is not empty, Overloading can be prevented.  Since breakfast is a benefit of to get up early, it can be led to healthy body.
Some argue that to get up later is better in utilization because of a longer sleep. Since their are many types of people, every sleeping time is not equal, so some will sleep longer than others.  Considering it, if he or she needs more sleep at night, he or she should sleep earlier. It is irrational to argue to get up later can be led to shorten a sleep.

Even if you fail to your goal for new one, your experience and wise that you obtain from new things, is helpful to other challenge or your own doing before.
Second, life motivation  can be grown by your new challenge. If you do same thing during all of your life that make your life boring and terrible.  For trying something new, you have to study and practice. This preparation is important because it is first step to achieve your new goal, and it make you joy your life. In my case, my goal was to be a track athlete when I was middle school student, but 3 year later that I pratice, it too boring and not fun. So I try new one, science. It's so fun and motivate me.

"We already did many risky choices in our life, and we can know what we can do well briefly.

I also interested at music class, but my skills and talents are not good as math. So I could dream musician's life, I did not try that thing because I hate taking dangerous road without safe road I already have and know.
I think that all people have talents in different ways, and people who don't have talents in something can't beat opposite people who have talents in same thing if same time gives them. If non-talented people want to win talented people, they spend a lot of time or money.
In my case, I never try something that I already know I can't do well. It takes my time and effort that It can spend something I already do well.

That situation needs new design to our server. So I have to learn micro-service to redesign our server. When we want to make our service faster, I learned about database and optimize queries.

"Through out the life, we have many chances to choose which work to do and there are two types of person: some people wants to take a risk, try new things and others want to keep doing what they are already good at. For my own situation, I prefer to do only what I can already do well and there are couple of reasons.
 Firstly, I should be a professional in one specific domain. Nowadays, importance of professionality is keep growing as society is becoming more and more complex. Only professionality assures me that I am useful in some specific domain and I can live wealthy with my own professionality. If I try a lot of domains, I will just learn very small part of that domain and that will not be useful.
 Secondly, doing what I already do well is much interesting than tring new things. There are many steps to try new things. We need to search backgrounds, spend a lot of time to be familiar with that work, money, etc. Moreover, there is no guarantee that new thing is interesting and worth to do before we actually try it.  However, if I do what I am already good at, I don't have to worry about such things and people tend to get more interests in domain that they are already know well about.
 Finally, my personality is not well suit for taking risk. I always prefer predictable and safe things. For example, I do not invest my money on small companies that are not well known and hate doing extreme sports. Doing new things is same for me. It is not predictable and safe. Thus, I don't want to take risk to do new things."	3.5	3.5	3.5

Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion."	"I prefer to do only what I already do well.
First, if I try new things and see people who do well on that area, I am sad. I can't do well on every task. For example, I do well programming than other people, but they do well biology than me. In that case, if I start to study biology with the experts, I tend to think that I'm not a good person than them, so I shrink every time. So I don't want to do new things.
In last semester, I take ""Human-Computer Interaction"" course with my two friends. The course include some designing process, so we have to design the app's appearance. I am not good at designing and drawing somethings, but my two friends are girls, especially, one friend take double-major in Industrial Design, so they did well than me. During the semester, I think that I am burden on my friends and I am not giving help to them, so it was really hard time to me. So I like what I can do well.
Next, I feel happy when people trust me on specific area, and say that I did a good job on the tasks. When I do a project with other students, I always worried about other student's feedback on my work. So, if they appreciate my work, I feel proud on me, and I do more work, so it gives me positive feedback on me.
I studied hard in middle school, and high school because of my parent's happiness face. Studying is really painful and hard to me, however when I get a good grade, I enjoy good word from my parent, teachers, and lots of surrounding people. Good word makes me dance, and it gives me more energy."	2.5	3	3

Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion."	"I prefer to try new things sometimes rather than always doing what I already do well. Because new trials bring me unexpected results. In my opinion based on several experiences in life, these unexpected results are often connected to interesting events. For example, one day, I just decided to go through unusual path to school. Usual path was taking bus, but I took subway that day. Even though my naver map said subway will take slightly longer time, but I just decided without specific reason. Luckily, there was small event that giving free coffee to customers in order to advertise something. Furthermore, subway just arrived as soon as I walked into station, so I could spend less time than usual. By small trial such as taking unusual path, I got free coffee and saved times. That's why I enjoy to try new things. Only new trials can change my life."	2.5	2.5	3

There are several reasons. 
First, doing only what we already do well can not give new realization to us. It is just reviewing. We can not learn anything from that. For example, if we do programming what we already experienced, we can not learn new method or new programming grammar. If we retain doing only what we already experienced while some people try new things for long time, in the future, we cannot be better programmer compared to other people. 
Second, if we try new things, we can learn something new.  For example, if we try to programming by using new method that we did not experience, we can learn new method and new framework. Furthermore, new method can be more effective way compared to original method. It makes our code effectively. This experience make us better programmer.  
Third, risk is not always critical. Small risk that we experience during learning new things is not a critical risk.  For example, let's think about situation when we do programming. If we try to add new method that we can not experience to our code, we take risks because if we cannot apply new method successfully, it just can waste much time. But wasting much time is just small risk because we can learn something new realization while add new method, although it can not be completed successfully. 
Last, we can overcome our limitation. If we overcome difficulties that we experience while we try new things, we can increase our capability and overcome limitation. Let's think about the example that I mentioned before again. When we try to add new method and complete it successfully, we can get ability about new method.  So, we can overcome our limitation.
From these reasons, I prefer to try new things and take risks."	3	3.5	3.5

Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion."	"I prefer to try new things over doing what they already do well. There are two reasons that I like new things. 
First, my temperament is open to new things. I heard psychologists call this trait openness and I get high mark on this. So I'm easy to have curiosity to new things and it leads to take risks. For example, I like programming which takes endless learning new things. With high openness, I learned so many things about programming through internet. Internet use requires somewhat curiosity so people who hate new things don't use internet as learning tool. For instance, there was statistics that Windows users who are open to new things downloaded the early day version of Google Chrome browser. Chrome is not basic browser so only ""brave"" people tried it.
Second, there's gain from doing new things. And I want to take it while managing risks. The Chrome browser I mentioned above was better than Internet explorer. But before I use it, I can't know. In this case risk is very low. If you don't like it, you can just delete it and use basic browsers. In contrary there're many higher risky challenges in the world. Even if my openness is high, few successive failures can lead me to helplessness, getting overwhelmed or even death. So I need kind of behavioral system that sustain my curiosity and risk to do new things. Nassim Taleb call things which get gain from uncertainty anti-fragile. He said that wind blow off a candle light, but camp fire grows with it. For example of anti-fragile strategy, I can buy a stock with foot option which gain from value crush. With this behavior I lose cost of option but I don't lose everything from market crush.
In short, I like new things because of my openness in personality and desire to gain from new things. With anti-fragile behaviors, I can sustain my preference to new things."	3	3	3.5

"I like to learn various exercises such as climbing, football, etc. Also, I enjoy trying to make new delicious foods. As I reveal in many hobbies, I prefer to try new things and take risks than doing only what I already did well. There are several reasons that I like to experience new things.
First, when I always do the same thing and do not try new exciting things, it makes me bored. Let's imagine if I cook some menu only with the same recipe and food everyday, or only write an essay, I will be sick of cooking and writing even though I really do well and like to do them. On the other hand, doing something in a new way makes me excited. People get fear when they do what they never did but simultaneously, they feel the heartbeat with hoping for the new world. 
Second, when I do not challenge new things, I cannot grow and be developed. Some things that I already do well must be challenged by previous ""I"", and to become a more available person in the future, I make new ""what I do well"" by trying new things with taking risks. Also, as I mentioned in the previous paragraph, I can experience the new world. In the new world, I do not always succeed. However, in the failure, I can learn more precious values, too. 
To sum up, I like to try new challenges and take risks. Doing things that I always did and already did well is boring and this makes me that I cannot be developed more. However, challenging new things makes me excited, and I can feel that I become more valuable person. This question has no answer. But, I hope that many people always challenge new things even if they take some risks because this makes people happier."	3	3	3

" This may be a complicated question if we take a decision in various situation. Because many people may not make a consistent decision or behavior in different situations depends on what situation is. In my case, although I like to play and study what I usually do, I prefer to study or do experiment new topic or new field in research. So in this question, we need to set a boundary for answering, and I will give my answer in my expected career and job. With respect to bounded question as I limited in above, I prefer to do what I already do well. There are 3 reasons I prefer to do the task that I do well.
 First, it is hard to try new things for me. Since I have learned a lot of studies and researches in my field, my thinking algorithm is optimized and over-fitted to my field. I feel more comfortable with several mathematical and statistical expressions, A.I. structures, and computer languages than others. So, I think that I will have a hard time if I try new things.
 Second, I don't feel that I have to try new things. There will be lots of knowledge that I have to learn in my field in the future. Since I want to focus this, there is no reason or factor that makes me feel to try new things.
 Finally, the task and study that I already do well is what I like to do. When I was a child, I like the study that I do well because many people encouraged me. Until now, the study that I did for a long time becomes what I do well and I like to do. Although I have a hard times to learn sometimes, I'm pleasure to study this field that I love.
 For these reasons, I would like to decide what I already do well in my career if someone force me to decide one among two; try new or not."	2.5	2.5	2.5

Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion."	"  I prefer to try new things and take risks because of two reasons. 
  The first reason is that I learn more and grow faster when I dive in new areas that I don't know. I think the steepness of learning curve on certain domain differ based on your knowledge and capability about the domain. It is fast as you start to learn about the domain since there are so many things to consume. But after passing some point of knowledge, it starts to slow down and saturate to certain level due to lack of sources and mannerism. I value growth and learning, hence feel unsatisfied and frustrated when I feel like I am not learning from the thing I work on. And according to my experience about the relation of learning curve and knowledge, that point usually comes and makes me less productive. So whenever that happens, I tend to find new sources of knowledge by challenging on new fields. By doing this, I can escape the pit of stagnation and start growing again. One of my personal experience about this was changing my major from Physics to Computer Science. I studied physics form my middle school and became a physics major here at KAIST, which is about 7 years of studying Physics. From some point, I found myself learning slowly and feeling tired about physics, which felt very frustrating and depressing. So I took a chance to take CS course with my CS major friend, and I have learnt so much new things from that one course compared to other 3 physics course I took that semester and studying CS helped me get out of depression and made me passionate again. After this experience, I changed my major to Computer Science, and I am still learning so many things and passionate about my new major.
  The second reason is that trying new things creates diverse opportunity when combined with what you are already good at in ways that you never imagine. After changing my major, I almost erased all my memories about physics and thought things I learnt in physics would never appear in my life again. But after 3 years, I met them again in my individual research which was about computer graphics and machine learning. I faced lots of mathematical formulations that I have met in physics and memories of physics helped me a lot. It was a very pleasing experiencing synergy of the things I liked, and like now. I wouldn't have experienced it if I did not take the risk of changing my major."	3	3	3.5

"There is a sentence ""between B and D there is C"" which means between birth and death we have so many chances to choice such things and that choice is really important. Probably the most usual choice in our lives, is choosing some task in their job. some people like to try new things and take risks while other prefer to do what they already do well. this is really hard choice but i prefer to try new things and take risks. and from now on, I will tell you why.
First, trying new things help us to develop ourselves. when trying new things, we should work harder because there are no one to teach some cheats. According to my experience, when studying without some past exams solutions, I could learn more. All the procedure that I try to study that subject by own, have been the ingredients to grow well. So failure when trying new things is not a failure, it also helps you to develop. 
Second, trying new things are inevitable. when doing only what I already well, there must be some point that I can't do anything more. we can see this situation in the real world too. For example, we used to use the fuel  however nowadays, the fuel might seem to be gone. So inevitably, we have to find new energy sources. like this situation, we inevitably meet the point that we have to try new things. So I prefer to do that bit earlier than others.
For conclusion, I prefer to try new things and take risks. As I said before, I don't think it makes risk. It will help me to develop more. And also we will meet some point that we should have to do some new things. Because there are no eternal existence in the world. So how about doing some new things bit earlier than others, and invent some nice things."	3	3	3

"There are many people that just do only what they already do well, since it is convenience way to live. They can show the performance more on average. Actually, I'm one of those people, too. However, I think that it is not right way. I prefer to try new things and take risks, and I want to be those people.
The world is changing dynamically. Think about just 3 years ago. At that time, we cannot imagine Covid-19. We cannot imagine the people that always need to wear the mask. We cannot imagine the situation that we cannot go trip to other country. Every year, every month, and everyday, there must be a difference compared to past days. In this context, people need to change frequently, because the people that like to do only what they already do well cannot adapt well to the changed world.
Also, some people says that doing only what they already do well is excited, since just they can do well. They think that it is fun to show better performance always. Actually, I thought like that before, too. However, as time goes on, it is obvious that those things are not excited. Trying new thing is more excited, although we take risks, because we can learn many things from this, and we can improve us.
To summarize, I prefer to try new things and take risks, rather than doing only what I already do well. The first reason is that it is more appropriate mind to adapt to rapidly changing world, and the second reason is that it is more excited, since we learn new thing and improve ourselves. Actually I don't do this well, since I was tired to do something new. Nevertheless, I always try to do new things, because it is the desirable mind of the human. "	3.5	3.5	3.5

"Although many people consider trying new things as courageous and innovative, I prefer to do what I already do well rather than taking risks. For one reason, failures that are stacked by the choices of trying new things eventually ruin my life. In my second semester in KAIST, I took too many mandatory classes that was dealing with rather new things to me. The low achievements and difficulties on the courseworks depressed me throughout the semester, making me get very poor grades that semester with a lack of my willpower to study. On the other hand, small successes by doing my best work encourages myself to do better. Because of the last exprerience in the college, I began to take classes more on my major. By doing what I do well, I felt more productive and active. That raised my self-esteem, and I was able to put much more effort to the coursework, which should have been a positive feedback. Most people need home; they don't go to adventure all the time.  The home for them is doing their best jobs."	3	3	3

And there are factor which can show person like changes. Mostly, P likes doing somthing new, but J doesn't like. I am INFP and most INFP like changes. But I prefer to do what I already do well. 

First, change is uncomfortable. I feel happy and comfortable when my life has certain routine. For example, when I sustained my life with some routine like waking up 7:30, doing morning routine, doing exercise and sleeping at 12:00, I not only feel that was the best days in my life but also work better and other times. 

Second, I already spended to much time for changing and doing new things and I found my best through these tries. For example, I changed my major to chemistry, business and finally I join in computer science for more than two years. So these days, doing new things is not useful and time consuming to me. 

Third, I have lower energy than other people. So, I'm tired when I tried new things. For example, when I was 19, I enjoy to go other places or try new challenges. But today, I feel tired early when I do some thing and sleeping or watching ott is more comfortable and happy to me.

In conclusion, I prefer to do what I already do well these days because I don't enjoy changes, I already try new things enough and I have lower energy. But if i find some interesting point which can change my personality or I have enough energy to live, I will change to do new things."	3.5	3	3

"I prefer to try new things and take risks rather than doing only the things that I am already good at. There are two reasons; physical and psychological. First, doing new things makes neurons in brain excited which cause the improvement in brain abilities like memorizing ability or creativity. I've heard about the brain ability improvement of the taxi drivers in comparison to that of the bus drivers. The more various routes they drive, the more improved their memorizing ability is. In the same sense, trying new things will improve my brain ability which will be concluded in my well-being life after long time. Second, when I try new things, there's less psychological burden to end it up in perfect performance. It's easy to care about the mental status if there's no pressure to success. Though the pressure is sometimes helpful to make good result, I usually feel heavy pressure to make best outcome when I do the things I'm already good at, which makes the lower performance and even failure at the end. About four years ago, when I was preparing the university entrance test, I was over-pressed. The stress from this pressure caused bad health condition with headaches, flues and other stress-caused diseases. From this experience, now, I want to avoid the pressure and pressure-causing situation which makes me prefer the new things rather than the thing that I already do well. "	3	3	3.5

Some say that family is the most important influence on young adults. However, Some say that friends are the most important influence on young adults. In my opinion, friends are the most important influence on young adults because of the several reasons.
     First of all, playing with friends is the main influence.  most people play a game of sports lot of time with friends this give a lot of chance to affects young adults. For example, while play with friends, easily talk about lot of topics then easily achieve the opinion from friends.
     In addition to number of friend, age is also a reason.  Friends have similar ages, so they can easily understand about similar ages topic, can feel the same way with sad or funny situation and can talk about their inner thoughts. For example, when drink with parents, sons and dauthers must be careful and really hard to talk about inner thoughts, but drink with friends, they do not need to be careful and easy to talk about inner thoughts.
     Some argue that lived time with adult is more than friend so influence of the family is more important. Although lived with family is more than friend,  talking time with friend is much more than family after being adult. Therefore, Friends affect more than family.  
     To sum up, friends affect most on young adults because of the multiple reasons. playing with friends, age, and length of talking time is the reasons. Even friend is most important factor of influence, family is also important. young adult can learn etiquette.to family, so learn to parent is also important. Therefore, young adults have to focus on both parents and friends"	4	4	4

Humans are influenced by the people around him and his personality are completed. In order for human beings to be complete as social human beings, their parents' care is necessary during the childhood period, and the process of socialization with friends during adolescence is also required. The classification of people that people meet is divided into various categories such as family, co-workers, friends, and lovers. In my opinion, young adults are most influenced by friends for several reasons.
First of all, young adults spend the most time with friends. Young adults are the more time you spend with your friends. In particular, the majority of young adults in Korea go to college and spend the most time with friends they meet in the process. Young adults are often attached to their families during adolescence, but in their twenties, it is not easy to be with them. Young people and their friends are together in the dormitory, taking classes, and traveling together. Spending the most time together suggests that many effects will accumulate.
In addition, young adults are more affected by the actions and words of people of a similar age. Friends' words and actions resemble those of friends who are of the same age and environment as themselves. People have less resistance to accepting their behavior patterns the more they resemble them. Since there is a high probability that they have similar thoughts and a high probability that young adults will naturally accept the emotional and physical behavior patterns that arise in the process of talking with friends. Even the fashion factor encourages friends to sympathize.
Some argue that family influences young people more than friends.  In other words, it is argued that the families of young adults understand them better and can be good conversational partners. However, a study found that young people in their early 20s had the lowest dependence on family. In particular, due to the generation gap with their parents, it is difficult to see them as good conversation partners. A friend who grew up in a similar environment at the same time may be a better conversation partner.
To sum up, young people spend most of their 20s with their friends and do not hesitate to accept their behavior. Young people will inevitably be influenced by their friends. Young people talk with their friends about politics, habits, play styles, utopias, and jobs, and change their values every moment."	4	4	4

Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"Young adult period is important because it affects to the whole lifetime. Some say that friends are the most important influence on young adults. In my opinion, family is the most important influence on young adults.

First of all, young adults take so many time with family, but friends do not. Young adults always play with friends in school or after school. However, they must go their home because they have to eat dinner, and have to take a shower, and have to sleep. Young adults must take time with family if they want or not; therefore, young adults affect by their family naturally.

In addition, the relationship between young adults and their friends is affected by home education. Young adults took a time with family since they were a baby. Therefore, family taught a lot of information about living a life; For example, how to eat a meal or how to talk with friends. Young adults also learned various skills for the good relationship, and young adults uses their skills to their friends. Therefore, Young adults are affected by family, not their friends.

Some argue that young adults want to take more time with their friends because family burden young adults for getting good grades, and give stress. However, it is the problem in some family. Good family does not burden young adults and gives a right way to be a good person.

To sum up, family is the most important influence on young adults. Family takes so many time with young adults, and affects the relationship between young adults and their friends by home education. In young adult period, take more time with family and it gives better relationship with others."	4	3.5	3.5

     When growing up, friends are the closest persons that give to and take influence each other. They share a lot of influence during growing up. Having good friends are important for several reasons.
     First of all, Young children spend a lot of their time with friends. They spend most of their time with family; however, they spend more time with friends in total time, not count in each person. Since they give influence all day, It would be stronger than other relationships.
     In addition, Young people follow the behavior that friends have. A good person has good friends while a bad person has bad friends. People are being similar to close people. It is more effective at a younger age; because, they didn't have strict taste and frequently just follow what their friends do.
      Some say that family is the most important origin of influence on growing up. Family is the closest person; therefore, family influence is stronger than others. However, the closest relation didn't mean the most powerful influence. Family is always the same, while friends are changed; therefore, they receive various influences from friends. Also, young people follow friends rather than family.
     To sum up, Friends are the most important people at a young age. They spend a lot of time with friends and follow the behavior that friends have. Also, they receive various influences from friends. If you have young children, you should teach them about the importance of friends."	4	3.5	3.5

 People encounter various people throughout the entire life and their thoughts and beliefs are established based on the interaction with other people. The most important people among them are families and friends. Many argues that family has the most important influence on young adults as people spend approximately their whole life with their families. In my opinion, friends have the most important impacts on young adults for several reasons.
 First of all,  friends have great influence on young adult's personality as many share their colleage life with their friends. Colleage life is one of the most important period for young adults, for many students can spend time with their own will for the first time in their life. During the colleage period, many students can experience new things and friends play a huge role in such experince. They share common hobbies, club activities and classes; therefore, those shared experience carve young adults' personalities.
 In addition to personalilty, young adults can grow their thoughts through the conversation with their friends. Modern society is a society of Internet. Many young adults communicate with their friends by their smartphones; therefore, they can communicate with their friends more frequently than their familiies even though they live with their families. Thus, they share lots of their thought with their friends on various topics and these conversation have great impact on young adult's virtue.
 Some argues that family is the most important influence on young adults as family can give finantial aids to young adults; however, friends can actually give more finantial aids to young adults. There are many forms of finantial aids, and friends can give finantial aids to young adults by the form of giving useful information. For example, many colleages offer scholarship to students, and these information is shared though friends; therefore, young  adults can get information about scholarship through their friends. Moreover, many jobs emphasize the peer review on job hiring processes, and friends can also play a huge role in those peer review processes.
 To sum up, the interaction with friends is the most crucial factors in living life. There are three factors why the interaction with firends is important: personality, conversation, and finantial aids. Many thinks that family is more important than friends and many tends to ignore the importance of friends; however, friends are the most important people in living life."	4.5	4.5	4

The group that mostly influences on others age is fixed; for example, kids are mostly influenced by their parents and adults are mostly influenced by their friends and coworkers, not their parents. However, young adults are equally influenced by both parents and friends. The most important influence on young adults are their friends for several reasons.
First of all, young adults tend to not need their parent's advice. They are hope to live proactively. They concentrate on what their mind wants, and they want to think alone within their own reason. Young adults more listen to their friend's advice because they think their friends can feel same way. One friend's advice can be a comfort to young adults.
In addition to their willing to live proactively, depending on who the friend young adults have relation with, their life become entirely different. In this period, young adults want to act like adults because they think they are same with real adults. Therefore, young adults are likely to choose wrong choice. They can start to smoke, and have a baby without marriage or any kind of responsibility. If they meet good friend, they become good, and if they meet bad friend, they are easily become bad.
Some argue that the first place where people learn the rule of society is house. However, they will leave that house in the near future. They will have a lot of time with their coworkers, higher worker and their spouse. A relation in house and in school are different, so they have to accustom to their changed society.
To sum up, the most important influence on young adults are their friends. There are three reasons: their property to have independence from their parents, becoming like friends who they met and their changed relations in the future. The friends who young adults met in these ages can become friends that they met forever, and young adults can learn a wisdom of life and relationship from their friends."	4	3.5	3.5

It is not wrong to say that ability in society depends on how they spend their time of young adult period. During this time, various factors of surrounding environment affect people strongly. Some argue that friends have the strongest influence, but in my opinion, the family affects people the most.
     First of all, the money that young adults spend are from their parents. Although young adults are old enough to make their own money, but most of them still receive pocket money. Since the money is from their parents, it is inevitable to avoid interrupts of parrents while spending money. The way of spending money influence young adults a lot; for example, they will travle where there parents want them to go.
     In addition to source of money, opinion of family has strong influence on important decisions of young adults. While opposite opinions of friends are only remain in advise, one of family can even force them to change their mind. Not only for opposite opinions, but also conversations with family in usual time affects a lot. They make decisions in direction of what their family want because, unconsciously, they do not want to against their parents without serious reason.
     Some say friends influence more than family in terms of spending time with. However, it is not a fact that spending more time means influence more. When young adults spending with their family, they remove all of their psycological guards. In other worlds, they become truly themselves only at home. Without those guards, conversations and behaviors are easily affect their habits. 
     To sum up, family is the biggest factor that give huge influences to young adults. Parents interrupt on spending money,  influence to significant decisions, and affect their habits directly. Some parents complane that bad friends affect their children. However, they should realize that family is stronger factors which control the personality of their children and do their best to make atmosphere of familiy happy."	4	4	4

Although some argue that the family is the most important influence on young adults, in my opinion, friends are most important influence on young adults. Influence of friends on young adults are important for several reasons.
     First of all, time to spend with friends are very long. Usually, young adults hang out with their friends during most of days. While family of young adults such as parents and siblings are working, they talk together and spend more time. During this time, young people sometimes do a bad things that they parents do not want. Furthermore, young adults make secret with their friends and do not announce to their family.
     In addition, similar age are one of important factors. Friend with similar ages have similar interests. For example, young adults in same generation follow the same trend; therefore, young adults have a similar fashion style because they influence to each other. 
     Some claim that influence of family is more important than friends because young adults admire their family; however, difference caused by different generation make distance between young adults and their family. Young adults and their family do not interested in same things; therefore, young adults talk with their friends instead of their family.
     To sum up, friends give most important effect on young adults. Three kinds of reason for important influence of friends are spending long time, similar age, and same generation. Because of influence of friends, making good friends are important."	4	4	4

     Throughout history, work-week has been shortened from 7 days to 5 days. Even in a day, employers have reduced working hours to 8-9 hours. With this shortened schedule, there are two types of workers. Some say getting up early and finish early in the evening is better while others say getting up later and working until late at night is better. In my opinion, getting up early has several benefits. 
     First of all, schedule of society is fixed to day workers. In school, students must attend at 9 a.m, so waking up late is impossible. Likewise, company usually fixed their schedule from 9 to 6, so night workers will substituted with day workers if they try to follow their own schedule. Moreover infrastructures such as transportation and shopping stores stop their operation in late night. Night workers cannot use them after finishing work.
     In addition to main schedule of society, getting up early is good for physical health. Usually, night workers skip dinners or eat foods with low nutrition, while day workers eat healthy foods 3 times a day. It makes them healthier. For example, day workers eat at restaurant in company, and night workers eat foods from delivery stores.
     Some argue that there are night workers who are suitable for getting up late, for it makes them more productive. Although companies like start-ups shift their work hours to match the individual life rhythm, this new phenomenon is not widely adapted yet. Before this culture is settled, day workers will have high productivity than night workers who work in companies which have usual fixed schedule.
     To sum up, day workers have several advantages. They matched with main schedule of society which is 9 to 6, and have healthy foods. Despite of efforts to free the individual schedule, it is not widely spread. Until working hours become elastic, getting up early is better strategy than night working."	4.5	4.5	4.5

Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"Some say the family influence a lot on young adults, although others say friends are the most important existence for young adults. In my opinion, Young adults get more influence by their friends for several reasons. 
First of all, they spend most of their time with their friends, so they get a lot of influence from their friends. Many young adults usually go to the university, and they meet their friends and take classes with them. In class, students should often do their group homework; thus, they must hang out with their classmates whether they want or not. Also, to get their job, young adults have to prepare their portfolios, and the general method for making their careers is to join clubs or out-bound activities. 
In addition to spending a lot of time, sharing similar cultures makes them affect each other a lot. People with similar ages remember similar memories even though they lived in different places. They watched similar TV programs and studied in same educational system while they were young. This makes them feel much more friendly and share the same emotions. 
Some argue that still many young adults have no ability to earn money, and their parents give money. Thus, the most influential to them must be their parents, but money cannot restrict people's behaviors and thoughts. They can refer to their parents' words, but finally, they will do how they want because they are not boys or girls anymore. Rather, influencing in enforcement makes young adults to refuse their parents' advice. Moreover, if they think that their parents interrupt too much in their lives, they will be able to try to live alone without their parents' help.
To sum up, adults who are still young get lots of affection from their friends because most of their time is spent with their friends, and they share similar cultures; and even money cannot limit young adults' behaviors and thoughts as longer. "	4	4	4

Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"A person is influenced from his or her family and friends for whole life. For young adults,  these two factors can drive them into various directions when they become university students or get their jobs; thus, it is important to get good relationship with family and friends for young adults. Some argue that family is the most important influence on young adults because of time of living together is the longest. On the other hand, others argue that friends is the most important because friends are in his or her work place. In my opinion, friends are the most important on young adults in three reasons.
     First of all, a young adult can share his or her emotion to friends. A person and his or her friends are in artificially created relationship. They have similar interests and can share with each other; for example, it is hard to share issue about games with family because parents may not want to him or her to play games. However, he or she can share the same issue with friends well. 
     In addition to sharing emotion, friends play a bigger role than family in terms of career. A person usually works or studies with his or her friends. They can grow their knowledge and experience by sharing information and helping each other. A person can improve his or her ability for career with his or her colleague; for instance, some people with big success are helped from their friends.
     Some argue that family and home can provide relaxation and friends can not do this. However, friends also can do this role. A person can get relaxation by sharing concern or play something with friends. One good example is girl friend or boy friend. A person can be relaxed with those specific friends.
     To sum up, for young adults, friends is the most influence because they can share emotion, co-operate, and provide relaxation. When young adults become old and make their family, family may be the most influence; however, at least for young adults, friends still be the most influence. That's why young want to make many friends."	4.5	4	4

            People have different preferences when it comes to choosing the time to work. Some say getting up early and starting the day's work as soon as possible is better since it will make work end early and have free time in the afternoon. Others say it is better to get up later in the day and work until late night because it is more efficient for them to work at afternoon and night. In my opinion, waking up earlier in the day and starting day's work early is better for several reasons.
            First of all, starting work earlier can give free afternoon time after work has ended. Since work hour for a day is normally fixed, starting early means ending earlier; for example, starting work 1 hour earlier will make work end 1 hour earlier. By ending work before dinner will allow on to have free time doing variety of activities that can only be done at daytime such as having time with friends or family, playing some sports, and playing instruments. These kind of activities can only be done at daytime, and early ending of work will let one enjoy these after work.
            In addition to having free time, waking up earlier will make life routine more stable and avoid unhealthy lifestyle. There are many obstacles to getting up early and start work from then such as playing video games until too late or drinking alcoholic drinks too much. In order to wake up early, one will try to avoid these kind of activities that makes getting up in the morning harder. Also, people will try to get to sleep earlier through exercising, listening to calm music, and meditation. All of the things I listed above will help a person build healthier lifestyle that will contribute to happy and healthy life. 
            Some argue that starting work early will harm the performance at work since they are not performant at morning. Although it might be the case, the reason most people are not performant in morning is not because they woke up earlier, but because they slept late. It is known that humans should take average 8 hours of sleep per day and after having enough sleep, they are ready to start their work fully charged. Therefore, if one sleeps early enough to have 8 hours of sleep, performance in the morning would not be harmed. People should not blame the morning for performance; they should blame their late sleep time.
            To sum up, the lifestyle of waking up early and starting work morning will make life much enjoyable and healthy in multiple ways. It will offer free time when sun is still up, allowing many activities that can be done at day. Also, while trying to get up earlier, lifestyle will get healthier and stable by avoiding obstacles for getting up early."	4.5	4.5	4.5

    People usually introduce themselves with clarifying that they are the morning-like people or night-like people. Likewise, getting up early or getting up lately is one of the popular controversies among people in daily life. Although some say that getting up later and work until late at night is preferable, in my opinion wake up early in the morning is better for several reasons.
     First of all, waking up early is good for our health. Each country, they made a time with regards to rising time of Sun and falling time of  Sun. In other words, waking up early means do the work during the sun is over the ground and sleep when the outside is dark. People have to see the sun to make vitamin-D; furthermore, this ingredient has important roles in human health. Also, sleep at night is more efficient because people usually sleep well in the dark; as a result, those who work until late might have serious health issue.
     In addition, most of the world start at morning. For example, school , company, market, and restaurant starts at 8-9 A.M. To live a usual daily life, people should follow with this situation; otherwise, they cannot eat what they want and they cannot see who they want to see well. Follow with majorities' activity time is important.
     Some argue that working at night is more efficient to work. They argue that it is more quiet and easy to concentrate to work at night; however, this quiet means there are not many people who work at that time. Nowadays, there are lots of work to cooperate with other team members; therefore, it is not efficient because they cannot interact with other team members easily.
     To sum up,  waking up early at the morning is more preferable because of health and most of the world start at morning. Also, the argument that working at night is efficient is not true. There are no in-born personality that clarifies morning-like people and night-like people; therefore, just keep trying to wake up early and sleep early at night. By doing so, people can be more healthy and work well. "	4.5	4	4

At the same time, young adult is the first time to take responsibility about their behaviors. Some say that the family is most important influence in this reason; however, friends have various, strong influence on young adults due to similar age and sharing time.
First of all, friends have strong influence to young adults because of similar age group. Young adults have a lot of time in the school; therefore, most of the friends are schoolmates. It is obvious that schoolmates have similar ages. Humans in similar age group mostly feel and act in the same way, thus they share more feelings than in different age group. It indicates that young adults are affected by friends due to similar age group.
In addition to similar ages, friends are the most important influence on young adults, since they share most of time. Most of young adults hang out with their friends. Moreover, young adults meet friends often in the school. As shared time between humans increase, the impacts to each other also increase; hence, friends mostly affect to young adults. 
Some argue that family is more important influence than friends, because young adults live with their family in most of their life. However, rather family has lower effect to young adults because of that, paradoxically. Since young adults live with their family, the impact of the family converges gradually. On the other hand, the influence of friends varies in positive direction. Most of young adults make their friends and break the relationship in repeatedly. This start and end of relationship with friends have stronger influence than family. 
To sum up, young adults are mostly affected by friends since they have similar ages and share time. They share more feelings with their friends in most of free time. It cannot be denied that friends are one of the most important, valuable to young adults."	4	4	4

	Aristotle said that human is a social animal. Social activities are especially more important for the young adults, as they are learning about their relationships. Some say that friends are the most important factor that affects the young adults, but others say that the biggest factor affecting them is family. Friends influences the most on young adults for several reasons.
First, young adults usually spend more time with their friends than with their family. Young adults meet their colleagues and friends by going to college or workplaces. By spending more time and doing more activities with friends, young adults become more influenced by colleges. They also begin to live independently, so it is natural to keep distance with their family.
In addition to spending more time with friends, there is more control over the relationships between friends. Family members are not selected, but young adults can select who will become their friends. If there is a big mistake between friends, they sometimes end their relationship and never see them again. By these interactions, they learn how to begin or end relationships, which cannot be learned through family.
Lastly, some argue that giving advices throughout life can only be done within family; however, friends can also give advices. Wisdom is given not through the long lifetime, but through the special experience and insights. The friends may have similar age, but they can have more wisdom than parents over certain topics. When choosing jobs, for example, a friend may give better advices by information of recent changes in the industry collected working as an intern.
To sum up, friends are the most influence on young adults, because they spend long time with friends and they have more control over the relationship. Despite the argument that life-long advices can only be given by family, friends can also give advices."	4.5	4	4.5

"The influence on young adults by family and friends changes their life, but who are the most important influence is an argumentative issue. Some say the family is the most important influence on young adults. However, in my opinion, the friends affect young adults more than the family does.
     First of all, young adults learn behaviors from their friends. They usually weigh belonging to a group of friends as the most important thing, and the behaviors of young adults in a group are similar to each of themselves. Some students in a bad circle, for example, learn cigarettes or alcohols from their friends, and even addicted to the things, while other students in a polite friend group improve their manner and get a high grade in their school. They copy the behavior of the group members to stay in the group, for the uniqueness is the major cause of bullying. As a result, the properties of young adults become similar to those of their friends.
     In addition to peer learning, the friends are the major cause of events.  Young adults usually spend their time with their friends, and almost all good or bad happenings occur during this time. For instance, friends can fight with each other, or some friends get injured by an accident. How to deal with those situations makes them stronger. The more events, the more experience of dealing with problems.
     Some argue that the family affects young adults more because the family consists of people who raised them, or grew up with them. However, it is not always true that raising or growing up with them affects the young adults. In fact, how the relationship is the more significant thing.
     To sum up, the friends have the most important influence on young adults. They learn from their peers, and getting through events with friends makes them mature. Look back their friends to know who they are."	4	4	4

And I was also afraid to failure that came from what I tried new things and couldn't success. But I had a question about it. If I keep going to do only what I already do well, is it helpful for my growth?
 My answer is 'no'. I think trying new things is what we have to do. When we do new things and success well, we can feel much achievement. This will be a large courage for us to participate another new thing.
 The risk also can be an obstacle to start a new thing. We need to handle the risks from new things. We also have to practice how to solve the risk when we meet it. Then, the risk won't be a problem when you participate something you don't know well.
 We can see the proof in history that trying new things give us development. The human keep developed to try new things in historical sight. The human used natural things first such as stones, branches. And someone used steels that they hadn't used before. Using steels was gave a largest development for the human.

Because learning something new is more energy consumption, and doing what we already doing well makes us feel comfortable and could be more challenging. 
 First, learning something new is more energy consumption. Imagine the situations that we try to do something new like playing the piano. We are not familiar with playing the piano, so we are nervous about how other people hear the playing for the first time. Also, there are a lot of new things that we have to learn for playing the piano well. Doing something new needs more attention to learning, and We think about other people's views. It is mentally stressful to us and more energy consumption.  
 Second, doing what we already doing well makes us feel comfortable and could be more challenging. We already know what kinds of things that we can do better. The things that we can do better than other people make us feel better. Because most of the people compare their abilities to other people. When they do better than other people, then they feel better and comfortable. Also, there will be more time and hard to do better one thing that already doing well than doing many things not deeply. In this case, doing what we already doing well could be more challenging.

But I prefer to try new things and take risks for two reasons. First, I can experience new things and challenging moment will give a lot of fun.
First of all, trying to do what I’ve never done will give me new experiences and make my view more widely. Doing familiar things is easy and can be improve certain skills, but they could not experience other things. Every people have different talent. In the world, there are uncountable jobs. If doing only what they good at, they could not get a chance to find they’re natural talent. Even for me, I found my new talent to trying to do new things. When I was in elementary school, I was good at solving math problems. I like to solve problems even at physical activity class. Someday I participated running, and physical teacher say’s I’m really good at running. I can find my new talent to trying to experience new things. So trying to do unfamiliar things give new experience and help to find new gift.
Second, trying to learn new things maybe challenging and hard to become at good. But people can improve themselves in this challenging moment. People have to learn step by step to become good at new things, and also need a lot of effort. Sometimes people fail to learn new things. In this case, it seems like time wasteful. But even if failure, there are a lot of things that people could learn in the progress. People can learn what is the problem in this new challenge. Based on the previous challenge, people can try new things better on next time. Also, people can know the way to learn new things. "	3	2.5	2.5

Third, whenever I try to do new things, the result was not good. Whenever I try new foods, try new games, try competitive subjects, or try new life style, I feel uncomfortable and I experience failure, and usually comeback to what I tend to do.
I know that sometimes, risk is unavoidable and I have to take it. When that time comes, I try to search for it and prepare for it as much as possible. I don't want to meet ""uncomputable"" situation.

As many people like to do only what they already do well, I also prefer that than to try new things and take risks. When I entered our university first, I prefer to try new things and take risks. Therefore, I do many things that I've never done before. However, as time goes on, I prefer to do what I already do well. There are many reasons to change my mind.
 First, the fear from new things makes me to feel anxiety. A long time ago, I have many interests for doing somethings new. To visit the new places, to meet new people and get friendships are my favorite hobby. Also my superior is sociable. However, as time goes on, I understand that all of the people can't be my friends. Some people may like me. Also some people can hate me. As I meet many relationships between many people, I feel comfortable to my old friends. I don't need to care their needs because it is very natural to our relationship. This tendency makes me to get some reluctance from new things. If I do what I already do well, I don't need to feel anxiety and fear to do it.
 Second, mistakes from the newness make me to feel atrophy. Most of people can't do the best when they do something first time. Also they can make some mistakes during they do something new. I tend to get lots of stress from making the mistake. I also have the perfectionist tendence for doing some works. Even if not like me, many people get some stress from making the mistake. Most of people may feel comfortable to do something that they already do well. It's because the probability is very small to make mistakes during they do something that they already do well. This reason can cause many people to feel calm and to do the work better.
 People who always try are beautiful. However, I think taking care of myself is also very important to challenge many things to do in the future. Also it is very important to know the tendency of himself. I know my tendency that to get much stress from doing mistakes. So, I've changed that I prefer to do only what they already do well."	3	3	3

Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion."	"I prefer to try new things and take risks. Doing new things is my pleasure.
First reason why I prefer doing new things is fun from overcoming challenge. I love to overcome challenges. For example, last semester, I made a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) with only one rotor. It is very challenging, because all other typical UAV has 4 rotors and almost every UAV has more than 2 rotors. It was very hard, but when I finished making, it gives me huge pleasure.
Second reason is wisdom from tries. To do new things, we need many tries, and almost every try will be fail. But fail is expensive experience we should have. Because we can learn many things from fails. Think about process of learn how to ride a bike. First we ride 3-wheeled bike, and than we move to usual bike with 2 additional support wheel. Finally, we detach the support wheel and tries to ride bike with our own balancing sense. But everybody will get hurts on this process. But eventually we can ride bike with any accident and get wells on it. Because many fails give wisdom to we. So, doing new things can make us smarter and wiser.
And their are many minor reasons; chances to meet new people, gives me more income, no emotional pressure that I must success, etc. 
These are why I prefer to try new things. Do what they already do well is also important, but we should not stop do new things to go further our society."	2.5	2.5	3

I would not say to focus on things they are good at is wrong. It is safe way to achieve a goal. But there is some comparative merits to try new approach. 

The main merit is that flexible approach help to adapt in various situation.  As world changes faster and faster as times going on, flexible mindset becomes crucial. Let me give you a example. In the field of biology, major method to research a protein was chemical experiments. But in these day, AI arise really important tools to predict protien structures and reaction. Papers publishing in main journals are mainly using computers. If a scientist refuse to learn computers, he will be forgotten in the field. Similar change of fields is happens everywhere. We should always prepare for a change of world.

One may worried about risk. Even though wolrd is change, how could we possibly know that the new approach will be more suitable for the new environment. Answer is we can't. We can't be 100% sure about new technique. Sometimes or maybe most of times new challenge gives you worse result than previous answer. But however we can learn something from that fails. We can learn how to minimize the risk, distinguish the gold and the stone. We can get a new insight from that failure. The most important thing is that every choice has a risks. Stick to a thing that we are already do well has also a risks. But we can learn more when we try a new thing. 

To sum up, try unfamiliar things has advantage in adapt on varying world, and utilize the risk. That's why I prefer to try new things instead of familiar things."	2.5	2.5	3.5

First, most of people thinks that they can do very well something. But actually they must have weak points to do that. What i talking about is there are no limit to perfect performance. There must be another risk and weak point. So, If someone said that ""i already do it well"" . but there must be more points to be improve. 

Second, if you do somethings that already do well, you can get more energy and confidence by doing that. This energy and confidence can make high self esteem. This is very important points in human being. 

Third, I think that every study, and every sports, even every work is same. Because if you want to make best performance of doing something, you must be have concentration, persistent attitude. if you make best performance of doing something, then, you have ability to make best performance of doing another things.
so, i prefer to do what they already do well."	2.5	2.5	2.5

For a history, many scientists and engineers have broadened the range of science and technology with their infinite passion and effort. If they have satisfied with their previous work, science and technology would not have been developed. Also, let's focus on the Columbus who found the America continent. Columbus, who is famous European explorer, has explored all over the world and found the new continent, America. This experimental spirit influenced to the American culture, which is known as 'Frontier spirit'. They always think and imagine outside of the boundary, and willingly take risks to explore outside of the world. This spirit is worthwhile since it is basement of the development. If we do only what we already do well, there will be no achievement for doing something.
I'm studying Aerospace engineering in KAIST. The person who I admire the most is Elon Musk, who is trying to reach the Mars. For decades ago, many people didn't believe he is going to make it. However, for now, he already got the advanced rocket technology, which could not have been achieved by the national institute of America. I think that the source of his outstanding performance is 'challenging spirit'. He always keep in mind the these spirit, and take risks. He does not afraid of failure.
Like him, I always feel excited and motivated when I imagine the future in which humans freely go to space,  even to Mars. This is the reason why I'm studying Aerospace engineering. This spirit makes me move harder, and have better performance. Sometimes failure can make us disappointed. However, this feeling makes us stronger. We can overcome and get through these feelings, with the better performance and motivation. 
'Challenging spirit' is a natural spirit that all the human beings potentially keep in mind. We have developed and will develop based on these spirit. In this point of view, I prefer to try new things and take risks."	2.5	2.5	3

In such sea, we always face to our new things, which is difficult and complex to solve or clear. However, just this behaviors are meaningful. we can learn many experience from it. From this experience, we would get  to help coming challenges in our life as footprint. I think this experience to personal history. Second, it is meaningless that do only what they already do well. Do you know ""Wexler's self achievement  desire""? He divide it into 5 levels. It means human beings  always wants to more self achievement  rather than basic desire for survive, such as sleep, feed and relieve. Therefore, Trying new things can bring us more confidence and filling achievement desire.  This positive effects are keep working and get positive feedback so, reinforce that effects.  Last, Human beings are flexible.  Since human beings start, they always have try new things no matter what risky and filled with curiousity. This attitude towards to new things is main source how to people achieve the best species in Earth. If there is no such attitude, we would be cut off. Therefore, I think that to prefer challenges is natural and genomic programming phenomenon."	3	2.5	3

Since I am not a challenging person or I don't like to endure taking a risk, I wish I could do the things that I'm already good at it for my entire life. Let's assume some person X and Y should make a DRAM chip. Here, X is a professional engineer and Y has been graduated undergraduate process just 2 months before. Even if Y is quite intelligent and has a good sense to processing a semiconductor, most people might inquire X to make a DRAM chip. It is important to get many experiences, especially in engineering, and I think all the other parts are similar.  Also, X would end up some tasks faster with better quality than Y, in the aspect of the efficiency. It is reliable and taking less risks to select professional one. With these reasons, the companies, researches, institutions prefer the experienced person to the other who is not.
By the improvement of the medical science, however, human beings' average lifetime has been extended. Thus, it is difficult to do only what we do well for our whole life. In future, the related industry or business that we're good at now might be turned out that it doesn't essential or important for our life anymore. Then, we should get a new job and start to stack new experiences from the bottom. As people getting older, it takes a longer time to learn new things than when we were young. Therefore, I think learn many things on various parts are important, such as learning new language, learning how to make a cocktail, learning how to bake, and so on. In conclusion, I hope to do only what I already good at it, but in reality, it is inevitable to try new things and get some risks in my opinion. We should familiar to make a challenge to our life, and need to raise the flexibility to handle the risks when we face to them."	2.5	2.5	4

The first reason is that there is a chance to develop inhanced achivement by repeating what I already do. This is shown clearly when I study some difficult topics such as studying my major subjects. More thinking about them, I often had more developed understanding about them even if some of parts are understood. It is possible only when repeating what I do well. Second, it is hard to know about the level of myself. Some people may say that they do well something, but there is a limitation of their judgements. Because most of them can't have enough experience to compare the level of them and other people. For example, I was one of students who have excellent understading about the highschool mathmetics and sciences in my highshool. However, I realized that there are many students who have better understading about these fields and more difficult subject which I need to study forever. Therefore, doing well is not likely to mean doing well and rather means we need to check it again. The last reason is that trying new things brings some risks. The last reason is that trying new things brings some risks. These risks are related to changing the way I live. I don't want to change many part of my life. "	3	3	3

It is obvious that following the manual is good way because it reduces the risk and show convenient way to solve the problem.
However, despite of the advantages for them, I prefer to try new things and found a new route. There are several reasons for them.
First, we can get more insights for the tasks, during the research to find a new way. We have to make deep understand for the given tasks because trying the new thing starts from finding the strong and weak points for original manual. So, even if we fail to try new method, it is not worthless because our knowledge have been improved. The possibility for success will be grown up, since our ability and skills for tasks has upgraded further.

Second, if we find the new efficient way to solve the tasks, it is good for everyone who are related to this tasks. Maybe the royalty can be given to us by using the new solution or manual.

Third, which is the most important part in my opinion is, we can get rid of the fears that is from something unknown. Therefore, we can make challenges  for other tasks, or make deeper research for previous things. This development shows how the technologies of humanity develop.

Thus, referred from the reasons above, I think that taking the new way is better than following the protocol."	3	3.5	3.5

First, I can find what I like and do well. There are many people who do not know what they like and do well. For example, I didn't know that I would major the Computer Science. I don't know anything about this major. However, when I was in high school, I tried listening to computer classes and I found that I'm good at these classes. Like this, people can find what they do well from trying new things. On the other hand, there will be no change for the people who do only what they already do well.
Second, I can grow up from the experiences. Like the sentence, that is, the failure is mother of the success, the failure is not only the bad thing. people can make better performances from the experience of failure. For example, I like to try singing new songs when I go to the singing room. Then, there are many songs which I don't know well or I can't sing well of course. My emotion is not good at those moments. However, I can get the experience and know what I don't know or what I can't sing. Also I can practice the songs which I want. Consequently, I can grow up and the number of songs which I can sing becomes increases more and more.
For these reasons, I like to try new things continuously. I feel that I can become a better person from trying new things."	2.5	3	2.5

Some people cure other people or animals, some people play the soccer, some people play the instruments, some people make machines or computers, some play the games. Such various and many things in the world, some people like to do only what they already do well, and others prefer to try new things although they have to take risks.
 In my case, I prefer to try new things and take risks. 
 Trying new things, I can learn them, and can feel fresh fun. I can feel fresh feeling like eating tomato salad although I have to take some risks. For example, I enjoy playing the piano in the left time. Playing a song that I already do well is fun because I can express the feeling of that song well, however, playing a song that I first met is also fun because I can feel and express new various sounds and feelings of the song. Although I sometimes push wrong keys of piano and I feel tired when I see very complex piano notes, that hardness and my mistakes give me more passion to practice, and I can feel big happiness when I met harmony of sounds I did not expect. For another example, I also enjoy playing the game in the left time. I prefer not to play just one or two characters and positions but play various game characters and positions. Though I make mistakes and lose in some games when I play new character, learning skills and moving of that character through practice is fun. Also, I feel more excited when I carry some games. For these examples, I can feel fun when I try new things.

We like KAIST's atmosphere: encourages new challenge, and try anything what we want. There are three reasons why I prefer to take risks. 
  First, people who change world have creativity, and we cannot make creativity when we just to do only what already do well. Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos... people who change world do not avoid trying new things. Innovations are not coming routed task. People's awareness are changing to support new challenge, also KAIST. Our school president say, ""Don't be afraid question, trying challenge"". And I like our school's atmosphere, open-class, debate and discussion section.
  Second, we are very young, and we don't be afraid of failure. We can get wisdom by challenge. Experience of trying new thing is very important in our long-lifetime. Also, if we unsuccess try new thing and have risk, we can recover and try again because we are young and we have enough time. I will try new things always if I get chance.
  Last, trying new things make bright energy. Like adventure, trying new things is interesting. Unknown knowledge, people, technology are wait us. Through trying new things, we can find and make friends, who have same interesting area. In my case, I have old-friend in my elementary school. I meet him in science club, and we communicated about our scientific curious and took science experiment in our club room. Now, long time over, We connect when sometimes we remember our childhood or share each idea, knowledge. I feel energetic when saying creativeness with my friend. 
  By these reason, I prefer to try new things and take risks. Doing only what already do well is important, too. It can make higher-level technology. But we can grow ourselves when waste afraid of taking risk and break bored routine. "	2.5	2.5	3

By trying new things, we can get experience and improvement which can be used to try other things. Experts can be outperformed in some area, but they cannot cope with the emergency situation which needs other experience. 
For example, data scientist performs a excellent model to the specific dataset. However, if the dataset is not so clean because of the outlier or missing value, the excellent model gives a bad prediction to the dataset. Then, how can data scientist remove the outlier or missing value? He should learn the domain knowledge. Even though he knows all of the knowledge in data science well, he should know the knowledge beyond the data science.
In conclusion, trying new things can bring experience which can be used to try other new things. When you try other new things, the past experience helps you to do better job."	2	2.5	3

Some argue that the family is the most important influence on young adults While others argue that the friends are the most important influence on young adults. In my opinion, the friends are more important influence on young adults than the family.
First of all, Young adults have less time or relationships with their family compared to teenagers. Many young adults should participate social activities such as universities or jobs; In social activities, they spend many times with their friends. This is why they hate ""mamaboy"",  people who usually tend to follow their family.
In addition, the scope of friends on young adults is much wider than one of families. Young adults have many chances to make friends on their social community; the number of the family members is fixed while the number of friends is increasing more and more. Because of variety of friends, they can get various advices from their friends, not their family; so, they have more chance to be affected from their friends.
Some argues that the family is the most important influence on young adults because they had relationships for a long time. However, they have already adopted their influences when they are not adults, and young adults are not be affected their influences unless their family have changed. Rather, there are more probability to be affected by their new friends who started to meet after becoming adults because it would be new experiences.
To sum up, young adults are affected more by their friends, not their family due to more time to meet, increasing numbers of their friends, and new experiences. "	4.5	4	4

 	People usually get up at morning to work, study and exercise. Getting up early in the morning is not easy to people who work in busy society. However, people are used to start their work in the morning. Getting up early in the morning has advantages for several reasons.
First of all, human can work most efficiently at morning. The human body is designed to work at morning. Brain uses itself actively when wakes up early. Getting up early makes people to keep their schedules and rules. Efficiency of work is important to success life, and it can be completed with getting up early.
In addition to efficient work, getting up early is helpful to people, coworkers, and companies. Almost businesses are done in 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. People should work in that time because they need to work with their coworkers. Companies have the rules about time that employees get to their work place, and it is useful to make more advantages that other companies. 
Although some argue that people should be able to start work when they want, it has disadvantages. If people start their work at night, they could not have enough time for hobby or relax. Starting work at night makes the human body tired, and it can be an obstacle to work on next day. However, getting up early helps that people have time to go gym and do activities. Starting work in the morning can make balance between work and life.
To sum up, getting up in the morning is important to improve efficiency of working. Getting up early can help people work efficiently and make advantages for employees and companies. Also, starting work in the morning makes balance between work and life. Getting up in the morning will help people to success and have their happy lives. "	4	4	4

Setting a pattern when to wake and sleep is important because it determines that the condition of the whole day. When the pattern was changed, the condition of the day might be lowered; therefore, choosing the pattern between getting up early in the morning and later in the day is important. Getting up early in the morning is better than later in the day for several reasons.
First of all, getting up early will protect biorhythm. Before invention of candle and light bulb, human beings had to wake up early in the morning and start the day's work for a million years. Furthermore, the body of human is optimized in getting up in the morning, for the hormone which motivates human body to get up is produced when the sun comes out. Also, as sleep with light in the morning, the fatigue of the body will not be solved; therefore, the body might not be in full-condition.
In addition, getting up early reinforces relationships. Working and playing in the day are common senses around society. There are a lot of stores and coworkers in the day; however, there are a few of stores and coworkers. It is more easy to meet friends or coworkers in the day than in the late night. Getting up early would help to build relationships.
Some argue that the efficiency of work is the most crucial factor; however, when considering dying, the most crucial aspect that everyone should focus on is the health. Eating meals at third times in a day is more easier if someone gets up early in the morning. Exercising in the late night is harder than in the day. These things will affect the health.
To sum up, getting up early in the morning is better than later in the day for several reasons. It protects biorhythm, reinforces relationships, and health. Getting up early should be selected with considering the effects of getting up early."	4.5	4	4.5

     There are many lifestyle among people. Some people get up at early , and some people get up at late at night. In my opinion, getting up early in the morning and start the day's work has several benefits. 
     First of all, living life healthier. Sunlight is essential for human body which make Vitamin D for human body; moreover, there is a research if sunlight is lacking, it could lead to depression. A person who get up early could have enough sunlight during the day time by walking to school, running at part, and laying down at bench, which makes sufficient Vitamin D and prevents depression.
    In addition to live life healthy, Various activities are more available at day time compare with night time ; for example, climing, going swimming pool, and going piano academy. Moreover, many public facilities open at morning until evening. If getting up at early in the morning, the chance and effectiveness are increased that doing various activities and deal with works. 
   Some argue that working at night is more efficient because no one distract at night time; however, it also could be efficient at morning. Miracle morning which is famous in the world is a method that getting up early like 5'o clock  and start day with specific routine. By doing Miracle morning, people can obtain a private time that possible to focus on what they want in the day time.
     To sum up, getting up early and start the day has more benefit than waking up later.  To get up early, the life would become more healthier, possible to do various activities, and have no distraction time from everything. If keeping routine that get up early, it will leads the way how to enjoy the all day. "	4.5	4.5	4

Time is equal to everyone. Anyone can use their time as they want. They can choose when to work or sleep. Some say that they prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day's work. However, in my opinion, getting up later in the day and working until late night has several benefits.
First of all, it is easier to stay awake until late than waking up early. When getting up early, he or she can feel tired all day long, so efficiency goes down. In contrast, it is easier to stay awake until late if he or she uses energy drink.
In addition, people can be more efficient when due is near. In the morning, they feel that there are plenty of time left, so they can postpone their work until afternoon. When they get up later, the due of today's work is close, so they work hard for it. In conclusion, efficiency goes higher when he or she works at night.
Some argue that getting up late means lazy; however, because time is equal to everyone, it is not important to choose to get up late. When you look at the different angle, waking up 4 hours late can mean waking up 20 hours early. The important thing is the amount of time on work, not the timing of it.
To sum up, starting the day later has various advantages. It is easier to stay awake until late than waking up early, and one can be more efficient in the night. Remember, choosing how to use one's time is one's right."	4	4	4

    People experience various success and failures in life. Most people want to succeed in their goals; however, it does not always go the way that they think. Some argue that careful planning causes the success while others argue that success in life comes from taking risks and chances. In my opinion, taking risks is mendatory to success for several reasons.
    First of all, people have limitations in planning. Diverse factors determine the future. For example, a famous restaurant went bankrupt due to COVID 19. To be successful, people have to adapt to the changes in the world. Moreover, the adaption to the changes is important because people can not perfectly predict what will happen at any time.
    In addition to limitations in planning, taking risks is the beginning of the jackpot. For instance, thin potato chips are the result of failure. People who tried it at the time were asked why they made such an attempt, but now their work is a masterpiece. Ture success comes from spirit of challenging. Most masterpieces stem from spirit of challenging.
    Some argue that careful planning causes success without frustration; however, taking risks makes people mentally strong. People grow when they experience something. Although taking risks leads to failure, people can learn a lot from it. All of experiences are helpful when big choices are forced in the future. Achieving good results in such a big choice is the shortcut to success.
    To sum up, taking risks is mendatory to success for aforementioned reasons. Limitations in planning, beginning of the jackpot, and making people mentally strong could be the reasons. Taking risks is not always easy. Sometimes it may make people hard and frustrated. However, if people overcome it, they will face real success."	4.5	4.5	4.5

Every human goes to sleep after finishing their daily works. While sleeping our body regenerate damaged cells and tissues to prepare for the next day. Before inventing electricity, working at nights was bad idea, so almost every people slept after sunset. Now, due to invention of electricity,  peoples can work until late at night with no problem. As a result, people are eventually divided into two groups: wake early and work until before dinner, and wake lately and work until late at night. In my opinion, wake early is better for life cycle for several reasons.
 First of all, wake up early is good for health. Each person has own biorhythm, and it is tuned to work at day and to sleep at night. According to research from doctor Kim, Going bed and sleep early is best way to maintain that biorhythm, or biorhythm can easily breaks (Kim).
 Next, wake up early can increase working efficiency. As doctor Han said, Our brain system work more efficiently under daylight (Han). 
 To Sum up, wake early is better way to achieved healthy life for several reasons. We can maintain our biorhythm and increase working efficiency by waking up early. If going to bed early is hard, try some aroma or teas for relaxing. Let's breath the fresh air of morning together.

People spend about one-third of their life taking sleep. Since no one can live without sleeping, making a healthy schedule to sleep is really important. Awaking in the early morning or late is also important. Some might think it is not a big deal if they awake for the same hours; However, it is not true. As the proverb said, ""Early birds catch a bug."" Starting the day in the early morning gives healthier life in several aspects.

First of all, being awake in the morning gives time for alone. Even the extrovert person needs time alone from time to time. Time for self-observation, refreshing, and meditation might be needed, but it is hard to get time alone after entering society. Taking extra time in the early morning would be a good alternative for it. Many people are satisfied with the efficiency of the activity in the morning. Typically, activity in the morning shows more efficiency than other times, for no other distracting thoughts get started.

In addition, sleeping earlier help to avoid wasting time at night. Most peoples use their time in the evening to refresh and chill. People get stressed and tired from their work in the daytime. They do not have tolerance left for doing productive things at night, so reducing the time from commute to sleep would help avoid waste of time. If the waste of time includes using mobile phones or other electronic devices, it is worse because these activities interrupt the deep sleep at night. 

Finally, someone might think some people might get extra focused late at night; however, it is not true. The time to start sleeping is important in the condition of overall days. Scientist shows that sleeping from 11 PM to 1 AM gives extra benefits due to the biological cycle. As sunlight affects the biological cycle greatly, everyone shows a similar biological cycle. Strengthening the memory and restoring willpower, the representative function of sleep shows more efficiency from 11 PM to 1 AM. Hence, try to sleep before 11 PM.

To sum up, a habit of waking up early has benefits on having time for oneself, avoiding wasting time due to stress they had, and getting extra benefits of sleep. Even though it looks hard to wake early, it is easier than it looks. Wake at the same time is the best way to set a biological rhythm. Also, it would be helpful to know that many people wake up late in their adolescents but wake up earlier and earlier as they get older. Awake the morning and live a productive life. "	4.5	4	4

 There are many pros and cons whether faster pace or slower pace. Although Everyone prefer different pace, once you make it habit, it is not easy to fix it. In my opinion, slower pace is more efficient for several reasons.
 First of all, person who has slower pace attitude can make work perfect. They know that their attitude needs more time to prepare. Therefore, they starts earlier than others and prepares in advance, so it is highly completed perfect.
 In addition, person who has slower pace has lower probability to make a mistake. They have much time to do works, so it can be more completed outcomes.
 Lastly, some argue that person who has faster pace can makes more outcomes than slower pace person. However, it seems like doing more at the beginning, but they will end up making mistakes and spending more time to fix it.
 Person who has slower pace can make work more perfect, has lower probability to make a mistake, and save more time than person who has faster pace. In this reasons, person who has slower pace can make outcomes perfectly. The reason why slow-going turtles can go farther than fast-going rabbits is that they are not tired and can look closely one by one."	4	3.5	3.5

Life cycle is the important part of our life. Based on the characteristic of individuals, some people prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day's work, on the other hand, some people prefer to get up later in the day and work until late at night. Although many people insist that getting up late is better, getting up early in the morning and start the day's work, that can face a morning with energy and freshness is beneficial with several reasons.
First of all, the sunlight gives energy in daily life. Sun rises at about 6 A.M. in the morning, and get dark at about 6 P.M. Human's life-cycle is based on the sun rise rhythm; therefore, matching the rhythms with sun rise will give more energy in daily life. Also, according to the research of bio-scientist Kang, sunlight contains a lot of vitamins, as well as other helpful operations.
In addition, it is important to spend more time with family. The social norms usually make us work at the day-time, and get rest when it gets dark. Schools, companies, and other social infrastructures follow this rule for the uniformity of society. Getting up early in the morning and start the day's work can be naturally harmonized with these social flows; however, getting up late in the day makes it difficult to interact with others. 
Some argue that getting up late is beneficial because it ensures the enough time to rest. However, these enough times to rest is not only given to whom get up late. Getting up early, and finishing the given tasks early can ensure the enough time to rest too. Since it is possible to spend time with family, more enjoyable leisure time can be given when get up early in the morning.
To sum up, starting the day early have various benefits. The sunlight gives more energy in daily life, and, it ensures the precious time with family. All the individuals have their own lifestyles. It can be hard to someone to get up early in the morning. However, more energetic, fresh day is waiting to whom get up early. Again, getting up early in the morning will bring positive effects to life, as well as society."	4.5	4	4.5

In early morning,  bright sounds of bird and sunlight are waken people. Many people have experienced clear and cool feeling. The sun rises in the morning and falls in the evening, and it is rightful. Like the sun, many people wake up in the morning and sleep at night. There are three reasons why getting up early in morning is beneficial; health, achievement , and hormones due to sunlight.
First of all, people can be healthy. If people get up early, they can spend time to eat breakfast. Breakfast is very efficient to them; in addition, breakfast gives us force to spend the day.  To get up early makes people to sleep early, so enough sleep time is  guaranteed. From this effects, face skins are clear. Moreover, by living with regular routine, people's digestion system becomes stable.
In addition, people  feel achievement.  People get habit  with the regular routine life, so they can live on time. It increases the ability of their tasks, and their tasks become high quality results. It continue positive feedback.  Therefore, people enjoy their life and work.
Some argues that they can concentrate easily at night than during afternoon. However, many research reports that sunlight makes hormones that can concentrate easily. Therefore, there is no reason that work until late at night. Moreover, when people get up later in day, they feel sleepy for a long time. To wake mental completely, they should spend enough time. 
To sum up,  there are three advantage when get up early constantly due to being healthy, feeling achievement, and hormones. If eople follow to get up early, they become better person. "	4	4	4

There are various types of people in the world and each of lifestyles is also different. The lifestyle is affected by what the career is. Some prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day's work, while others prefer to get up later in the day and work until late at night. In my opinion, working on the daytime has several benefits.
First of all, human body's biological rhythm is focused on the daytimes. Almost every person would experience it is more tired and exhausted after woke up for the all night, for preparing the exam, doing assignments, etc. This is because the rhythm has broken. Once the rhythm has broken, it is difficult to get back the original pattern, and it may cause the decline of the efficiency of work.
In addition to the biological rhythm, working in the daytime gives more energy. Most of people are woke up in the morning and start to work from the morning to the evening. It can be easily observed that there are lots of busy people doing their job and work for the daytime. Working alone until late at night might be lonely; it may cause depressed feelings.
Some say that working at night is more efficient to focus on working. Some jobs might need the time to concentrate on the creativity such as the musicians, artists, and so on. However, waking up alone until the late at night occurs too many thoughts that do not need to be considered. One thought bites the another thought's tail, and the circulation goes on and on. In this way, it might affect the condition and the atmosphere to the next day in a inappropriate way.
To sum up, get up early and start the day's work is recommended because the bio-system's rhythm has focused on the daytimes and it gives more energy working with other people. Such pattern that gets up late and work until late at night harms the health in the long run since it ruins the biological rhythms. It is much more efficient to work at daytimes. This can be recognized not that difficult if once experienced the difference of the condition between working at daytimes and working at late night."	4.5	4.5	4.5

There are various types of life style, but generally these are separated into earlier one or later one. The selection of life style seems to be a problem of preference. Some argue that getting up later is better. However, starting the day's work early is better choice for several reasons.
First of all, the natural cycle of human body is set to follow the behaivor of the Sun. The Sun releases higher intensity of lights in the moring and lower intensity at night. In addition, human body is controlled by various hormones, which follow the intensity of Sun lights. For example, in the morning, some hormones which help us to get up are secreted, but the artificial lights cannot stimulate the activation of these hormones. Thus, it is natural to get up early in the morning.
Next, the earlier life style is already a standard in most cultures. The society require the life style
Some argue that getting up early is hard, so doing later is better. However, this life style just results from a shift of life cycle. If they try to shift their life cycle to normal one, getting up early is not difficult. Moreover, the less exposure of sun lights can cause health problems such as the shortage of Vitamin D and social problems such as increasing electricity demand.
To sum up, starting a daily life in the moring is essential to improve the level of life. This life style is natural due to the cycle of the Sun and Earth. Furthermore, it is widely selected in many countries. On the other hand, getting up later has various disadvantages to cause a lot of problems."	3.5	4	4.5

Before the electricity had discovered, people had to do their all works at daytime. However, thanks to the advancement of technology, people can do their works anytime they want in nowadays. Some people can start work early in morning and end it at afternoon. Others can start work at evening and end it after midnight. In my opinion, get up later in the day and work until late at night is better way.
First of all, working late at night reduces the variables from relationship between people. Working at daytime makes people feel pressure about their day-by-day task because they have to eat lunch and dinner. Most of appointments are held with dinner, so they have to finish the task before the dinner, if they have an appointment. However, working at night does not have the problem like that. People can easily extend their deadlines to finish their work.
In addition, there are less interruption during the night. Since there are no people surrounding the workers, the workers can concentrate on their works. They can do their work without other useless talks, so the efficiency of work increases. Also, they can take short time break freely, for they do not need to think about other people's sight. It can reduce the stress due to the working.
Some argue that working late at night is not good for health. The arguments says, getting up and sleep lately can increase the probability for cancer. Although the argument is true, working at night is still good way because the argument did not consider about the working time. Since the working efficiency is increased, the required time for work has decreased. It means that person who works at night have more time to rest, compared to the person who works at daytime. So, night-time workers can take care of their health by taking more breaks.
To sum up, getting up later in the day and working at night has advantages because the efficiency of work goes increase. Increased efficiency can eliminate the bad affects from night working using more breaks. Although the choice for time to work is individual's choice, it is better to choose work lately in the night."	4	4	4

Many people have their own time to sleep and get up. There are people who get up early in the morning and get a sleep early. On the other hand, there are also people who get up later and do not sleep until late. Some can think that it is free to choose anyone for each person. However, getting up early in the morning is a better routine for several reasons.
First of all, people who get up early in the morning can do their work in better condition. Because they get up early, they have a time to prepare their work. They can also have a breakfast and start work in healthy condition. On the other hand, people who get up later usually have no time to prepare their work; they have to start their work rapidly.
In addition, starting the day's work early make a free time in the evening. The people who start the day's work early will finish it early too; therefore, they can usually rest or have a time with family and friends in the evening. This time to rest can help them to start the next day too. However, people who start their work late should work until late at night; eventually, they will work until right before they sleep.
Some argue that people have to sleep more in the morning to make a good condition. They say that getting up later is better since they can sleep enough. However, getting up early can help to make a deep sleep. People who get up early in the morning also get asleep early at night. Then they can sleep deeply at night since it is completely dark at their time to sleep. However, people who get up later cannot sleep deeply, for they have to sleep though the sun is up.  As a result, the quality of sleep is better for people who get up early.
To sum up, getting up early in the morning has many benefits. It helps people to work in better condition in the day, and gives a free time in the evening. It also helps to make a deep sleep at night. The people who get up early can make a good day."	4.5	4	4

	To work, workers have to get up and go their office. Get up time is dependent in their jobs. Most of office workers should get up early, but some freelancers can wake up at evening to work in night. If get up time can be changed, getting up early is better to work for several reasons.
	First of all, getting up late and working until late at night is harmful to health. When getting up late, the workers often do not eat breakfast, and they just eat lunch and dinner. As they ate only two meals, they often eat something during the work in midnight. This habitat can break a balance of body and increase a rate of fat. Also, workers cannot feel the sunlight when they wake up late. The sunlight produce vitamin D, which helps to support bones, so the workers' bone become weak. 
	In addition to the health problem, the workers' human relationships can be weaker. Since they work until late at night, workers should have to sleep immediately after working and arriving at home. Also, since they slept too late, they get up late. In these routines, they have less or no time to meet and enjoy hobbies with their old friends and family. Their relationships become limited in just their office. 
	Some argue that working early is hard because getting up early makes workers tired; however, working at midnight is more hard. The workers have not to sleep during the working. However, in the night, hormones that lead to sleep are produced in their bodies, so avoiding sleep become more hard. Also, this makes the quality of the work lacked.
	To sum up, getting up late is harmful to health, it makes workers' human relationships weak, and makes the quality of the work lacked. Workers who get up early can enjoy their free time with twilight. Unfortunately, there are many workers that have to work until late. For the sake of them, company should find appropriate ways."	4	4	4

  Many people feel hard to get up early in the morning and work until late at night. However, according to successful enterpreneur such as businessmen, politicians, and researchers, waking up in the morning is a successful habit. In my opinion, getting up early in the morning and starting the day's work is better than getting up later in the day and work until late at night by several reasons.
  First of all, people can plan their daily routine in morning. Morning is the time to start the day. people who wake up early can organize what needs to be done during the day. Knowing the importance of tasks and planning in which order to process tasks have great merit in daily routine.
  In addition to planning daily routine in morning, people can use more useful time in morning. People can get small hobbies in morning parttime such as water the plants, read the newspaper, and cook a healthy breakfast. Taking persnal time and relaxing is necessary in modern people's busy life.
 Some says that it is easier to work at night because cafes and libraries are open until night. However, in the morning, there are no distraction factors. People can feel the cool night air, pleasant birdsong, and quiet streets only in the morning. People can be completely uninterrupted when jogging, doing yoga, and working on a project, etc. Conversely, there are many distraction factors at night, such as the sound of eating at a restaurant, loud singing from the street, and sound of car horns.

     People's sleep hours are totally different. Some people prefer to get up early in the morning while others prefer to get up late. As people get up in their preference, their working hours is also different. People who get up late are work until late at night, even midnight. In my opinion, however, getting up early is beneficial for several reasons.
     First of all, health is one advantage of getting up early. Genetically, animals have system of getting up at morning and sleeping at night. For example, chicken's loud voice can be heard at every morning. Therefore, following the body's system makes people natural, which leads to healthy. If someone wants to work at night, the health of body might be broken.
     In addition to health, spending more time freely is another benefit of getting up early. If workers who get up late choose to postpone a work, they must do the work at night. On the other hand, if workers get up early, although they can postpone a work, they have a plenty of time to do work. They can work after the lunch, or evening. As a result, people who get up early can spend more time freely as their condition.
     Some argue that working until at night is efficient because it can do alone. However, getting up early and working at morning is more efficient. Most of the events occur in daytime, so working at morning is more efficient because of collaboration. In the night, most of the works might be done alone; thus, nobody can help the works.

1131	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"There are many advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom.

First of all, students can be given more opportunities to study. Nowadays there are many students who want to study in other countries. If there is no online video lecture, they have to come to take the lecture to the country where the lecture is. However, this is too difficult for them because of time and money. By using online video lectures, students can watch lectures regardless of their location. Therefore, students can get more chances to study what they want.

Second, students can study more effectively. They can watch lectures regardless of their time. This makes students can focus on their study. Let’s take an example with my story. I use to get up late in the morning and go to bed late in night. In last semester, I was too tired to go to the classroom early in the morning and I couldn’t focus on the lecture. But, in this semester, I can take the course watching online video lectures and I can watch the lectures whenever I want. I don’t need to get up early and it makes me more focus on the lecture.

Lastly, students can save a lot of time. There are many students commuting to the university and most of them take a lot of time for commuting. If they watch online video lectures, they don’t need to go to the university. They can save a lot of time and they can use it for more important things for them."	3	3	2.5	8.5
1132	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" Nowadays, there are many classes conducting online. There are many problems caused such as connecting error, cheating. However, online classes have also advantages. As far as I am concerned, there are two big advantages.
 First, students can get a class anywhere, anytime they can access to online. Online lectures do not need any classroom. Students generally get their online classes with their laptop or cell phone. It gives location and time free. This fact makes student study more efficient than studying by traditional way. To be more specific, in my case, I am watching online lectures in my room, near my bed. It means, I can attend the class without any huge moving. When I attended the live lecture, I should wake up much earlier to be at the classroom. In contrast, I could have more time to spend for me such as working out, reading a book before attending a class due to reducing the moving time. This advantage gives me a huge convenience.
 Second, students can access other materials during the lecture. In these days, there are so much information at the web site. While they engage in the online class, they can get much information from the website such as figures, articles which can help student comprehend the lecture. For example, in biology class, there are so many figures that students have to look at. However, they can get only few figures from the lecture slide or text book. This makes them confused. In online lecture case, they can get more figures or videos from the online, and they can comprehend the lecture finally.
 To be summarized, points of location free and information access are advantages for online video lecture. These make students study more convenient and efficient."	4	3	2.5	9.5
1133	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" COVID-19 pandemic changed many things because it’s easy to move to other human. It was very important to make people don’t contact each other, so KAIST turned live lecture to online lecture, and let students can study at their home. I am sorry about this situation, and I think viewing live lecture in a traditional classroom was better than online video lectures.
 First, we can be familiar to others. We could have team project at home each other by ‘Zoom’ or ‘Kakaotalk’. However, these programs don’t give us the feeling that we are doing some work together. We don’t have exact that we will meet our team soon at KAIST by face-to-face, and this makes us feel like we are just doing individual work. I think be friendly with other student is important because we can help each other, or mentioning some quizzes or homework to other student. This is same to relationship between student and professor or TAs.
 Second, it’s much easier to contact with professor or TAs. Online video lectures give due to watch video. This means students watch lectures in different time, and professor and TAs cannot wait for students question every time. They have their own work. Students know this fact, and it’s hard to ask something that seems not important like quiz’s time and etc. When we viewed live lecture in ad traditional classroom, we could just go to TA or professor at break time, and ask some question.
 Third, going to traditional classroom makes better attitude. During moving time, we remind what’s in next class and prepare for it. It’s easier to prepare physical options at home, but actually this just costs few minutes either online and offline. However, in breaktime at home, we just keep sitting on chair and watching phone or using computer. It’s too comfortable. I think bit uncomfortableness makes refresh people and make better attitude.
 These reasons made me to want to have live lecture again, I know ‘Pandemic’ situation is dangerous and we all need to care about this situation. For our health and our family’s health, we shouldn’t avoid online lecture and just keep going to school. When COVID-19 is gone, and if I have a chance to choose between online video lecture and viewing live lecture, I will choose live lecture. "	2.5	3	2.5	8
1134	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"I think online video lecture have some advantages versus traditional lecture. First of all, I can take part in class everywhere. I can login Zoom in café or at home which I am. I can save some moving time that I waist time by taking bus and waking toward traditional classroom. Then I am able to use time very efficient way. For example, I can memorize some vocabulary and read some books in this short free time. And second reason is we don’t have to worried about COVID-19. In online lecture we can avoid face-to-face meeting which is dangerous these days. Not only COVID-19, We can protect ourselves from colds and flus. When we think about these days high school class and high school student who learn in face-to-face traditional classroom. They should wear their mask which hide their face. Even though there are in face-to-face, they can’t feel face-to-face because they can’t see their friend facial expression. Third reason is we can use technical devices via online lecture such as smart phone, laptop and I pad. People who are in KAIST have leading technology and science. In this perspective, we have to use technical devices very well. So we can learn about technical devices and many online technical systems by online video class. For these reasons saving time, protect ourselves and using technical devices, there are some good point in online lectures."	3	2.5	2.5	8

"After Covid-19, we meet big problem in class. Schools and Universities use online video lecture to make class, but it has several advantages and disadvantages. There is many advantages like we can attend class in everywhere, we can eat home meal every day, etc. However, I think live lectures in a traditional classroom is better than online lecture. There is two reasons of why I think offline lecture is better, online lecture is hard to study hard, and because of online lecture we can’t meet other students.
First, it is hard to take attention in online lecture. Because in online lecture we participate class in dormitory or in home. There are bed, phone, television, refrigerator near desk. This kind of condition make hard to take attention. Also, except live meeting online lecture, other online lectures do not have some method to check that student is take attention or not.
Second, in online class, it is hard to communicate with other students. In my case, I like study with other people in same place. Students will be friend in this condition, and it will make us more comfortable to join class. In online class, it is uncomfortable to talk with other students in zoom online class. 
There is several disadvantages of online class more, but I think attendance and communication problem is biggest problem. But some people like online class more than offline class. I’m freshman in KAIST and I want real university life in KAIST. I really want to finish Covid-19, and meet other students in live lectures in KAIST traditional classroom."	2.5	2	2	6.5
1136	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"As a result of COVID-19, KAIST has kept doing oline lecture thourough KLMS,
or other learnig web sites for a whole spring semester.
I think this kinds of online lectures have some advantages comparing traditional
classroom lectures.
Firstly, the students can organize their study patterns freely. In online lectures,
alomost of students do not have to take a lecture on preset time because they
are uploaded online. So, we can make a perfectly-fit study plan on our own :
take a physics lecture , do chemistry assignments when I want, for example.
These study patterns can improve one’s learning efficiency
Secondly, the students can improve responsibility and honestiness.
Many students say that they do not best in studying during the online lectures
because they spend lots of time in home.
But I think through online lectures when studying lonely is important, we are
able to improve our responsibility and honestiness about learning.
For example, we may feel to hate to study because we do not have to go to any
classes, but looing at upcoming homework due and midterm/final exam, we
eventually study on self.
So, we can internalize self-studying habits that will pave the way to our great
attitude to a study.
So far, I said the advangates of watching online lectures in a aspect free study
pattern, learning responsibility.
Fall semester may be also an online semester, but we have to treat this as an
opportunity to practice and improve our self studying attitude."	3	3	2	8

some live-zoom classes. ). So this can increase convenience of attending
lecture. Second, we can repeat the lecture. If we watch the recorded lecture
that is posted in website, we can adjust the speed of lecture. We can pause or
repeat the lecture until we understand.
By the way the live lecture in classroom also has 2 advantages. First, it is easy
for that kind of class to contact with other people like students, professors etc.
Because if we go to school and listen the lecture, we do some activities like
projects, presentations and group discussion. And also we can meet the others
after the class to hang out. These points can make new connection between
the others and us. Second, because of that new connection, we can study in
more efficient way. By meeting the classmate and discussing about some
topics about the lecture we can understand contents of the lecture more deeply.
And when we have some problem in studying, we can ask them for help!
In this short wrinting, I introduced the advantages of watching lectures in online
class or traditional live classroom. Thank you for reading. :)"	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
1138	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"These days, due to the COVID-19, almost every schools and universities can’t do the offline class.
But it is not possible to stop educating, so online class using internet education platform are now
using. Not only students but also teachers and professor are used to this type of class, many
problems occurs. But online classes also have positive effects and I’ll give the two reasons.
First, we can repeat the videos anytime I we want to see. In previous, while we were in the lectures,
if we lose some part of the lecture, it is not easy to remind the contents of the class. But studying with
online videos, we can stop the video when we can’t understand well and can repeat the videos to
review the lecture. For example, when I was high school students, I joined the online lectures at
Megastudy and I have the great improvement in mathematics.
Secondly, professors can provide high-quality materials in their classes. Some classes like PH141
need experiments to show the theory can be seen in realities. But in offline class it is not easy to show
various materials because of the limit of time and money. However, in online class, if lecturers prepare
the contents just one time, they can show their contents every students in the class. It is good for both
students and lecturers.
For these reasons, online classes have advantages versus viewing the live lecture. But if the
negative effects of this type of class can be improved, many students in the COVID-19 situations will
more confident with the educations. I hope the both students and lecturers can communicate well in
the online classes."	4	3	2.5	9.5
1139	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"Nowaday, most of people take a mask on their face because of COVID-19. And because the
schools are the most dangerous place for students, they have to join the online class. Actually, I
joined the online class during the spring semester this year, and I think there are several
advantages of watching online video lectures.

First, we can understand easily and more. For my case, TAs were uproad lecture videos on the
website so I can watch the lecture video again and again since I understand the lecture. If I
have to join the live lectures in a classroom, there is no chance to watch the lecture again. Also,
there is no chance to listen the explain of professor, and it makes us to understand more slowly.

Second, it is more efficient to pay attention than the live class. Most online classes are able to
watch video for time free, so we can watch the video anytime we want. For me, there is time
that have made me always tired, so I usually avoid that time to watch the lectures. In live class,
we should take a class at the decided time. And if the lectures are in very early morning, lots of
students are difficult to pay attention 100% to the class because they are often tired in the
morning.

Lastly, we can make a question about the lecture more easily. Though I have never take the
live class in KAIST, as I imagine the live class, I think I could not make a question for professor
during the live lecture because there are so many people in front of me. But in online class, we
can upload our question in the Q&amp;A or we can ask on chat in the online live class. It solves the
feeling of shy that the situation for making a question, so students can have the answers of their
questions more easily.

Because of the three reasons above, I think watching online video lectures gives us more
advantages than viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom. Since the online lectures are
necessary these days, I think students can study more efficiently if they use the advantages as
well."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1140	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"These days, We can’t go school because of COVID-19. This spring semester, We can take a class
by watching on-line lecture not viewing live lecture. So, Today I am going to write about the
advantages for different ways to take a class.
There are Three advantages for watching on-line lecture. First, We can use our time more flexible.
In this semester, I have 9 AM classes for every day. Moreover, I’m not good at wake up early. If I was
in campus, I think my grade will be F because of participant score. Fortunately, These class lectures
were just watch videos on time. So, I can sleep more and take a class not late. Next, We can take a
lesson Everywhere. By Online semester, I can take some travels with my family. If this semester is
normal, I should live in Daejeon. But I am in my house now. So, We can spend more time with family
and take a travel with family. Finally, I can playback lecture video If I can’t understand lecture. And I
can pause video If I want to go toilet. So, We can study harder than normal semester.
However, There are Three advantages for viewing live lecture. First, We can communication both
directions between professor and students. We can ask some questions on KLMS, but we have to
wait until TA or professor read and answer to me. But, When I take a live lecture, I can ask and get
some feedbacks faster than Online-lecture. Second, This lecture way is more comfortable. Because,
We use this method for more than 10 years. It is more comfortable than On-line lecture. Third, It
doesn’t matter about wifi connection or other problems for electronic devices such as Laptop, Wifi or
Cell-phone. In my case, During the Final zoom exam, The wifi system doesn’t work and I just upload
my answer sheet. I think It doesn’t have any problems with wifi or devices problems. It can be some
advantages.
For my opinion, I think On-line lecture is better than live lecture to me. Because, I am using my time
very flexible. I can study Spanish and English. And I have some special experiences during this
Spring on-line semester. It is more valuable to me. So, There are some advantages for each lecture
way, and I think On-line lecture’s advantage is more valuable to me. Thank you for reading."	3	3	2	8
1141	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"Because of the COVID-19, all of class is change. All student in college, high school, even mid school take a
online lecture. We see online video and get a lecture for professor at ZOOM. This big change makes lots of
issue.
Lots of cheating, hard to make question, and hard to understand If professor have a issue of computer. For this
issue, It looks like online class is very bad. But that’s not all. There are some good thing. I want to show you this
thing.
First, for online class we can choose time to get class. This is huge advantage. For my case, I’m deep sleeper so
wake up at early time is hard work. This give me lots of problem, when we take offline class. But in online class
we can see video at noon or night. For this I can take class in clear attendance and I don’t late at class.
Second, We can see lecture one more time, If we want. At offline class, There are no way to get lecture one
more time if we don’t understand the lecture. We just make a question to TA or Professor. In online class we can
see lecture more and more. This help to understand lectures and don’t miss the important thing.
Last, We can use Internet search directly. When we take class, Their can be hard word or non understandable
things. If we have this things, in online class, we can search this things immediately. This can make lecture more
understandable.
For change of offline class to online class, lots of advantage and disadvantage occur. Someone think good thing
is bigger, and someone might think the bad thing is bigger. But this change is for all of students so how about
think this is good thing?"	3	3.5	2	8.5
1142	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"In these COVID-19 situation, we are usually taking class on online, either recorded form or
live form. Here in KAIST, instructors use KLMS(Kaist LMS), edwith 4.0, ZOOM, and etc. Although it is
non-spontaneous situation which is ineffective for some lecture, this type of lectures has been tried.
Because, it has many advantages from online and recorded form. Let’s look at some of these
advantages for recorded format.
First, there is any limitation on time and space for taking lecture. Students can take lecture in
morning, evening, or even in deep-night! With lap-top(or any smart-device) and ear-phone, we can
take lecture in everywhere, anytime. This feature is very good for many points. For example, students
in other countries where time standard is differed from university could not study in their routine. With
online lecture, however, the problem is nothing!
Second, students can easily review the lectures. From time-space freedom, participants can
watch the lectures twice or more. In traditional live classroom, they should have to record lecture by
own devices. It is hesitated method and can make legal problem. But, when instructors use online
format originally, these problems are clearly solved.
Lastly, pausing, adjusting speed, and several methods on lecture are available. Since the
lecture on online is own time for one student, preferences for them can be enabled. Students who are
not good at English listening will slow down the video, and students who have not enough time will
increase speed. The effiency is extremely increased.
To sum up, online recorded lectures have advantages on time-space freedom. By using this
type, the lecture can be each student’s own time and space for learning. With technological
progressive, this type will be the main method for lecture."	3	3	2.5	8.5

classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion

These days, many middle schools, high schools, and colleges use online video lectures. Online
lectures are more advantageous to take classes than live lectures in a traditional classroom for two
main reasons.
First of all, there is no restriction to watch videos in terms of time, and place. Students can watch a
VOS formation video at any time, and any place until due date. It is convenient for students doing
part-time work. When students want to finish all classes early, they will take their all classes
continuously. When students have bad conditions, they will put off their classes.
On top of that, if students do not understand some contents. they can repeat to watch the videos.
This point is useful for both professors and students. Students can understand more about details,
and professors would teach more information straightly.

In conclusion, watching online video lectures have several advantages than viewing live lectures.
Some lazy students will object to this idea, but they should understand that watching online videos
actually has more advantages than these facts."	3	4	2.5	9.5
1144	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"This year many schools started to lecture with online circumstance because of the COVID19
breakout. I think teaching students with online video is much better than lecturing students in a
traditional classroom.
First, we can listen to the lecture wherever whenever we want. As I experienced in latest semester,
taking class without any limits are great advantages. According to my personal experience, I spent my
time on the bus when I move to another places I spent my time on the bus by listening to Happy
Campus Life lecture. So I was able to save my time while I take the lecture on bus which is impossible
under the traditional teaching system.
Second, we can listen to the lecture as many as we want. Online video lectures allow us to retake the
class without number limitation. For example in my case, I used to watch biochemistry videos again
and again because the lecture was too hard to understand straightly at once for me. It was really
helpful for to understand biochemistry clearly. I am sure that lots of students wants to listen
professors’ description again when they are confusing about particular concepts.
To sum up, I believe that most of students will prefer video lecture which gives more choices. Also I
think giving a video lecture will improve students’ abilities because they will use advantageous of
videos lecture that I mentioned above."	4	3	2.5	9.5
1145	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"Online video lectures and viewing live lectures both have great advantages.
In terms of watching online video lectures, it have advantages such as free
adjusting schedule, replaying video and adjusting speed of playing video.
In detali, First, online video lectures have advantages that students can adjust
academic shedule as free. Many students are suffered from classroom registing
period because the students numbers of class is limited. But by using online
video lectures, the limitation of students number could be more large, so
students can regist to the class easily.
Second, online video lectures have two useful system, replaying video and
adjusting speed of playing video;. It makes students to study more efficiently.
Some people who couldn’t understand the lecture, they can overcome it by
watching the lecture one more time. And the other students who already know
about some parts of lecture, then they can study efficiently by using speed-up
in playing video
, In terms of viewing live lectures, it have advantages such as active
communication, and more pair test.
In detail, First, viewing live lectures can occur active communication about
lectures. Between professor and students, students can ask to professor easily
and also professor can reply to students easily. Between students and
students, they can do more creative group assignments or active
communication because they can meet in real after class.
Second, viewing live lectures have great advantages in terms of piar test. In
online class, it has so great environments to cheating, because of dictionary or
other searching sites. So only live lectures and live test have perfect pair test
system."	3	3	2.5	8.5
1146	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"In nowadays, many students in university study by online video because of Covid-19.
Students are confused first, but are used to watching online video lectures. They also say watching
online lectures is more comfortable and useful. There are three reasons that watching online video
lectures are useful.
First of all, online classes give students more time than offline classes. In offline class,
Students only attend in time and focus on the lecture whenever classes begin. However, in online
class, students can attend and study not on time but on period time. For example, in KAIST, students
study many subjects in KLMS until assigned time is ended.
Second, online classes make students study efficiently. In offline class, when students do not
understand content in lecture, they just pass it and study it after class by oneself. However, in online
class, students can learn content which they do not understand by just clicking time graph back.
Therefore, they can study more efficient by repeating the lectures.
Finally, online classes can prevent people from getting virus like Covid-19. Before virus is
pandemic, it is nature thing that professors teach students face to face and also that students study
together face to face. However, after Covid-19, all of professor and students take social distance and
are used to studying by online. This make another form of education and help people to safety.
For these three reasons above paragraph, watching online video lectures has many
advantages comparing traditional classroom. Although students sometime miss the past when they
study in offline in campus, they also satisfy study in online because online class has many benefit."	4	3.5	2.5	10
1147	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"Because of COVID19, many school and university have online lecture instead of live lecture in classroom. And on these days, I feel something good to take lecture in online. Let me introduce it.

First it is easy to go to classroom. When we take the lecture in classroom, we should wake up and take a shower, put on the closes, and go to class room. It will be different by people’s charector, I take a 30min at least. But online lecture I can just join to class by turn on the laptop and join in zoom. Although I still take a shower and put on the closes, But when I wake up late, I can skip it. And the moving time of home to classroom is free. So it is good.

And second, I can easily learn again. I’d like to learn by my self with the recorded lecture. So in my major class, I always asked professor to let me record the lecture for learn. But it is kind hard thing. Because sometimes the sound quality is very low, and sometimes Professor didn’t allow it(because it is right), and sometimes I forgot to record. But lecture change to online lecture, almost every professor record the lecture and uploaded it online. It is very comfortant for me! So I can easily learn again. It is very big advantage.

Finally, I can use space what I like. I feel that classroom is to small. I remember that, almost 100 students at one classroom. So the desk is small, chair is small. And whenever I want to bathroom or drink water, I should make excuse to neighbor people. But my room is space what I like because it is very comfortable. I can use my desk widely, plug the notebook freely, and so on. Comfotable space make me focus on lecture more. So using comfortable room space is big advantage about taking the online lecture.

So, I talked about 3 reason about good thing of online lecture. Easily accessing to class, easily learning again and using comfortable room space were that. Although there are some kinds of uncomfortable thing, I like online lecture more because of these reasons. Thank you."	3	3	1.5	7.5
1148	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"In my opinion, there are three advantages of watching online lecture over off-line lecture.
First, we can save our time. We don’t have to spend our time for dressing, or having make-up.
So it feels more time saving and free.
Second, I can concentrate more because there is no one else around me, and professor’s screen is close to everyone participating classroom. Also I can completely understand the lecture, because I can repeat the part of the video that I can’t understand well when I hear them only once. Thus, the online lecture is more efficient to educate. 
Lastly, the discussion and asking questions activates more than off-line questions. Most students felt shy for discussing, expressing their opinion or asking in traditional classroom, but in online classroom, we feel we are less being observed, and focused, so we feel free to ask questions or to discuss than off-line lecture. It makes class more active.

There are pros and cons in both on-line and off-line lectures, but I think there are more pros in on-line lecture than off line lecture. I hope the online lecture system still lasts even after pandemic is finished.      "	3	3	2.5	8.5
1149	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"In this time, by the covid-19, all most of education school are using the online video lecture for protect the influence. In this situation, that’s method shows various advantage of online in the class. Now, introduce two most effective reason, why online class is better than traditional class.
First advantage is “Time”. Students spend 4~8 hours for class in one day. Also, 1~2 hours spent by the walking, biking or riding the car. Professor also, using 1 hour 30 min in one class. But if they talk about only main topic, finish int the less time. These show some time in the class is using with no meaning. However, online class only giving main topic with no remaining time. 
Next is “Replay”. In the offline class, they aren’t having concept of replay. If one student sleep or go to the restroom, then he/she can’t hear teacher or professor’s class again. But online lecture provide replay. All student can find missing part again. This point gives equality of learn to the student, because one can understand only once time, but another student is not. 
There are two advantage “Time” and “Replay”. In the online lecture has more advantage without these two. In my opinion, we need more consider about online and offline with various example and aspact."	2.5	3	1.5	7
1150	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"There are several advantages in watching online video lecture rather viewing live lecture. First, we can watch videos and learn whenever we want. Frankly, it is hard to wake up morning like 9 am and attend the class. And also, it is hard to participate in morning class. Online lecture can watch anytime so it can be an answer of this problem. Second, when we watch online lecture, we can use subtitle for the video. In my experience, some class which I did in last semester upload their video on Youtube so that we can use automatic English subtitle. With knowing the terms or search the terms while watching lecture, It comes more comfortable even that lecture is very difficult. We can’t do this in offline lecture. At the same reason, pause is also an advantage of online lecture.
In contrast, there are several advantages in viewing offline lecture either. First, simple interaction is very important advantage for offline lecture. When we have some questions, we should send e-mail or using Q&A section during online lecture. In offline lecture, however, we can ask something just raise up our hand. And correspond is also very immediate. Second, interacting with co-learners is very hard sometimes. In offline lecture, there are schedule for viewing lecture so co-learners meet at class. Also, they can talk about the topic freely. In online lecture, this is very difficult because free talking is bounded by the program like zoom. It is very critical for language lecture I think.
We talked about advantages and disadvantages of online lecture (or offline lecture). In my opinion, I like offline lecture more. Thank you for reading."	2.5	3	2.5	8
1151	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"Nowadays, many students watch online lecture because of covid-19. Someone say online lecture is better, but some say “no” and they want to classroom lecture like traditional way.
I think traditional classroom lecture is better for this reason.
First, online class is sometimes not comfortable. In online class, we can’t choose what we hear.
If someone unmute their mic, we have to hear this for the same speaker. So we can’t focus on our lecture. In traditional class, we can attendance to lecture whenever other people say something each other. In fact, although some student do other work in lecture time, he can study alone well.
Second, we study less than classroom lecture. 
In traditional, we talk about some object with our friend, and even unknown students. But online class make a wall between each other. In addition, Online class doesn’t grade fair. So, many lecture chose S/U grading. S/U grading make people not do their best. For example, Someone can say “A grade and B grade is same, so we doesn’t have to try to study hard.” And online test is more unfair than classroom test, too.
 For these a few reason, online class is not helpful for people. It is just a way of waiting covid-19’s end. I’m looking forward to listen classroom lecture."	2	3	2.5	7.5
1152	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"In most school, most students are getting online class these days because of covid-19. I take a class with my laptop too. After taking an experience of online classes for spring semester, I want to share my opinions. I think online class have more disadvantages than advantages. 

 First, the condition of Internet is not stable. In real-time class, we have to take class with Zoom now. But in 10am to 2pm, lots of school use Zoom program at the same time. So this linking condition is so unstable. Actually, during real time class, I have three-four times to get out for technical issues. It makes my concentration decreasing. 

Second, I can’t concentrate well in online class rather than face to face class. If we take a class in classroom, we can communicate with professor, or friends well. But in online class, the only way to communicate with professor is email. If I have a question for the class, the time between writing email to professor and getting answer of question is too long. And if we take a class in home, there are lots of other things to do during class. We can just turn on the online video and do other things like youtube, Instagram, or facebook. 

Lastly, if we take face to face class, and live in dormitory, we can have lots of time with friends. In my case, I actually concentrate very well if I study with my friends. 

Like this, I don’t like to take an online class. I hope covid-19 getting decrease and go to school in autumn semester. "	2	3	2.5	7.5

" There are some advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom. First, we can study more time than once. If we have live lectures, we may have not understanding sections. We can watch lectures again and again so we can study hard than live lectures. Second, we can study anytime we want. In the live lectures, we should participate in the classroom on time. For some people, it is too hard to go on to class in the morning. However, we can study anytime we want if we have online video lectures. Lastly, we can save our time. In the live lectures, there are some problems to go on the class fast. But, if we have lectures on online, professor can teach us efficiently than before. Sometimes, it makes us very tired but we can study hard.

"This year, online video lectures instead of live lectures in a classroom has been increased by COVID-19. Since, online video lectures spread to the all over the world, some student feel online video lectures are better, while others said traditional classroom is better. Two ways have advantages respectively, but I think live lectures in a traditional classroom have more advantages.
First, viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom is better for study. Because, it is easier to contact with professor. While, online video lectures are started, student view either live class or recording class. Almost students have at least one recording class, so in this class, it is hard to contact professor like ask about hard material promptly or sharing information with friends. Therefore, freshman who have a little friend cannot get more information than others. However, if we are in traditional classroom, we can meet new friend in every several class, and also talk about lectures, or solving problems together.
Second, in online class, there are so much homework. In KAIST, there are many tests, quizzes and homework every week. Traditionally, tests and quizzes are executed in offline. But, in this year, both of test and quizzes are executed in online. Online is hard to monitoring about cheating, so several subject canceled quizzes, then give more homework that replace quizzes. Also, some subject replaced midterm test of final test to homework. Like this, since online lectures are started, there are no exact way to grading, homework has been increasing than past. Therefore, student have shorter time than past to study about exam because of homework.
In conclusion, I showed two reasons why I think live lectures in a traditional classroom is better than online lectures. There are also many advantages of online lectures, but semester filled with full online maybe not efficient. So, I hope that COVID-19 has been decreased in fall, and participate in live lectures."	2	3	3.5	8.5
1155	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"By the great disperse of the COVID-19 virus, many universities had decided to give lecture to students by online video. Although this is quite exceptional situation for students and professors, there are many advantages for students and professors. There are two big advantages; students can take the online lecture in any time, and professors can give the lecture with a lot of contents. 

First of all, the most important advantages is that students can take online lectures in anywhere, anytime. Even if students have an accident and cannot take the class in the normal class time, he or she can watch lecture video later. In addition, students can take lectures in their home and this is very helpful to study. For example, I have taken classes in last semester. One of the class is the class at time 9AM, so if it is live class, then I have to wake up early in the morning and ready to go to classroom. However, the class become online video lecture, it is okay to sleep in and take the lecture later. I actually take all the courses of the class on evening at my house and it was very helpful for me to concentrate in the lecture.

Next, professors can give lectures with more contents than live class. In the live lectures, professors have to answer some questions of students and give some time for students to take notes. This usually makes the lecture slowly. In case of online video lectures, however, professors can give lectures with a lot of contents to students. In case of one class that I take in last semester, one professor said that he could deal with a lot of additional topics in the textbook, because of the course become online video lecture. I also felt that we can learn more than live class."	4	3	3.5	10.5
1156	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"There are two advantages of watching online video lectures, can pause videos and feel free to listening the lecture. First of all, Students can pause videos, even they can repeat the videos. This is very significant for students because they don’t have to follow the speed of lecture. Expecitially for kaist freshman, lectures that teaching science by English are usually using complex and difficult words. So pausing lecture helps student to find about words, and it makes student to understand lecture more easily. Additionally, repeating lecture makes student to prepare exam more easily, too. Second, Feel free to listening lecture is not major advantage but it makes student more approach to lecture.
Whereas, viewing live lecture in traditional classroom have some advantages, too. First advantage is concentrating of student is better than online lecture. Most of student agreed with traditional lecture is more conveying knowlage well than online lecture. In my opinion, it is because professor can monitor student’s understanding by checking their eyes, faces or responses then professor can self-feedback immediately. Second, traditional lecture can reduce of wasting time for professor to preparing videos. Some professors said making videos is too hard."	2.5	3	2.5	8
1157	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"The Advantages of Online Videos Compare the Traditional Live Classes
	Because of COVID situation in the world, not only almost colleges but evert school started to online lecture by using recoded videos. Some people might say that is very uncomfortable situation. However, online video lectures have more advantages than live lectures.
	First of all, online lectures give more freedom to students. Online lectures are type of videos which be recoded what professors or teachers doing in the classes. Hence, many students can watch these videos anytime they want. Even if there are time limit, but students have freedom on place where they watch the videos. Therefore, compare with traditional lectures, students who participate the classes can have more freedom for their time and space. 
	Secondly, it is easy to re-study. In the traditional live lecture, almost students are note taking on the real textbook or file textbook. Although they writing what they learned, but they still have something question or some part that they didn’t understand. However, by using online lecture these problem can solved. If someone has didn’t understand parts, he or she can solves the questions simply watching that parts of recoded lecture again. Also professors accept their questions through the e-mail. Thus, not only online lectures which use recorded videos are easy to search the parts but also can contact to professor just like traditional lecture.
	In conclusion, online videos lectures give freedom to students and easy to search and study. During almost schools using online recorded videos lectures, many students could take their lecture when and where they want, and they can re-study and search more easily than before. These are the advantages of watching online videos lecture."	3	4	2.5	9.5
1158	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"We were doing online classes due to the COVID-19. Although there were many worries about it but, the semester was perfectly finished. So, I will talk about the advantage of the watching online lectures Versus viewing live lectures in a traditional class.
First, except for online zoom class. We can determine the time when we watch the video. In traditional classroom lecture, the class time is fixed and we cannot coordinate the time. But, when watching online lecture, we can see the lecture anytime we want.
Second, we can see the lecture anywhere we want. In traditional classroom lecture, the lecture is held at the classroom. But, when we watch the video lecture, we can choose the place to watch them so that we can choose see them where our attention is the most. For example, students can determine to watch lecture at home, study café or the studying room. 
Third, we can watch them several times. There are some times that students don’t understand the professor’s lecture or ~ the word. In that cases, it is so good that we can watch the lectures several times until we fully understand the lecture. In the last semester, I watched each calculus lectures for more than one time, because it was hard for me to fully understand the lecture by watching them once. And I also herd that many of my friends did like me. 
Lastly, we don’t need to pay money for transport. As, I mentioned at up, in traditional classroom lecture, the classroom is fixed and students should move to the classroom. For students at dormitory, it costs no money. But, for the other students, it costs money to go to classroom. But, online video lecture does not require for transport. 
I think these four are the good point of watching online video lectures. "	3	3	2.5	8.5
1159	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"Today, lectures that use online system are increasing because of COVID-19 and I also have taken some online classes. I think there are some advantages of watching online video. First of all, we can prevent spreading of pandemic. This is the main reason why we now using online lectures more and more. Since people can communicate each other without meeting directly, it is very effective for controlling virus. Second, we can save our resources like time or money by watching online video. In a traditional classroom, we have to go to the real classroom by using time or money. In case of online video, we do not have to use our precious time or money to take classes. If places where we take online lectures and electronic devices are prepared well, we can participate in the class by just turning on our computers and accessing into communicating platform or online video. We can save our resources to go to the classroom and pursue improving of quality of life. And finally, watching online video can remove limitation of location. It is good for some people who thinks watching online video is comfortable because they can get classes anywhere. They can select the most comfortable places for them. If they can make good environment to watch online video, the efficiency of learning will be increase. For that three reasons of advantages, I think watching online video is pretty good way. "	3	3	3	9
1160	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"There are three advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing
live lectures.
First, you can repeat particular part of the video if you can't understand what
professor said. If students missed some parts of the lecture in live viewing
lectures, students often ask to explain it again and professor needs to spend
time to explain. Also all the other students have to listen the same part again
despite they don't want to. Watching online video lectures can increase each
students' studying efficiency.
Second, network is more stable while watching online video than viewing live
lectures. In KAIST, we already suffered from lots of glitch in ZOOM. For
example, some students couldn't participate to the test, and sometimes
students couldn't hear professor's voice. Watching online video lectures is
better way to avoid network problem because it doesn't require internet if you
watch downloaded videos.
Finally, online video lectures can be fair to every class. There are professors
in one subject, and each professor teaches more than one class. That means
all lectures of classes must be little different. A few days ago, my friend told me
that he listened a General Biology in spring semester, and the lecture what he
learned was quite different with other class. In the contrast, online video
lectures can be recorded only once by one professor, so all students can study
with exactly equal lectures.
In conlusion, students can repeat particular part of the video, avoid network
problem, and watch exactly some lectures regardless of class by watching
online video lectures."	4	4	3	11
1161	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"There are lots of difference between the traditional class and the online class by the COVID19
pandemic. Currently, We usually meet through the internet by using the computer or our cell phones
not in a real world’s face to face meeting. In my opinion, it gives lots of conveniences to us. So, I’m
going to introduce the benefit points of online class.
First of all, I can save my time before the class start. In the traditional class, there were lots of waste
time before the lectures started. For example, I had to move to the classroom. Also, we have to dress
up our clothes even some people do make up before they go out. This is not the end. In last days, we
usually go to restaurant or café after the finishing of the class. But nowadays, I could do my
homework just finish the lecture. I became to start my homework efficiently.
Second, I thought saving money is the one of a big benefit. In these days, we don’t have to take a bus
or subway to go our classroom. Not only the moving cost but meal cost, can be saved by the online
lecture. Because I don’t have a dinner at outside, or don’t drink an alcohol we my friends, I could save
my money. So I bought a weight training equipment that I wanted to buy from last year. What I want to
say is, now we can spend our money for ourselves.
Finally, the patients also can join the class easily. When the spring semester started in 2020, I caught
a flu. Because the flu can spread rapidly, if I caught a flu in mid-term exam duration, I couldn’t take an
exam. But fortunately, the online class help me take the exam, even I have a flu. I felt pleasure that I
finished completely.
To sum up, I felt lots of benefit points of online lectures during the pandemic like the saving of time
and money, or it gave the same opportunity between the patients and general people. I hope the
pandemic end soon, but I thought the online class doesn’t have only the negative effects. In my
opinion, It’ll be the motivation of the online system’s developing."	4	3	3	10
1162	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"There are two types of lecture. And I think watching online video lectures are better than viewing live
lectures in a traditional classroom. There are three advantages of online video lectures.
First at all, the online video lectures can be replayed. In a traditional classroom they can’t take the
lectures two times, although they can’t understand. And they can’t take lectures again at test period.
But in video lectures they can repeat how much they want. In my case it is very helpful to study.
Because my notetaking speed is very late, I often miss the important information. But in video
lectures, I don’t.
Second reason is that, in video lectures, students can study whenever they want. All of students
have different schedules and lifestyles. So the time that they can concentrate on the study mostly is
different, someone could feel better at morning, and another could like nighttime. If they watch video
lectures, they can choose time to study and they can make best efficiency.
And Finally, it can remove the restrict of traditional classroom, like space and method. In classroom,
because there are many students, someone should sit far and can’t listen the professor’s voice well.
Also, if they are any question, they can’t use internet or other information method freely. But in video
lectures, they can use diverse method, and search information immediately. I think that students find
solution themselves is very good way of studying.
For these reasons, I think watching online video lectures have many advantages, and it can replace
some disadvantages of the traditional lectures. If we mix two types of lectures well, it will make good
results."	3	3	3	9
1163	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"As Internet has been developed, many schools are trying online courses lately. Some people said, “Online courses are not good.” However, online courses are highly advantageous to both students and professors. There are two specific reasons why online courses are advantageous step by step.
The first reason is that optimal individual learning of students is possible. Repetition is the most important factor to learn something. Most of online courses are video lectures, so it’s possible to repeat infinitely unless students press the stop button. It’s impossible when lectures are offline course. Moreover, student could control speed of taking course. Each student has different learning speed, so it’s very nice merit for student. It could be a better method of education.
Second, professor could improve quality of lecture. Professors could teach without missing details of lecture by video record. When professors lecture offline in traditional way, they are also people, so they might miss or forget details needed to be taught. Offline courses could prevent the situation effectively. Furthermore, Preview time is not necessary. Sometimes, professor preview old contents before starting lecture because those are necessary but most of students forget. Students could preview by online lecture easily before the class.
In short, there are two specific reasons why online courses are advantageous to both students and professors. Online courses are trend of education over the world. Many universities try online courses, and they have great effect in learning. Let’s take the online course and learn more effectively together!"	5	4.5	4.5	14
1164	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In the past, not many of people had their own computers, so taking online courses was not common concept. Due to the development of technology, online courses have become familiar with them. Some people say that learning from online classes has some limitations, such as lack of communication with professors. However, I think students benefit a lot by taking online courses in College. It can help them be safe and save their time.
	First of all, taking online courses is much more safe than offline. Todays, many pandemic diseases have appeared. For example, COVID-19 is spread among people in all around the world and it has high possibility to infect others. To take offline course, students should gather together in a small space. Statistical data proves that people in a room with others are much more susceptible to the infectious diseases than people who are not. If students take online classes, they do not need to meet together, and it is the way to decrease the possibility of infection.
	Besides the safety issue, it helps students save their time. Many students do not live in dormitory and have to use various transportations to go to their school. My friend who have to take the bus to go her school said, “When I took offline courses, I had to spend a lot of time to go to the university because it is far from my home,” she continued, “it approximately took 2 hours.” However, as a result of taking online courses, she did not need to go there, and she could save 4 hours. Just like her, most of students can save their time, and they can use their time for another important things, such as hobbies and exercises. 
	In conclusion, taking online courses in college has many advantages for students. It makes students be safe and save their valuable time. Although these advantages, online courses have limitations, so some people do not want to take the online courses. However, in the future, the technology will be much more developed, and it could be solved its remained problems."	5	5	4.5	14.5
1165	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"After WHO designed pandemic situation, various changes have occurred. In the education section, the face-to-face classes could not be conducted anymore in order to prevent virus spreading. In this regard, at the first time, many colleges delayed their classes. However, as pandemic situation lasts longer, many colleges suggest the online method instead of traditional method. Let’s discuss about the several benefits of taking online courses.
	First of all, students are able to take the class wherever they want. To listen the face-to-face lecture, students must go classroom on time. If they have trouble to adjust their time table, they need to run from previous classroom to next classroom in order to arrive the place without being late. In contrast, online class has no limitation about the location. Students attend the lecture even on the road, home only with online connection. This great benefit makes college select this solution.
	Second, students can use their time wisely. Some online class progress without any fix time. Students have to watch the video lecture whenever they want before the due date. With this change, students usually adjust their schedule. They have to consume their time effectively because they have a hectic schedule. In this point of view, online lecture makes their time table more flexible.
	Last, lecturers and students use their studying material more various through the internet. There is so much information on online sites such as Youtube, Google. In formal class, they use paper-based lecture material such as text books. However, teachers and audience apply far more diverse video, images, and articles to achieve their goal. Many students feel that the materials help them understand the lesson easily.
	To summarize, the changes of way to open the class result in various advantages. Students gain various choice among the place where they take the class in. Adjusting their time table became capable. The range of lecture material become wider. If we improve the way of online course, we can overcome this situation."	4.5	5	4.5	14
1166	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" COVID-19 affect many people and changed their life style. People shouldn’t gather to prevent COVID-19, so college students had to take their courses in college by online. Fortunately, there are some advantages to taking courses by online. 
 First, it’s more convenient and faster than offline courses to many people. Professors can compress the content of their class and make more efficient video. We can easily find that length of most videos are shorter than courses’ time. Also, TAs can write notice for classes and quiz easier because students have to check school platform every day. In addition, students can take course at their home, which is their most comfortable place. Professors, TAs and students can save their time by more convenient way in online courses.
Next, online courses give equal chance to be familiar with professor. I agree that it’s hard to be familiar with other students in online classes, but it’s different to professor. Most classes don’t sit as circle to surround the professor, so physical distance between professor and students may be different. However, on online courses, distance between professor and students feel same. This means mental distance between professor and students only rely on their activeness. Online courses give more equal chances to students compare to offline courses.
To summarize, online courses are more convenient and faster, and it gives equal chance to be familiar with professor. When I heard we should take the courses by online, I was so depressed. However, after taking the courses, I recognized that it wasn’t bad at all. We should thanks to advantages and take positive stance. It’s much better than being depressive."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1167	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of COVID-19 situation, many colleges run on online courses to avoid infection between students. Besides, some college think that this situation is chance to test online courses. I think online courses have several advantages for students. 
	First reason for that students can take course everywhere. Whenever students are, students can take participate their online classroom using their laptops. however, in traditional class, students, TAs, and professor have to come same time on the same place It takes time and is not efficient for students. Online course makes students manage their time.
	Second, students who will lead IT society can more familiar with not only smart devices but also utility programs such as Zoom, Word, and Excel by taking online courses. Since colleges use traditional education system, I think there are some distance between college and real field like company. For example, students wrote paper reports in the traditional General Physics Experiment class, but they wrote on computer in last spring semester because of online classes. They can attach graph and picture easily during writing report.
In conclusion, online courses have two main good points. Students can grow easily by taking online class and be proper person for the future. Therefore, I recommend for students to take online courses in college."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1168	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of COVID-19, students are facing a different class situation so far. The lectures are open online. Real-time lectures are provided through zoom, and non-real-time lectures are conducted using the school’s online lecture program. There are some advantages and disadvantages of online courses. Today I will talk about the advantages of the online lecture.
	First, the online lecture is more efficient than face-to-face lecture. We can participate in lecture in everywhere. Also, you can take any time you take non-real-time lectures. Students will not be burdened by this space and time. Also, students live comfortably at home and participate in lectures to improve the quality of their assignments.
	Second, we can communicate with professors easily. In my case, I feel hard to meet the professor. However, When the online lecture is held, we can communicate with professors through E-mail or zoom meeting. I think meeting indirectly rather than in-person reduces the burden. Therefore, it can be the advantage of the online lecture.
	Last, students can communicate with many other students. If the face-to-face lecture is open, students communicate with only their friends. In the online lecture, we communicate with random persons in the course. It can make students communicate with many other students. Students can communicate with more students and broaden their thoughts.
	To summarize, I give 3 advantages of the online lecture about efficiency and communicate with the professor and other students. Like these reasons, there are many advantages of the online lecture. However, I want a face-to-face lecture and meet other friends. I hope COVID-19 is finished safely."	4.5	4	4	12.5
1169	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Due to the world-wide COVID-19, many colleagues including KAIST teached their lectures online in this spring semester and it seems that a fall semester will probably be a online semester. Some people argue that such online course are worse than face-to-face course, but I think it has some advantages in terms of a study routine, time, and responsibility.
First of all, the online lecture system provides the students a chance to organize their own study routine. Unlike a normal semester, in which the schedules of each course are held, the students can make their study plan freely. They don't have to be disrupted by taking a lecture in a held time when they want to keep other studying. For example, when a student is planning to do a chemistry assingment throught a whole morning, the online lecture does not let calculus lecture in 10 AM ruin one's study routine for chemistry. A schedule which perfectly fits us can be real.
Secondly, the students can have more time compared with a normal semester. In the normal semester, every students has to go to campus and come backe home after taking face-to-face lectures. If one's house is far from the campus, one can not waste his/her time. In contrast, since the students can do everything which they noramlly do in a campus in home, they take advantages in terms of more abundant time. This time can be used for studying hard or lesuire time.
Lastly, the students can grow their own resonsibilty. As I mentioned above, in the online lecture system, we are totally free about our routine, study. It means that if we fail to control ourself, we can have the worst semester : just playing with no learing and bad grade. The students who realized this point can have a mind that their choice determine a result of semester, so it grows their own responsibility.
So far, I have talked about the advantages of taking online courses. I think a perfect study plan, more time, and growing one's responsibility are the advantages. All of university students in this year must use this freer semester effectively."	4	4.5	3.5	12
1170	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of the COVID-19, all colleges in Korea have done online lectures in spring and summer semesters. KAIST was not an exception. Furthermore, there are some colleges which already noticed their students that they will extend the period of online lecturing. Many students may have complaints about this decision. However, I think the online lectures are needed in this unusual situation and have advantages, and I’ll explain two of them.
	First, online lecturing makes it possible for students to manage their time schedule flexibly. Since students don’t need to go to the lecturing room, so it devotes them more extra time. In addition, if some courses use the non-real-time classes as their lecture way, students can choose the time when they will listen the lectures. Therefore, students can make fluid time schedule for attending lecture. This advantage of online lecture increases the efficiency of their studies. 
	Second, colleges can prevent contagion between students since students don’t gather to attend the lectures. In usual situation, students gather in the lecture room to participate in, but if we run the online classes, students do not need to move. This lessen the possibility to contact with others, so it can reduce the danger of getting COVID-19. This benefit is so important in this COVID-19 situation. As it will help the problem disappear, colleges should try to obtain this benefit. 
	To sum up, I explained the two merits of online classes, time flexibility for students, contagion prevention. Yet, real-time classes are so dangerous because of the contagious disease. Though many students want real-classroom lecture, colleges should keep this online teaching way. "	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5
1171	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"These days, due to the COVID-19, almost every universities have no choice to avoid online lecture. At first, there were so many complains that online class has less effective ways to teaching. However, some people start to say that online courses have its own positive points. What are the advantages of taking online courses in college?
	The first advantage of online class is that we can live in our home. First, we can have meals easily. If we are in the house, there are no unnecessary expenses. Also, we can keep our health because we naturally avoid junk foods, such as pizza, burger, and chicken. Secondly, we can be with our family. Communicating with family can make stress that are made by studying less annoying.
	Next, online class can help our studying. First of all, because of online course, our amount of studying is increasing. To test students’ comprehension, many professors give a lot of assignments to solve ourselves. In addition, some students start to make studying group and study together. For my case, this experience was very helpful. Secondly, we can get more options of studying. We can study anytime and anywhere we want.
	So far, I talked about the positive effects of online studying. If we have online course, we can be in our house and study hard. For these reasons, I think taking online class in college has many advantages."	4	4	4	12
1172	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"These days, most universities and colleges are taking online courses because of COVID-19. KAIST also took online courses during the spring and summer semester and I experienced it directly. It was the first time to take online courses, lots of problems are caused. On the other hand, even some troubles were happened, there are many advantages of taking online courses. Today, I will talk about it.
	First, we can study more efficiently. Online courses usually have two methods, the real-time class and non-real-time class. The case of non-real-time class, professors upload the lecture video files at homepage like KLMS. It means that we can watch the lecture videos as much as we want. For example, I couldn’t feel familiar to the class which used English whole class, so it was hard to understand the lectures. However, as I wrote just before, I can watch lectures as much as possible, so I used this advantage for absorbing all parts of the lectures. Most real-time classes were taken by Zoom meeting. I can’t compare it with face-to-face class because I am a freshman, but I think it was easier making a question to professor. It helped us to solve the errors what we had through the lectures.
	Second, it helps develop ability to make a solution by myself. I heard that most of quiz are changed into the assignments because of online courses. We had to take a quiz and went to the practice class if our grades are not good as standard grade before 2020. However, we had to do the assignments instead of quizzes, we could study parts that we felt the lack. Furthermore, it was difficult to communicate with other friends who take the same class because we couldn’t make a relationship with them easily through the online courses, we had to solve the problems in assignments by ourselves. For my case, I always had troubles to find the answers of physics problems, but I really did my best to understand lectures perfectly and try to solve the problems on my own. It helped me to get confidence of studying physics. It seemed to be very hard at first, but I think it helped us to build up our ability to make a solution by ourselves.
	To sum up, even there are disadvantages of online courses like methods of taking online exams during the semesters, we have more advantages compare to our thinking. We can study efficiently by watching lectures as much as we want, and we can develop our ability to find the answers by ourselves. In conclusion, if you use these advantages in the fall semester which decided to be online course, you can study more effectively. Thank you for reading my essay."	5	4.5	3.5	13
1173	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Last spring semester, students took online courses because of COVID-19. There are several different ways in online course. For example, watch video, take online class by zoom and submit some assignments. Anyway, online class was hot issue to college students. Therefore, I’m going to talk about three advantages of taking online courses.
	First, we can use our time more flexible. We can take a lecture anytime until due time. For example, I can’t wake up early in the morning and fall a sleep at 3 A.M, so I can’t take a lecture at morning. This one is very big advantages to me. Furthermore, I can meet more friends and do more reasonable activities such as part-time job or volunteer activities. If spring semester is not online courses, I can’t hang out with my friends. However, spring semester is online courses. I can hang out with my friends. Because I can change my lecture time and study time easily
Second, we can take a lecture anywhere. One of different thing between online courses and offline courses is take a lecture in classroom and anyway. Similar as time flexibility, we can take a lecture anywhere such as café, home and even hotel. Moreover, we can take a lecture by smartphone. It means I can take a lecture while moving. For me, I traveled many places during spring semester. Because there are time and space flexibility by online courses. Space flexibility is one of bi advantage of online courses.
Finally, we can watch video many times. We can watch lecture video many times. It means we can study more easily. During offline semester, we should ask or search if there are some questions. However, we can watch lecture video one more time during online semester. This one is very important to get good grades. Therefore, I will watch a lecture video at least twice during fall online semester to get better grades. Repeat lecture video is one of advantages of taking online courses.
To sum up, online courses and offline courses are very weird to students, professors and other people. Some students take a break courses and go to army. Some students want their tuition return. Despite, there are many advantages of taking online courses. KAIST fall semester is also online courses, same as spring semester. Let’s think about more advantages and try to enjoy next semester.

1174	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"By COVID-19 lots of things are changed. We have to wear a mask when we go outside, and lots of college doing online courses. This situation gives us lots of advantage or disadvantage. For this time, I want to focus on advantage of taking online courses in college. There are three advantage
First of all, we can watch online lecture videos more and more if we want. I think this is the most important advantage of online courses. When we take offline courses, we have to make questions to TA, friends or professor for understanding lecture. However, by online courses, we don’t have to do. For my case, I watched a online lecture video twice if I don’t understand of lecture. We can watch online videos if we forget our homework too. So, in conclusion, taking online courses are helpful for understand of the lectures and remind of the homework. 
Second, we can watch online lecture videos whenever we want. This gives us many advantages. For example, we don’t have to wake up early to take a class. So, we can sleep more than offline courses. This makes us taking class in good condition. So, in summary, online courses are helpful for consantrate at classes. 
To summarize, taking online courses in college gives lots of advantage. Taking online courses are helpful for understand of the lectures and remind of the homework. Furthermore, taking online courses are helpful for consantrate at classes. For these reasons, I think taking online courses is quite good things."	4	3.5	3.5	11
1175	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In these days, most universities in Korea are executing 100% online classes, non-face-to-face lectures. Using real-time lecture by ZOOM session and non-real-time lecture by KLMS is included in online courses. Actually, this type of lectures is very useful and necessary for universities. They should be executed for several reasons, and let me show two of them.
First of all, limitations for time and space are removed! Students are able to take lectures at any time or anywhere you want Instructors can cut or edit the unnecessary parts of the lectures. Moreover, the students adjust the fast of lecture, and they use pausing to make their notes. Especially, this feature is very effective for Mathematics and Science lectures that the connects of formula are very important. Also, in KAIST which has many English lectures, it gives students time for searching unknown vocabularies. According to my friend, Minhan Gang, “The lecture is very helpful for me, because I can find many unknown words in lectures.”
Second, online classes are fundamental methods to prevent virus. The fundamental reason why we are doing 100% non-face-to-face classes is on the COVID-19 situation. If we participate offline classes, it is necessary for the pandemic situation to consist. Although the benefits of offline classes are very high, the effect of online classes for preventing the corona virus today overwhelms these benefits. Moreover, if we participate the offline classes, we have to use a hand cleaner, wear a mask, and participate several activities for preventing. These will be harmful for study.
For these reasons, online classes are necessary for these days. Using online courses removes limitation for time-space, and they are a fundamental way to prevent COVID-19. If you are taking online courses now, then why don’t you use these good benefits? It will be helpful for your study!"	5	4.5	4.5	14
1176	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"COVID-19 has changed our daily life. We never forget to wear masks, and we never
go to a place where lots of people gather. Similarly, college policies changed a lot. Colleges
started to teach students online. Some people disagree with online lecturing because they
think students can not concentrate on studies through the internet. However, in my opinion,
taking online courses in college has advantages.
First of all, online courses save both teachers&#39; and students&#39; time. Students are
allowed to listen to online courses wherever they want, such as café, house, even at the car.
So, they do not waste their time on commuting. Also, students can study while they are using
transportations. Since teachers provide videos that they record before the class, they do not
need to spend their time to make students concentrate on the lecture as on offline classes.
The second advantage of taking online courses is that it offers students a better
understating of lectures. This is because students are able to watch lecture videos again.
Using my personal experience as an example, when I miss what the teacher says during the
offline course, I have no choices but inferred the context. On the other hand, when I was
taking an online course, I can listen to the teacher&#39;s words again and again until I get the
point. This opportunity was a good chance for me to understand lectures fully.
To summarize, online courses have advantages to both teachers and students in
college because it saves their time and gives an opportunity to students to understand the
lectures. According to the reasons I mentioned above, I will take online classes, even after

COVID-19. I also recommend other students to take online courses and teachers to conduct
online classes."	4.5	5	4.5	14
1177	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, most of college students use online courses. Some of them
have felt uncomfortable about using it, but nowadays, they have been familiar
with using it. Then, is it right to take online courses in college? In my opinion,
there are many advantages of taking online courses. There are many reasons.
First reason is that online courses have many functions to increase
efficiency of study. Most of online courses are consist of lecture videos and
real-time online lectures. Because of using PC, students can record and save
both as video files. It can be great advatages. For example, if you missed
explanation of insturctor, you can replay the lecture videos. Also, if you already
know about some parts of lectures, you can skip the lecture videos quickly. It’s
impossible if you take offline courses.
Second reason is that quality of class can be improved. For instance,
by taking online courses and avoiding meeting with other students in offline,
inefficient group tasks have been expunged. Many students hate group tasks
because of their inefficiency, even there is a quote about group tasks, “Group
tasks show why socialism was distroyed”. Therefore, by deleting group tasks,
professor and student could concentrate on lectures and other tasks more.
Also, to evaluate tasks and tests well in online courses, more creative problems
and tasks have been created. So quality of class have been improved.
To summarize, many functions to increase efficiency of study and
improved quality of classes can be great advantages when we take online
courses in college. These advangages would be benefit for students in
nowadays. So I suggest that online courses should be spread worldwide in this
generation to prevent COVID-19. Because it can’t be great problems to study,
as I showed in this essay."	4.5	4.5	4	13
1178	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In 2020, because of COVID-19, there are big changes in many countries and in many
cultures. One of all changes is the method of classes in universities. Many colleges avoid spreading
COVID-19, so they start many classes in online classes. Students take online courses in spring
semester, and they say that online courses are good. Then what are the advantages of taking online
courses?
There are two main reasons about advantages of taking online courses. First of all is
students take a time efficiently. The classes are divided into two methods. One is live streaming, and
another is just recording video lectures. In the case of recording video lectures, students watch the
lectures and just do assignments for their classes before due date. On the other hand, in live
streaming, students participate in the class on time, but the time of class is not so long. Therefore,
they use their time freely.
Second, students study more convenient. In online classes, many video lectures are
uploaded in website. Therefore, when students miss the contents of classes, they just click a time
table and back to what they miss. They also submit all assignments in websites. This makes easy to
upload for students and to feedback from professors. My friends said, “Online courses are fortune for
me! I have trouble in chemistry when I was high school student, but in online courses I can study well
because I repeat the lectures when I want to see.”
There are many advantages of taking online courses in college except above. Although
many students miss offline classes and campus of university, they satisfy online courses. Many
problems in online courses are exist yet. If universities revise problems and make better online
courses, online courses are to be a new culture of studying not only now, but also after COVID-19."	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5
1179	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Since COVID 19 spread widely, many universities opened only online course in last semester. That’s why people call last semester to “Corona Semester”. At the first of Corona Semester, many people feel uncomfortable about online course including professors and students. However, as people always adapt to situation, people also adapted to online course. Furthermore, people found big advantages about online courses. I will introduce two of them.
	First, online courses are extremely comfortable. When people were not familiar to online lecture program like Zoom or Youtube, people felt uncomfortable about online course. In addition, there were some mistakes about using program. For example, professor told without turning-off mute or students make noise in the middle of lecture. That kinds of situation made people feel uncomfortable about online courses, but now the situation has changed.
	By living in Corona Semester, most people have been familiar with online lecture program. In addition, that make people know the online courses are extremely comfortable. Because that programs include many tools which are useful in course. For instance, Zoom allow the live chat tool, and students and professor can communicate even during someone on talking by that tool. Furthermore, online lectures are comfortable also just because they are online. Students and professor can join to lecture only by turning on laptop. Furthermore, they can use big and comfortable table and chair, not the uncomfortable things in classroom. In summary, When the Corona Semester had opened first, many people felt uncomfortable about it. However, people has adapted on online lecture program, they feel bigger comfort. That’s why the comfort is a big advantage of online course what people found.
	Second, online courese are good for communication. People usually online lecture has disadvantage on communication, but I disagree with it. Because by using program, the members of lecture can communicate very well, and it is even better than offline lecture. Because people who are strange make us uncomfortable in offline situation, many students minimally talk each other and share their opinion. It is big problem on every lecture. However, in online, that kinds of uncomfortable feeling decrease. That make students communicate well. Besides, online lecture program also allow some tools for communication like small group meeting, And that kinds of tools help good communication by overcoming the limitation of space and time on offline situation. That’s why the online courses have advantages on communication.
	In summary, online courses have advantages about comfortable lecture and communications. We should get online lecture by COVID19. By using these kinds of advantages, we will be able to get it better."	5	4.5	4	13.5
1180	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In these days, there are many colleges taking online courses because of COVID-19. This case was the first happen for ever, and many people were embarrassed. Of course, the freshmen will be very disappointed for not enjoying the university culture. However, there are many advantages of taking online courses in college. I will introduce about two advantages.
	First, students don’t need to spend time or money for going their university. In the case of not using dormitory, the students have to spend time to go to university and change lecture classes if they take offline classes. However, if they take online classes, they don’t need to spend time for moving anywhere. In addition, in the case of using dormitory, they have to pay for using it and making their own room, and spend time for carrying things they need. It is uncomfortable. If they take online courses, they don’t have to feel any negative feelings for carrying things. To sum up, if students take online classes, they can feel comfortable for lessening times and money. 
	Another advantage is that students can make more schedules in the lecture time. When people took offline classes, they have to stay at classroom for the lecture time. They cannot make any appointments because of the place restriction. However, if people take online class, they can go anywhere while listening classes, so they can make some appointments. Just pausing the appointments is the only restriction of online lecture! For instance, let’s suppose that someone makes a promise with friends to meet in some place. If he(or she) have an online class in the middle of meetings, and he(or she) can say “Oh, I have a online-class. Wait a minute please”. They can maintain the meetings! This is very comfortable.
Freshmen undergraduates will talk about making new friends and enjoying new friends. That is absolutely disadvantages. However, I think there are so many times until the freshmen graduates, so these comfortable profits are more powerful than the disadvantages I said. If people enjoy this advantages, they can make life much better."	5	4.5	4	13.5

1182	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Most of universities and colleges take online course in the spring and summer semesters by the Corona crisis. Through this opportunity, we could find many of online benefits classes. Among them, I will explain two main advantages.
	First advantage is efficient use of time. For offline classes, we spend a lot of time to move around the classroom. On average, students spent an hour to move during the day. On the other hand, online classes do not waste time because they do not need to move. In additional, face-to-face classes required time to prepare for classes. For example, taking a shower or packing a bag. However, online classes do not need this unnecessary process. These points made time more useful.
	Second advantage is that we can study more efficiently. In the case of offline classes, the professor’s class could not take again. However, in the case of online classes, we can listen to the recordings again because they are uploaded video. So, there are advantage such as listening to the missing part of the original class again. It is more convenient to review because we can take recording video. These makes studying more efficient.
	Online classes have different advantages from offline classes. In the above article, I talk about time use and study are more efficient. There are more benefits to online classes."	4.5	4	3.5	12
1183	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Due to COVID-19, most of collage in Korea provided their lecture via online in last semester. During last semester, there are many unsatisfied sounds about online lecture policy not only our collage but also almost of Korean university. Despite these sounds, I’ll introduce about what are the advantages of taking online courses in collage.
First of all, online lecture is comfortable. Think about when we go to lecture room for 9 am class. In my experience, that was a kind of war. However, if that class is online, we can participate 9 am lecture even we wake up at 8:55 am. Furthermore, we don’t need to care about using devices too. These can be a big advantage for online lecture.
Second, online lecture has an advantage in reviewing. Usually, online lecture is recorded and uploaded on LMS system. So, we can review via this video. Although, offline lecture is unrecorded. Therefore, there is just on chance to understand. So, reviewing can be a big advantage for online lecture.
Lastly, online lecture has an advantage in safety. For avoiding COVID-19, Online lecture is much safer than offline lecture. If we remain offline lecture in last semester, we can prove that there is no COVID-19 patient in KAIST.
These three advantages lead us to online lecture in COVID-19 situation."	4.5	4	3.5	12
1184	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Every student in KAIST has taken online course because of covid-19. In fact, almost college and university offer online courses these days. It changes the student’s life in many parts. Maybe some students do not like them, but I can explain about advantage of taking online courses in college for them.
	First, Online class have a lot of convenient function. In case of not real-time class, you can watch the video several time until the time when you understand it well. It makes students study well. In my case, I watched physic lecture video many times for understanding. Thanks to that, I get good grade in physic. In case of real-time class, we can use useful function, such as small meeting room, chatting, and recording. Also, you can take course anywhere when you are in the internet network. I decrease non-necessary effort, so students can concentrate on their study. The second advantage is that online course is suitable at now. In this age of computers, your online documents using increase. Therefore, Online course and online assay become important experience for students. Online document is more profit in information age. In addition, by taking online course, you can protect from dangerous infection, such as covid-19.
	To sum up, online class is convenient and profit in information age. For this reason, I am in favor of taking online courses in college. It makes your life be better."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1185	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Including KAIST, almost colleges have non-face classes in spring semester. Today, I will tell you some reasons about the advantages of taking online courses. These reasons are related to my experience in KAIST.
	First of all, we can use time freely. The ability of understanding is different for everyone. For me, I usually cannot understand immediately after taking the class once. I repeat the whole class several times or some parts which I did not understand. In addition, we can easily regulate the time for watching lecture. In spring and summer semester, I usually woke up at 11:00 am. Then I watch the lecture after getting brunch. 
	Secondly, we can take class in our home with casual clothes. Let’s think if we have offline classes. We need lots of time for preparing. However, in online classes, we do not need time for preparing. Furthermore, we can choose place for studying not only home but also café, library, and study room. I usually watch the lecture in café because I concentrate well in there. Like this, we can take lecture wherever.
	To sum up, I give you some reasons of taking online class. Because of covid-19, we have to take online class whatever we like it or hate it. There are lots of advantages of online classes but I hope covid-19 getting decreased as soon as possible."	4.5	4	4	12.5
1186	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"These days, COVID-19 is working powerfully so many universities are taking online courses using zoom meetings. Many students have pros and cons about online classes. Today, I will talk about good things about online courses.
	First of all, online classes can make students study efficiently than offline classes. There are some intervening sources when offline classes are working but in online classes, we can save time. We can concentrate on classes more than offline, and it will make our efficiency high. If we don’t understand something, we can watch again the lectures. Like these, online courses make students save time.
	Second, we can watch lectures anywhere we want. If we have offline classes, we should go lecture room before the class. However, in online class, we can listen to lectures anywhere such as café, dormitories, and libraries. We don’t have to move to lecture rooms and we can watch all the lectures at the same place. It is a big advantage of online class.
	Last, we can look all the friends’ faces. In offline classes, we cannot meet all of the classmates while the class is working. On the other hand, we can meet all of friends if we have online class using zoom. We can discuss various people with random group, and it will make us bond together. We also make friends with it.
	Like these reasons, there are some advantages of taking online courses in college. Because of the COVID-19, we can know good things to have online classes. Even though it is not real meeting, we can enjoy our campus lives by online courses."	4.5	4	3.5	12
1187	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"   Recently, because of the COVID-19, most of the universities continue the lectures by using online meeting programs. Offline courses are difficult to proceed that there are many problems. Students who live in abroad are not easily come to Korea, and government want students not to gather in one area. Some people think that take the offline courses is the better, but I support the online courses for three main reasons of them.
     First, online courses allow students to increase the academic achievements. Most of the lectures are proceeding in online, so they can utilize the information more easily. Although lectures are started, students can press the stop button and find the information about the lecture. Another reason why students can achieve their academic achievements is save the money. Students don’t have to find a room near the college. Also, there are no transportation costs or cost for restaurants by living at home. Therefore, students can focus on their studies more easily.
     Second, students can participate in online courses at any conditions. In offline class, students should take the lectures at the same time and place every week. However, online class allow them to take the lecture in anytime. For example, students can take the recorded lecture at the late of night or evening. Therefore, student who wants to wake up late in the morning have no problem to study. Also, they can change the life patterns which is fit for themselves. Similarly, students can take the lectures anywhere. For instance, they see the recorded lecture in café or their home, so they can utilize the time more fluently.
     Third, professors can prepare the lectures more efficiently. In offline class, professors have several classes with the same contents. In contrast, online courses allow them to teach only one time. By recording the lecture and uploading at every classes which have the same contents, professors don’t need to prepare the lecture twice. Therefore, they utilize the time which is saved by online courses with prepare the more information about lectures or research about their major interests. Then popularity of universities will increase soon.
     In conclusion, I support the online classes for three main reasons. Even though some people think offline lectures are better to communicate or take the lecture, I think online courses also have no problem to proceed the studies. I recommend you check the advantages of online courses and participate actively in online courses."	5	5	4	14
1188	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of COVID-19 pandemic, almost all the courses in KAIST are taught online in both spring and summer semester this year. Some students think that it is more difficult to focus on their study in online class than offline class, but I personally think that taking course online has more advantages than disadvantages. There are three major advantages of taking online courses in college.
First, students can study more if the course is taught online. Because the courses are taught online, students do not have to ready to go to the classroom. In addition, many club activities and part-time jobs are relatively inactive than before. Therefore, students can spend more time on their study. In addition, if the course is not a live class, the professor can teach more contents than normal offline classes because they do not have to answer the question of students. Consequently, students can study more contents with a lot of time. For example, in the spring semester this year, I took a course in mathematics. The professor of the course, Yongjung Kim, said, “Since the class was online non-live class, I could manage my class time effectively and introduce a lot of contents to you.” Because the class was online and it was not live, I was able to study a lot of topics in mathematics very hard. 
Second, it is much more convenient for students to take course online. As mentioned above, students do not have to go to classroom, and they can take the course in any place if the course is proceeded online. By studying in the place that they want, students can easily concentrate on the class. In addition, if the online class is not live, students can take the course in anytime. This is one of the great advantages of online class, because it is helpful for students to manage their time effectively. For instance, I could study in my favorite study café at night in the spring semester, because all the courses that I took was proceeded online. As a result, I could concentrate well on the classes and I got a good grade in every courses.
In summary, students can study more and take the class in more convenient way if the courses are taught online. Therefore, even if the COVID-19 pandemic ends, it would be very helpful for college students to take courses online. If the college held a lot of online courses, then it could successfully help students to study hard. "	5	4.5	4	13.5
1189	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, due to COVID-19, approximately all colleges are conducting online courses. Although some students argue that online courses have a lot of problems, also there are sufficient advantages existed. Now I am going to talk about the advantages of taking online course in college.
	First of all, students can pause or repeat the online videos. In traditional offline class, typically students have problems about professor’s lecture was too fast to understand. Moreover, in KAIST, all lectures are consisted with English, so students have difficult to understand the contents. However, in online videos, students can pause or repeat lecture to control their appropriate speed, and also able to find the meaning of difficult English words. 
	Secondly, real time online lectures would be helpful to prepare the interview for people who are living in other countries. Especially, in KAIST, lots of students are dreaming to apply to universities for master degree such as Brown University or MIT. Furthermore, in America, their territory is big enough that meeting offline is difficult. Thus, they use Zoom for interview or debating. In order to adapt this environment, it would be helpful to communicate by conducting real time online lectures which are using Zoom.
	Finally, it is original advantage of online class, we can prevent students from infecting of COVID-19. COVID-19 has very high infection, so we have to avoid group activities such as listening to the lecture in same space, college festivals, and living in dormitory. Whereas, if offline lectures don’t open, students don’t have to go dormitory or crowded class. In this view, online lecture is a significant method to overcome the pandemic situation of COVID-19.
To sum up, because of these reasons that I mentioned above, there are the advantages of taking online course in college. Online lecture would help not only overcoming pandemic situation, but also understanding lecture more easily or preparing the interview for people who are living in other countries."	5	4.5	4	13.5
1190	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of corona virus, most colleges start the online courses since 2020. The online courses are the classes which using recorded videos and real-time meeting, such as the Zoom and the Skype. Although many students gain the problems with the online lectures, there are several advantages to taking online lectures.
	First of all, by taking online classes, students can save their time. For example, the recorded videos, which are one way of the online lectures, allow them to watch it whenever they want. Moreover, students are able to control their phase of videos, so they can use their time more efficiently. Another example is the real-time class which is using the Zoom meeting for lecture. It takes less time to prepare the lecture, compared with traditional offline classes.
	Secondly, the online classes are convenient for students. First reason is place. They can take their lectures wherever they want. Second reason is the advantages of recorded videos. The recorded videos have a lot of benefits such as replay, and stop functions. Students can stop the videos and note the important parts of the lectures as well as replay the videos where they didn’t understand.
	In conclusion, taking online classes offer a lot of benefits. The students are able to use their time more efficiently, by using recorded videos and the real-time meeting. Besides, they can study more comfortable states, because of the advantages of the online courses. "	4.5	4.5	4	13
1191	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Generally, many colleges adapt the course of offline, and many students satisfy with this. Surely offline courses have many advantages. However, offline courses also have advantages. Then what are the advantages of Taking Online Course in College? 
First of all, taking online course can increase the students’ understanding of lectures. In online class, students can watch the lecture anywhere they want. It is an important thing because students have their own places where their concentration is highest. If the course is taught online, students can watch the lectures and study in the place where they can fully concentrate, and it will increase the 실력 of students. Also, in online classes, they can see the video several times to fully understand the lectures. In some cases, it is hard to understand the contents by watching the lecture video once. If the lectures are taught offline, it is easy for the students to be frustrated. However, in online course, they can watch the video again and again to perfectly understand the contents. 
Second, online course is benefit in the terms of time and money. In offline classes, most cases students to move the classrooms. However, in online classes, they do not have to move to watch the videos. Also, some students can save the time and money to go to college. If a student does not live in school dormitory, it takes time and money to go to school every day. However, in online course there is no need to do so. 
In short, taking online course not only can increase the students’ understanding of lectures, but also can save the time and money. It is important that students have good knowledges and save time and money. Therefore, it will be good to taking online course in college"	5	4	4	13
1192	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are lots of electronic devices and communication technologies today, so many courses in college are operated on the online. Moreover, in these days, the spreading of COVID-19 is becoming more serious, and the number of students who take online courses increased. There are many advantages of taking online courses, and students and professors can make more effective courses through online courses. I will introduce about three main reasons about those advantages.
First of all, students and professors can remove limitations of time and space through online courses. As I said already, today’s electronic devices and communication technologies are very convenient, and it is effective to make remote classrooms. For example, there are many useful platforms, such as Zoom and KLMS. They can participate in the courses without the limitation of space. Also, it is able to take courses whenever. Because students do not have to try to participate in the real classroom and in real time with using of money and energy, they can focus on studying more efficiently.
Furthermore, courses can operate more flexibly and become more active through online. There are many benefits if student studies by searching Internet or using other useful programs with electronic devices. In the case of real classroom, there are limitations to provide these functions based on Internet to all of students. On the other hand, they can participate in courses with their own electronic devices in the case of online courses, so courses can be more active. For instance, this type of teaching will be very helpful for courses like programming courses. 
Finally, online classes are very helpful for preventing serious spreading of COVID-19. As I said before, it is the main reason why colleges want to operate online courses. It is not need to meet in the real classroom for online courses, so colleges can keep students’ safety. Moreover, students living in other countries are not easy to come into Korea in this serious situation. The rate of foreign students is pretty high in KAIST, so online courses are necessary. This reason may be applied for other serious accidents or disasters such as earthquake and typhoon.
In short, taking online classes has three main advantages. Because of taking online classes, it is able to reduce the limitations of time and space, and make courses more flexible and active, and prevent the spreading of COVID-19. Although there are many students who want to take offline courses, but taking online courses is also good decision in the situation of COVID-19 especially. Appropriate operating of online courses may be helpful and useful for students and college."	5	5	4.5	14.5
1193	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of the COVID-19, distancing in society started since last winter, and it led to online spring and summer semester. From elementary schools to colleges, all schools delayed starting spring semester, and some colleges including KAIST still restricting face to face lectures in school. Instead of typical face to face lectures, online lectures became issue. Some of experts analyzed that colleges will keep online courses in post-COVID19. Why? The reason is clear advantages of taking online courses.
	First at all, online courses are more comfortable to do non-active lectures. Except some lectures which require a lot of activities, online lectures are easy to meet each other. Because students can join classes at home or dormitories, they don’t have to prepare a backpack and hurry up to arrive before the class starts. That means online courses save students’ time. In addition, online lectures may increase communications between professors and students. Professors can see each student’s name and face clearly in Zoom, so students feel more comfortable when professors call their name. Professors are also able to see all the students, there will be no student who doesn’t get a chance to present or answer a question.
	Also, recorded videos of online courses are more efficient to study. Many students often sleep late because of lots of homework, so they are always tired. For these students, it is hard to concentrate for hours. They sometimes lose concentration and miss some important parts of a class. Then, in face to face lectures, students have to interrupt the flow of the lecture to ask a question, and professor should repeat the same part which other students already understood. This process usually repeats more than once in a class, and it is time waste. In the contrast, students can repeat the parts that they didn’t understand in video lectures, and ask only useful questions in online meeting. That means students can solve light questions themselves, and professor should answer for only few hard questions. Saving time is a great advantage to both students and professors.
	In conclusion, with taking online courses, it is more comfortable to do lectures, and recorded videos are more efficient to study. Online lectures save students’ time, increase communications between professors and students, and make lectures more efficient."	5	4.5	4.5	14
1194	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"By the pandemic of the COVID-19 virus, lots of colleagues are using online lectures rather than face-to-face classes. However, some benefits exist in online lectures. They have many different points with the traditional class. Students communicate by using the internet, laptop, and cellphone. They don’t have to move to the class. Moreover, they take the exams on the internet too. It made a number of advantages and changes in our lives.
	First of all, online lecture helps to understand students. Students can replay the recorded video of the lecture, and they can watch it again when they couldn’t understand at once. Moreover, they can discuss together through online lectures. If students have the questions, they can send an e-mail to each other, and ask to the professors with chatting. However, the face-to-face class can’t. Professors are able to miss their questions when they are busy. This is why online lectures can help study of students.
	Second, they can save time and money. According to the interview with the Korean Government, students usually spend their money on transportation fees over 100,000wons every month. Moreover, some students may cost dormitory fees. On the other hand, online lectures don’t require them to students. They may watch the video in their home. Furthermore, times can be saved too. Almost students who live in Gyeonggi-do, they usually waste their time by moving. 
	Finally, the fairness of the tests and assignments are strengthened. According to the development of monitoring technology, the fairness of the exams is strengthened. Students have to show their whole desk and computer before they take an exam. Moreover, the exams are recorded. Furthermore, the deadlines of assignments became fairness too. Before the online lectures start, some TA didn’t keep the deadlines of assignments. In contrast, students have to assign their homework through the internet, so they must keep deadlines clearly.
	In conclusion, many advantages and benefits exist when we study in online lectures. Pandemic changes lots of things in our lives, but it brought the advantages of online lectures too. The reinforcement of fairness, saving money, and recorded lectures will be good examples."	5	4.5	4.5	14
1195	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Due to Covid-19, most colleges teach students in online, not in classrooms. There are many methods of online courses, such as ZOOM, YouTube, specific school sites, and so on. Although there were some complains about online courses at first, professors and students become familiar at these kinds of lectures and think that online courses are also good. Then what’s the advantages of online courses?
	First, there are less restricts about time and place. In case of recording lectures, students can watch the video whenever and wherever they want. So, they can control their schedule freely and make best efficiency. For example, I exercise at gym from 10am and 1pm and take some rest after that, and I start studying when I have best condition. Also, ZOOM and YouTube have no restricts about place, so students can study at more comfortable place like their room. In addition, they don’t have to walk to classrooms, so they can prepare the class more and keep their time.
	Second, it is better to get familiar at studying in college. Students should take care of a lot of things in first time, for instance, school map, English lecture, college courses, friends, clubs, and so on. However, the things they should know decrease in online courses. Therefore, they spend more time studying. Also, it’s easier to search what they don’t understand, and review it during the online class. As a result, they can better result than offline class.
	In conclusion, taking online courses in college has two advantages that they have less restricts and are easier to study. I recommend people who don’t like online courses to think about the advantages carefully and use them well. If you use online courses well, you may be able to make better results than offline classes."	5	4.5	4.5	14
1196	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Most people have traveled already a lot, and still want to go travel. I think there are two reasons why people like travel.
First, peolpe are easily bored with their repeated life and they get a lot of stress from their usual life. Travel is helpful to refresh those people. You are able to experience new cultures such as music, scenes, food, or natural environment. You would find fun of life through new experience. Travel also can separate you from stressful usual environment. Separation in respect of space leads to separation in repect of mental. It makes you forget about your work, duty, and responsibility. People are able to get energy to come back their repeated life by travel. These reasons are about enjoyment of travel. However, travel has an academic function.
Second reason is that people are capable to learn new language or new culture by travel. Nowadays, all around the world is connected closely and each country trade many things in not only industrial area but also cultural area like art and entertainment. It makes people to be needed to understand other cultures and languages. For learning other cultures and languages, it is the best way to live in the country where the language is used and the culture is made. For exapmle, many Korean students move to America for learning English. Many Korean undergraduated students move to America for studying in american academy. 
In conclusion, people travel because of two reasons. One is about enjoyment and another is about academic reason. It is definitely sure that travel provide new energy and power to travelers regardless of reasons."	3.5	4	3	10.5

For this reason, people really want to travel. Then, why people want to travel another place? Why they do not want to stay in home? There are three reason why people travel.  
  First, people can get great experiences during traveling. For example, when we go to the EverLand which is the largest amusement park in Korea, we can ride T-express. It is the only place that can ride T-express. It can't be replaced to other experiences because it is unique.
  Next, sometimes, the home does not comfort to take some rest. Actually, there are many things to do in home such as washing dishes, cleaning the room, and etc. However, when we go to hotel, we can be free. We can play without cleaning the room. We can eat everything in the hotel buffet without washing dishes. We can take a rest in hotel because the hotel is not our house!
  Finally, people can eat there local food. This is the reason why I travel. I like eat something which I've not been eaten before. Delicious food makes me feel good."	3	4	3.5	10.5
1198	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Most of the people have traveled at least once in our life. Why do they travel?
I belive that people travel because they want to go to the new place and have some special experiences, and they want to have some rest.
 There are some activities that we can do at particular places. For example, we have to go to Eygpt to see a pyramid, and you have to go to Swiss to see Alphes. You may say you can watch those things through the Internet but my opinion is different. You cannot know the smell, feeling, and atmosphere of the place on the Internet. We want more than just watching in the picture. So, people travel to have have some special experiences.
 And also, people travel to have some rest. You can just rest on the bed, however, traveling gives us special inspiration.
I think traveling around the world is good when you are tired from work.
If you visit other countries or places, you can know the stories about the places and those stories gives you a lot of feelings.
It may help you refresh or let you know what you are going to do next.
 For these two reasons, I think people go travel. What do you think about it?

Although it isn't a essential part of life like eating, sleeping and clothing, but it gives more pleasure that we can get by eating, sleeping and clothing.
 First, travel gives us 'new' everytime. You may experience new environment, phenomenon, people, atmosphere and so on. They help us to refresh, grow and be veteran. If there is a person who have never been traveled, he or she feels that his or her life is full of boring things such as same environment, same people and so on.
Secondly, travel also helps us to keep our familiar relationships. we can travel alone, but most of us travel with our families or friends. travel means not just go and come, but it contains plan, mistake, correction that could happen always. "	2	2.5	2.5	7

Firstly, by traveling, we can get lots of experience that we have not been gotten and we can have new sight by face the culture of each country. Many other countries will have quietly different culture and natural circumstance. Almost of cultures have been developed by using their natural circumstance. This means when we just feeling other countries nature, we could much understand about their culture. It cannot to be compared with just reading books. These ""understanding"" could make kind of new various and deep sight, and it help us developed.  
 
Secondly, we can feel freedom. Many people are almost exhausted while they living their life. Every people have to meet new people, and share their time. Or they may be don't have time to mentally rest time because of their work. But while we traveling, those time is perfectly theirs. They can use those time just they wanted.

1202	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" In my opinion, people travel to learn many things that we can't learn in common life. There are some reasons why I think like this.
 First, when we travel, we can do just for fun. This mean we can reduce our stress through travel. Furthermore, if we repeat this process, we could know what is the best way to reduce our stress such as game, just sit and think about many things, or watch TV programs. So through travel, we can learn how to reduce our stress.
 Second, at the place where we travel, we have chance to experience there culture such as food, clothes, how they think or how they act to other person. Through this, we can learn there culture even when we travel to our country's other city. Then we can get answer our questions from our life. For example, we can think about our questions in another way, especially the think way of the culture we learned. So we can learn culture through travel and as result, we can get a lot of things.
 Third, during travel, we have a lot of time to think about our life. Therefor, we can find out many ways to make our life better or what to do. For example, we can make decision our job or how to solve our life's problem.
 For these three reasons, I think people travel to learn many things and there can be more things to learn through travel. How about try to learn as many as you can during travel? Thank you for reading my essay."	3.5	4	3.5	11
1203	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Travel, it's a beautiful word. People want to travel a lot. Actually in KAIST, there exists a travel club, and the club exists many other schools too. Why people so enthusiastic about travel? Why do people want to travel?
I think the purpose of travel is 'refresh'. We need to refresh sometimes, and travel is the best way to refresh. There are three several cases of refreshing below.
First, people travel because they need new experiences, and travel provides us plenty of new experiences. When we travel, we can eat the food that we can't formerly eat, and we can visit the place that we can't easily visit. Most people just follow their weekly routine, 5 days of weekdays, and 2 days of weekends. It's always the same, so they feel boring, that's the reason they want new experiences.
Second, people travel because they need a break. When we travel, we can break anytime we want. While working, we can only break at specific times, and that would be not enough break. So we have to break regularly, that's the reason the vacation exists. Some people travel on their vacation days, that means they take a break by traveling. I think traveling is an efficient way to take a break.
Third, people travel because they need a feeling of free. When we travel, in general case, we don't be stressed because of work, studying, etc. We can be free when we're traveling. This feeling, 'free', makes us refresh, so we can refresh ourselves by traveling. That's why we travel.
I think people can be refresh by these 3 reasons above, and that's why we travel. "	3.5	4	3.5	11
1204	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Do you like to travel? These days, people working hard in lifetimes often want to go travel. As a result, on the internet today, we can search where is good place to travel by reading the comments of each place written by people. We can even search to think about course of travel, how much money we need, and where we will sleep on travel. Why community of travel is developed as much as now, and why people love traveling? There are many kinds of travel. They are different by people, place, and purpose. There may be too many kinds of reasons as much as I cannot write on this paper. But we can summarize the reasons for three big reasons.
 I think thinking that wants to go travel is beacuse people want to feel and experience new things such as new places, new foods, etc. They can feel new feelings by them and learn something new which they have not known in lifedays. For example, I enjoyed traveling for watching concert with new people when I was middle school student. And by it, I learned there are many people in the world and it is exciting to know new people and learn something by them. Otherwise, if we eat new kinds of foods, we feel new feelings that we have not felt before. It is all good points of traveling.
 Knowing the reason why we want to go travel may help tmaking good tWhy don't you go travel by deciding the reason you want to go travel?"	2	3	3.5	8.5
1205	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" I think people travel for two reasons. 
 First, it provides new experience. Any place which we go travel is not our hometown usually, so we don't know about that place at all. We just go there and find some great restarant, beautiful landscapes, and new things. In this process, we learn and experience a lot of thing rapidly such as the difference between my hometown and other place, and other culture. As you know, our life is the series of our choice. We should make a decision every time, and we take responsibility of our choice. I believe that we make our choices based on our experience. So getting more experience is very important to me, although it is not great, not successful. As many experience we have, I thing we can make better decision. In this view, traveling is the most efficient way to get diverse, unique experience. 
 Second, we can enjoy and be healed when we travel. Do you know when the fight ticket costs be expensive? The answer is vacation. Most of people have vacation usually at August and December and at that time, ticket price become expensive. It means, people wants to travel at vacation and we can infer the reason would be healing and enjoying. For example, hawaii is the famous country for resort. In hawaii, people go the the beach cost and spend their own time, for example, sun tanning, swimming, or just watching ocean view. Spending our own time, doing what i want to do, is healing, and if the background is beautiful, it may be perfect vacation. Other example is the Universial Land and Diseny Land. There are lots of thrilling riding and products of those themes. Many people wants to go other country and the reason why includes these parks. They want to watch and enjoy exciting things which is not in their hometown. 
 For this two reason, I think people travel."	3	4	2.5	9.5

These days, many people travel abroad or another place in their country. People travel by various reasons but, I think there are three main reasons why people travel.
First, they travel to get some rest. They don't work or study during this period. So, they can get some rest and refresh their feeling so that they can work or study again.
Second, they travel to change their ideas, thinking capacity, etc. They can get these result easily because they can contact new cultures, new places and new environments. These conditions make people can expend their site so that they change their ideas and so on.
Finally, they can meet new people at new places. This make people expend their relation with people, and by talk with new people, they can expend their site.
By these three reasons, I think travel is the best way to refresh their daily life and I also think people travel to get these effort."	3.5	4	3	10.5
1207	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" These days, many people travel to various place. Their travel places vary from domestic and abroad. In the same case as me, I went Phucket in Feburary, the winter vacation season. And that season, Many people go on a trip. Then, why poeple travel? Some reasons about it are as following.

 First, poeple want to take a rest. Modern people that go to school or company are very busy these days. So all of them don't have any time to take a rest. So even if time is short, they want to go travel and take a rest to get away from busy life.
 Second, people want to have some special experience. As I said before, modern people's lifes are so busy and equal in everyday. So, they feel 'I want to see and hear something new'. By going some new places, they can have some special experience different with busy life. In my case, I saw many interesting things and ate new delicious food in phucket. 
 Last is to build confidence by traveling. While traveling to a new environment, when they get to know something new and they solve a problem in there, people can get exploraory and curiosity. And these lead to a rise in self-confidence.

 So far, I talk about various reasons why people travel. It is very useful in people's lives and helps us broaden our minds. I think it is good idea to go travel.

1208	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of the covid19, lots of people who contains me can't go on a trip now. We can find the people who want to go travel easily. Then why lots of people want to go on a travel? There are several reasons of that.
The first reason is travel can make people refresh. From now on, people are too tired because of living in fast-changing city. Lots of people are working in the high building and sitting down in front of their computer to do their work for all day long. However, when they go on a trip, they can feel the nature. For example, I went travel to Seolak mountain. While walking in the mountain, I could feel the smell of forest. It makes me feel better.
The second reason is travel is the best way to study about culture of other countries. There are several ways to study culture of other countries. Reading books, watching movies.... But I think the best way is travel. Because when we travel, we can meet lots of people of that country. While talking with them, we can know about them exactly. For instance, what they eating, watching.... Also, we can visit the museum. In the museum, there are lots of things about that country. The museum shows me the history of that country. And most of pieces in the museum can make the foreign people feel wonderful. I heard that lots of foreign people who visited Korea say ""Gyeongbokgung is really beautiful castle!"". It can make good image of that country to foreign people.
The last reason is traveling can make people who went on a trip together more friendly. Most of people go on a trip with their close friend, family. However, even though they were really closed before start the trip, lots of people are fighting in travel place. It means that during traveling with other people has lots of hard things. But by the trip, they can understand each other more and know that they thought only themselves' convenience. I went on a trip in vacation with my friends. During the travel, there are lots of accidents so we were too tired, so we made a small fight with each other. But thinking about that fight later, all of us feel sorry to other people. So that travel made us more clever for understanding other people and getting really close friends.
Traveling can make people refresh, know other countries' culture, close friends. Even though traveling is tired, the happiness that traveling gives to the travelers is much bigger than tired. I hope to go on a trip soon, too."	5	4.5	4	13.5
1209	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Many people travel to many place with their close friends or family or themselves in their free time. Why do they travel besides they have to spend a lot of time? I think people travel for these reasons.

First, You can make good memories and have good experience. By traveling, they experience manythings such as local tradition, language, special place and food. Therefore, people who have traveled a lot will have very colorful and special experiences. Also these things will be a very good energy for your life.

Second, You can be familiar with people who are not so much close with you. Traveling make a lot of good memories to people and can be a co-interesting with many people. So, If you travel with many people and talk with them about traveling, you will be very familiar with them and also be able to be a best friend. Also, you can travel with them just for fun.

Third, You will be able to learn many things by traveling. In my opinion, Traveling is a kind of study. Traveling give many ideas that we can't get from a book or our desk. Traveling expends our sight to see the world and make our mind grow more.

In conclusion, many people travel for their good memories, experience, relationship, themselves or just for fun. I think time spent by traveling is not wasteful at all. I strongly recomand you to travel with many people many times. It will be very valuable for your life and it can't be changed with other things. "	3.5	4	3	10.5
1210	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Many people enjoy traveling during their vacation. Every vacation, I have traveled with family before the COVID 19
situation. Then, why people want to travel? I think, for these three reasons, people travel with their family, friend, or
alone.
 At first, trip can be a break time for some people. Nowadays, there are so many works, businesses and stresses in
our society. So people want to take a rest. So during the work time, people correct their money and use it to go to
travel. Convenient facilities and times give us more relax feeling. During the trip, don&#39;t have to clean our rooms!
Because we don&#39;t have to do anything else, we can get our own break times.
 Secondary, travelling makes people&#39;s relationship more friendly. We usually go to travel with our family, friends or
sometimes anyone(such as package trip product). In that case, we can make our relationship more friendly. Eating
and sleeping together, we can talk with others about special things. Through this process, we can learn how to plan
more efficiently, and how discuss with others. It can makes our relationship better. And we can also make new
relationship. During travel, we meet variety type of people. Sharing ideas, we can spread our relationship. Or
sometimes it can be a special relationship.
 Finally, people travel to get motivation. For example, when I was middle school student, my friend went to China trip
during the summer vacation. For 1 months, she visited Chinese Universities and met many kinds of people. And they
gave her valuable experiences. She told, &quot;That experiences were the most valuable things ever.&quot;. After this travel,
she get motivation and her own purpose. Like this, some travel give us motivation, such as &quot;What we do&quot;, or &quot;How we
do&quot;. This means, some travel offer huge change in our lives.
 For these three reasons, people travel. I want every people travel safely after this semester. Then, through the travel,
we can get more valuable things."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
1211	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Many people like to go travel; whatever ""how"" they like to travel. There would be various reasons why people travel. Some will go travel to get some rest, to see or experience other country and its culture, or for the business. I want to discuss about travel except for the business. For these kinds of travel, I think people go travel since they want to escape their daily life; all-day same routine. So here's some reasons.
First, when people goes travel they want and crave to do something special which cannot be experienced in their normal life. Think if you travel other country, or cities. Then you are planning what to do during the travel. Are you going to wake up at morning 8AM which time you always woke up? Are you going to eat same food what you like when you are at home; pack some kimchi and cup noodles? Most of people will say ""No."". When people go travel they don't want to do things familiar; they want to make special event for themselves!
Next, going travel can make unfamiliar surroundings which you couldn't meet in daily routine. If you exists at you room for 24hrs (especially at pandemic situation, whatever), you meet same bed, furniture, etc. You meet limited kinds of things and acquaintance. It makes you to think same things; hard to be motivated. However, when you meet new things, people, culture, you can break a barrier of your ""thought pool"". You have to solve a problem which you never met before, confront situation never appeared at you home. It can make you to be motivated and enlarge your ""thought pool"".
Finally, experience and memories from travel can be the milestone or manual of your life. During the travel, you would relieve your stress and get some rest . Also you would be motivated. Even if it's nothing, you ultimately got new experience which you didn't have before. All of them can lead you when you are in trouble in your life, you feel ""Why is my life so boring?"", or else. Your memory can draw out yourself from boring-life.
Now we have a three reasons why people travel; to reduce their crave for new things, to be motivated, and to set a survival manual from their daily life. For recent years, a new syndrome appears to peoples, ""Burn-out"" syndrome, which people cannot be motivated from their life and feel boring, be lazy. Travel could be the best treatment for th"	5	4.5	4.5	14
1212	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"What is good student? I think that student that makes their own decision is good student. Students that study hard, is humble, is polite and have their routine are also good. But if students have their own logic, they will be hard worker, regular person, etc.
So, qualities of good student is qualities of decision makers. First, good student has good self-esteem. Students have a few experiences. So their thinking, decision, and even personality are affected by surroundings. (ex. friends, parents, school). Moreover, students that have low self-esteem and confidence are more sensitive about people's eyes. So, it's hard to make their own decisions. That's why good students need self-esteem. Second, good student has no worries when they challenge new work and experience. To make decisions and their own philosophy, most important thing is experience. And, experience comes from challenge. So, to be a good student, you have to be willing to challenge new works again and again even though there are so many obstacles. Last, good students are good at self reflection. They always remind their footprints. And they learn something from the past. Before you look at other people, knowing yourself is more healthful behavior. I think that three things are important to be a good student."	2.5	2	3	7.5
1213	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Nowadays many people go on a trip to other cities or countries. And I think there are various reasons that people go o a trip. What is the charming point of travel? I will write about that.

First, people can get new sight.
 When we go on a trip, we eat new food, see amazing view and talk with people in that area. In these process, people can get new sight because new cultures teach us creative methods or feeling. we couldn't get these sight, if we were stay at home. It has limit to get knowledge from media. To see and feel directly is much better than learn from book or TV. Feeling from travel may be quite different with learn from media. So people go on a trip to confirm their knowledge form media and feel something special.

Second, people want to escape from boring life.
 Usually, people do work or study everyday hard and get stressed out from these boring life. So when they get long holidays, they want to escape usual life. When people go on a trip, they don't have to work, study and clean. They can do everything they want to do. During travel, people can remove stress and think about their worries. It can refresh their mood and soul. So they can restart their job when they back to boring life."	2.5	3	3	8.5
1214	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are lots of people who love travel around the world. And some of them even have jobs related to traveling. It is sure that traveling is attractive sports to people. But why the traveling is so attractive? I have 3 reasons to support it.
First, traveling gives us special experience that we cannot meet on the daily routine. When we travel, we see some old structures, beautiful nature, some special animals, or else. These things are not in our daily routine so we feel some special feelings when we experience these things. 
Second, traveling makes us work well. We cannot work on same thing everyday. We should take a break sometimes. When we travel, we feel so many new things so we can get rid of thinking about the work or some stress from the work. Refreshing the brain through the traveling and starting work with the new, fresh brain will help us to work well. 
Third, some people travel to meet friends. When we meet friends, we eat, go to PC room and play games, go to karaoke and sing, or some else. But when we do these routine for a long time, we get bored. In this situation, the traveling is the best way not to be bored when we meet friends. Traveling would be totally different from those routine so it won't be boring.
To sum up, I provided three reasons why people travel; for a special experience, to work well, and to meet friends. Like these reasons, there are many good things of traveling so I recommend you to enjoy traveling."	3.5	4	3.5	11
1215	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"     What is the good student?  It's difficult to answer rightly. Many people have considered about it. I think there are a lot of way to be a good student. People have their own image of good student.  Now I want to tell some qualities of a good student.
     First, students have to study and learn something that they must do. In school, all of the school, the best way that testing the student is test about they learned. And students spend their almost time to study in school, even after school. Studying hard is the important mission of students. And it's the significant quality of a good student. 
     Second, student have to get good relationship with other people. Student must meet a lot of people in their studying class. friends, teacher, and professor. Without good relationship, they cannot talk about studying or else easily to the friend or professor. student can learn more based on the good relationship.
    Third, student should get specific vision of their own future always, or consider always about ""what I will do"", what is that I really want to do?"". If student study without the vision, they will give up easily. it's important to be motivated always for student. For example, In campus, almost student study and try to get good grade to do what they want to in the future. I think have a dream is the first mission of students.  
     Now I talked what are the qualities of a good student. I think many people agree with me. what I'm saying is the most important 3 things that can make good students. All of students include me, have to try being good student by asking yourself ""Am I a good student?"". I hope all student will be good students."	4	4.5	4	12.5

I think I need to see more, different thing that exists all over the world. Traveling is one of the best way to feel lots of culture and make my sight wider than before. And people might be travel for this reason, not only for fun. In Korea, there is a quote like this; You can learn much more if you see something once than listening something hundred times. Traveling can be a great study for many people.
 I lived in the same place for almost 13 years. What I can see over the window is always same. Just an apartment. I think same scenery and same mood make my creativity worse than before. Because I just watched same thing for 13 years, my thought and idea that generates are always similar. I think lots of people are dealing with similar situation like me. We need inspired moment. It not only makes our feeling better, but also different thinking and idea. For example, lots of artists visit Paris to get inspiration. It means they can gain something different compare to their city in Paris. There is a limitation if we try to study everything by book or lecture. By book, we just learn Baekdo mountain is the highest in this Peninsula. But, I think we can feel the height of Baekdo mountain by climbing it. And the memory will last longer if we feel it. So we need to see and feel directly. I think traveling is good way to do this if we aren't planning to study abroad.
 Travel always mentioned as one of the best hobby of humans. They feel healed, inspired. That is because travel is a kind of process which makes people get away from their repitive reality for a moment. I think people like to see and feel new thing. They want to be inspired and their brain want it. And travel can satisfy their hunger. So people travel, again and again."	3	2.5	3	8.5
1217	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are many good student in the world. But, I think a good student participates class actively. I mean participating class actively is such as ask some question, discuss with classmate or teacher(professor), not sleeping and want to understand the class. Many people do join the class, but not participate it. They only want to get attendence score, so they go class and spend time thinking other things or sleep! 
If all of students do each of individual's work like assignment while professor or teacher do lecture, that would be very stressful to professor or even worse than not having a class. I think the more student participate in class, the more they get in class. When they actively participate the class, they ask more question or discuss more about some problem. So, they will be better in the future. So, I think 'participating the class' is one of the qualities of a good student.
And I have one more qualities of a good student, and that is truth. A good student is very truthful, so they tell people what they mistake, or some accident.
So they are easy to fix their problem. "	3	3	2.5	8.5
1218	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" In school, there are many types of students. However, there are teachers who like specific types of student. Especially they are quiet, good at homework, and polite. When teachers are mad to some students, they always said ""You're not good student!"". But I think not just quiet and polite students mean good students. I think there are three conditions to be a good student.
 First of all, I think student means 'person who is mandatory to learn something'. It means good student should have passion to learn something. Something can be a study such as math and English, or it can be a sports and music. Students should learn friendship and rule in school. Like this, learning is the most important part of students' life. So I think passion for learning is one of the quality of a good student because it means they try best for their own job.
 Second, keeping rule is one of important thing to be a good student. I think school is a mini size of society. We can meet lots of people in school such as teachers, friends, and other officers who work in school. I think the main purpose of school education is teaching how to make social relationship and make them to keep rule(=law). It could be very helpful when students go society and doing their job. So, student who keeps rule very well means he or she can be a good model of accepting educational purpose.
 Finally, honesty is the last quality to be a good student. There are too many people that lies everytime. Lying can be a way to escape such situation, but it cannot be a good solution. When you are honesty, there are many people are around you. Honesty is the last puzzle of be a good student, and it will affect whole of your life. 
 In summary, I think the qualities of a good student should be passion for learning, keeping rules, and being honesty . The reason that I choose these qualities is when student who keep in mind these can be good at society life. All of these quality is not for be a students doing homework well, but for being a good person in society."	4	4	4	12

Many of TV programs are introduce unique travel places. Why do people love travel TV program? Some experts said that TV show give happiness and satisfying to people by travel places which people can't go easily. Then which things that travel can give to us? 
First, Travel make you feel free. When you land new place, there aren't people who know you, and everything is new. So you can feel from how other people thinking about you. For example, you have to care about your looking, and how to say because of people you know. But in the new place, you don't have to care that much. 
Second, you can change your mind better. It's not easy to meet various type of people during your life. Most people only meet people who close to your job or your home. They almost have similar culture. However, when you travel, you can make friends who have different culture. He/She can be foreigner. And also they have a job that you never know about it. Their living style is very different from you, so you can learn new life style, and you can get a mind that respect and understand other culture.
Lastly, travel make you develop yourself. Before travel, you have to find roads, restaurants, hotels, etc. And you also need to prepare how communicate with foreigner. During this process, you can developed in communicate skills, and you can get knowledge about that country. It helps that you think you are better person and you can cheer up to live your life. 
In conclusion, travel make you feel free, help you to make new friends who never you met before, and make you develop yourself. When you feel tired and bored about your life, I think travel can be the solution. You can reset your mind and attitude about your life. "	4	4	4	12
1220	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"he world is large and maybe there are lots of places that you haven't been yet.
And people try to travel various places. But why?
There are several reasons that people travel.

First, people usually stay around their homes and workplace. 
Because of that, they don't have enough chance to go other places.
So, sometimes they want to fresh their mind by going to other places.

Second, they travel to see beautiful nature.
Because of civilization, people gather to cities and they can do many things efficiently by gathering.
So, there are less people in countrysides and it's more nature-friendly than cities. 
For example, people go to Busan to see the sea.

Third, they travel to make memories with others.
By going to special places and taking pictures with others, they can make memories with them.
And going to special places like landmarks makes their memory meaningful.

For those reasons, I think people travel.

There are many people who like the travel. When they had the chance that can take a rest for a long time, most of people go to the travel. Why people go to the travel? There are three reasons.

First, If people go to the travel with their friends or family, they can forget the stress. People had stress from school or company. The stress can be made from study, friends, or company partners. However, when we go to the travels, there are many amazing things. It makes we did not think of stress. 

Second, Travel is the chance that can do to the chance that you had never been. For example, when they go to the other countries, they can eat country's food such like snakes. We can be terrible at first, but we can think even though we finished the travel. 

Finally, When we go to the travel with friends, We can be more close with our friends. When we go to the travel, we can be dirty, hungry, and hot. After the hard, we can think our friends,

There are 3 reasons that why people want to go to the travel. I also go to the travel with my friends 8 month ago, It was very fun. With covid 19, We can't go to the travel now. When finished this problem, Let's go to the travel with yours friends of family.

1222	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think that good student must have effort, respect to teacher, don't much trust himself or herself because that following reasons. 
First, student's work is study. Actually, students should study many things about English, Math, Science... Moreover in one subject they have so many small part. For example, English has Writing, Reading, Speaking,  Grammer, listening.... So, because students should do study a lot of things, they should have effort.
Second, good student should respect to teacher. Teacher is a senior about studying and teaching something for them. So, good student should thanks and respect to teacher.
Finally, good student should't much trust himself or herself "	2	1.5	2	5.5
1223	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"A lot of people are going to travel for many other reasons. And I think why people travel can be explained with three reasons.

First of all, people go on a trip to spend time with their friends, family or alone. Nowadays, many people are having busy life so they don't have enough time to spend with their friends and family. Also, people who want to relax alone can be tired with their hectic life. So, people try to escape from their working place and spend time for themselves through vacation.

Also, people travel to challenge something they had never experienced. There are people who enjoy challenge and travel can be a good chance to do new experiences for them. When people success difficult challenge such as hiking a high mountain, people can feel achievement and this experience makes people confident. I think many people who like to challenge enjoy feeling such as achievement and confident and this is why they travel.

At last, people go on a trip to learn other cultures or countries. There are a lot of cultures and Travel is better way to learn other cultures than learn through books.

In conclusion, many people go on a trip because of these three reasons."	3	3.5	3.5	10
1224	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" A lot of people enjoy traveling. Most of the people may get disappointed because they cannot go travel until the corona virus finish. Do you know why so many people love traveling? I have some reasons for that.
 First, we can experience new cultures through the travel. Most of the people live in their hometown for decades. So we feel bored about the our hometown because we have already seen everything around us! But we can experience something new and we can learn a lot of things  through the traveling. Especially, when you go abroad, you should speak foreign language and experience foreign culture. This makes you refresh and you can be improved through the traveling.
 Second, you can learn foreign language. In many countries, students learn several language in a school. For instance, Korean students learn Korean, English, and they choose another language like Chinese or Japanese. But it is hard to speak foreign language fluently because they have no partner to have a talk in the foreign language. So thorough the traveling, you can have a talk with the native speakers, and this is helpful to improve your speaking skills. So you can improve your foreign language skills through the travel
 I think that people love traveling because of these two reasons. Some of you may not try to learn other languages and cultures and just see the scenery during the travel. It is also good but it is not that different just see the scenery through the computer screen. So, I recommend you trying to experience other cultures and you can learn a lot of things through the traveling."	4.5	4	4	12.5
1225	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"    In my opinion, people travel is very great activity and good for city where people travel. And 
it is helpful to turn my mind and get off stress that is made by city-life!

    First reason, travel is good for traveler. They go first place and do something that never know
before. It is the chance to learn and experience awesome.

    Second reason, it can help city and city's people where you travel. When you go new city or place,
you can buy new food, clothe, culture and more. So, it can help city's people due to flow economy.

    Last reason, it can get off stress that is made by city-life! When you travel in country or rural in 
small city, you can feel free because of wind, natural sound and more. So, you feel pleasure and 
happy.

    In conclusion, I think people should travel three or four times in 1 year after coronavirus is dead.
In this time, we should stay home to avoid coronavirus and do cool thing in home!

    Thank you.

First, of all, a quality is attitude of good student. Nowdays, studying book is very common and easy to get.
So, the attitude of accepting to class decide student's studying efficiency.
In my experience, I studied at jeju science highschool. When i was middle school, I didn't focus on teacher's class, but i got good grade.
however, when I went to highschool, this attitude was very harmful to me. Not concentration on class makes me not to understand about hard study.
so i think attitude is important quality of student"	1	1	2	4
1227	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of Covid-19, most of colleges are providing lectures on online. Most of students seems not having big dissatisfaction about this. Some student says ""When can we take offline lectures?"" with an anger, but I think they will regret just 3 days later after the starting of offline lecture. Be frankly, I think college students just want to meet their friends with free-covid-19 environment, not an offline lecture. They are tired of hanging out nervously. 
 
There are some advantages and disadvantages of taking online courses in college. I'd like to talk about advantages of taking lecture in online. I think there are 3 main advantages of taking online courses. First, we can save our time. We don't have to wash, wearing clothes for go outside, taking a ride for going class room before taking lectures. Of course we must wash every day, but it doesn't have to be just before taking lectures. We can wash whenever we want, except in real-time classes. For the second reason, we can take lectures over one time if we want. We can record the real-time lecture, or some professors upload the recorded lecture, so it is more helpful to study deeply. (But it have the disadvantage of being less immersion.) Also, it is easier to ask questions to professors by using 'Classum'. In my case, I could ask questions easier then offline courses. Finally, "	2	2.5	3	7.5
1228	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"After Covid-19 situation, all most classes in college became online courses. The purpose and advantage of online courses in government perspective is preventing covid-19.  Covid-19 spreads very fast and wide. In addition, Covid-19 spread by air, so we must be much careful. Offline classes(meeting people, interacting something, talking each other) may cause more covid-19 patient. 
Advantages In the student perspective, I can join online course whenever, wherever. If I have a laptop, I can watch lecture everywhere. (home, cafe...). Moreover, most lectures are recorded, I am able to see the lectures again and again. In my experience, online classes except discussion classes are more helpful to learn. 
""The Crisis is a chance."" Some companies(Zoom, delivery services) like this covid-19 situation, because people don't go outside and use their services. It is not a chance for only those companies .Through saved person online data during covid-19, IT technology improved. People are using It tech more, so examing It tech become easier."	2	2.5	2.5	7
1229	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Because of covid-19, we are taking online courses in college. I think online courses are convenient because we can save time and we can easily understand what we study.
 
 First we can save time because we don't need to go to class. Kaist campus is too large for students. So we need at least 10 minutes to go to class. In summer, 10 minutes is enough for students to lose self control. Usually students have 5 to 7 classes. So in my case, I walked 40 minutes everyday because of class.  So if we take online courses, we can save much time.
 
 Second we can easily understand what we study. While we take online courses, we can watch online video several times. Which means we can take class whenever we want and repeat the class until we understand. Students can't fully focus on class for 1 hours. Sometimes we miss some concepts that professor told. And then, we have to ask questions to the professor. But as you know, asking question is not easy for some students. However, if we use online courses, we don't have to worry about that. Just stop the video and repeat the part that you missed. So we can fully and easily understand what we study. 
 For these reasons, I think taking online courses has many advantages"	3	3.5	3	9.5
1230	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think there are two advantages for online course.
First, students can repeat the lecture.
In KAIST, most of lectures use 'English' in class. So, many students can't understand major principles or ideas of class at once they heard. Also, most of lecture notes those used in class are also written by English. If student would get that lecture notes, and if they could read the lecture notes again and again, there would be no problem. But, in offline class, some professors just show it once at class, and didn't share it. It's also hard to understand English lecture notes at once.
By using KLMS, online platform of KAIST, online class can provide two thing. One is repeatable lecture videos and the other thing is repeatable lecture notes. In case of lecture notes, students could get lecture notes although it is offline class, but it would be more comfortable to use online platform to get it. These two things would be very helpful for students to understand lecture much better.
Second, Direct Lecture
In offline class, some student can't see the board because of their bad eyes, location of seat or etc. So, some student can't focus on class by these problems. But, if online class use real-time online platform like ZOOM, these problems can be solved.  Sharing professor's screen and writing down on lecture notes, is more helpful to students to focus on lecture. and it would be helpful to understand lecture easily.  it is also good for professors.
There would be more advantages of online classes. "	4	3	4	11
1231	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Due to COVID-19, many colleges decided to go through the online courses rather than offline class. This decision is based on our safety, and I think this decision was inevitable to avoid and reduce infection of COVID-19. At the first time, all of us, of course professors too, were not common in use of online courses through ZOOM and website(KLMS). In my case, I was confused when I first used KLMS; and I think other people thought in the same way as I did. However, when I adapted in new online-course system and I began to feel free to use those services. And I could find some advantages of online-courses. There are 3 advantages that made me feel online courses are better than offline courses. 
First, students and professors can have some break time between the courses. In offline classes, after the class ends, students had to move on to different classroom to have another course. So they don't much time to do other things like going on restroom, or just rest. I think this takes about 10 minutes, and 10 minute is enough time to do other things. Compare to offline classes, online classses doesn't have to move classrooms between two courses. Instead, we can move on to the next course with just few clicks. This saves a lot of time, and students can do other productive activities like reviewing the lecture, or taking some rest, or going to the restroom.
Second, taking online courses can make students more concentrate on lectures. The biggest advantage of online courses is that we can take lectures in our home. In my case, I feel comfortable at home rather than the classroom of college, and this helps me concentrate only on lectures. I think I could pay a lot of attention in lectures because it was online courses. 
Third, it can help professors improve there lectures. There are few professors who can not give lectures well when there are many students in front of them. However, not they can use pre-recorded lecture videos through online classes. I think pre-recorded videos can have better fluency in lecture than the offline-class. Pre-recorded videos are good because professors can use a lot of useful assistance like videos, powerpoints, etc.
Thus, the above things are the advantages of taking online courses that I thought, and I think online-lecture is a good system."	5	4.5	4.5	14
1232	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" First, when we join lecture by online we can have more choices. if we not, we have consider the place of the lecture. for example i want to listen two lecture A,B. and lecture B starts right after lecture A. at school we have to run from class A to B where lecture starts. 
 Second, we have many chance to be close with each other. we don't have much information about college, lecture, HW so, we have to make friends to ask about it. for example, at first semester professor gave us team projects make presentation about topic what we choose. to do more perfectly our group talk about topic for a long time. at that long run we can get more closer. 
 Third, the transfer of information is fast. many students have question and information. we can transfer it at apps such like 'everytime' 'facebook'. by using these apps we can get information that we can trust. also professors and TA can spread information quickly by using 'KLMS' 'Kaist portal'"	3	3	2.5	8.5
1233	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, because of Covid-19, a lots of schools including elementary school, middle school, high school and college are doing online classes. Some of the students say online classes are bad but there are still many advantage of online classes. Today, I want to talk about the online classes's advantage and show specific reasons about them.
First, students can listen the class various times (if it is in recored class) which makes the student understand the class better. Giving my experinece as an example, I could listen the general physics 1 classs various time which made me, more understandable about the concepts about the learning. additionaly, while I was studying intermediate listening and speaking. I tried to watch the same video various times which made me understand the english concpet better.
Second, By using the zoom, students can question to the Professor or Teaching Assitant more directly. Giving my experience as an example, while I was studying the single variable calculus (which is Calculus I in KAIST) Using the Zoom I could ask more questions directly to the Professor, which made me more concentrate at the class.
Third, By online courses in college, students can save time while moving through the classroom, giving my experience as an example, I had two class directly connected which has a long road which had taken a lots of time to move. However, because of the online classes i could save time and I could prepare for the classes for better (Which was opposite for the classes I've taken in 2019(Where I was in other college.)) 
 
Finally, By online courses in college, students can save time while moving through the classroom. giving as an example of my situation, Because of broken leg, I can't move to another space easily. however, because of online classes I could study in my house without worrying about the moving. simillarly, students who have to study aboard can study with taking time and money to move to another country.
 
In conclusion, Because of these reasons. I think online classes in college had a advantage for studying. Even after Covid-19 I wish that online classes can be remained for some portion which makes the students and professor and Teaching Assistant for comfortable and concentrate at the class.

1234	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In 2020, COVID-19 changes many things all around the world. I think online courses in college are the biggest change for college students. We study at home by watching professors' video and take exams with Zoom. Although most of college students adapt to this online courses, the controversial issue 'Online classes are good or bad' still remain. I will talk about the advantages of taking online courses in college on this essay. There are two big reasons to support my opinion.
First, college students can spend much free time compared with the offline courses period. We can move classes with one click, so there are no commuting time. For my experience, I can study Python programming additionally on spring semester. If I were in KAIST on spring semester, I can't study it because of lack of time. Also, we can use this free time to take a rest. I and my friends enjoy online game a lot in spring and summer.
Second, we can spend much time to talk with our family because we have to stay at home during the online course period. I studied at dormitory high school for three years, so I can't talk with my family a lot. In my case, my family came to the school once a month. It is hard to know that 'how does my family live now' or 'what is the updated fun story in my family'. But now, I stay at home nearly 1 year and talk a lot because of COVID-19 and online courses.
This is my opinion. Of course, I agree with an opinion that there are many disadvantages of taking online courses. After this weird situation ends, I hope that KAIST accepts some advantages of online courses and builds a new great curriculum next year."	4	4	3	11
1235	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"With online courses, first, students can record and repeat the lecture easily. For some students, it would be not easy to understand the lecture at once because of no background knowledge, problem of listening other language or so on. But in online courses, students who have those problems can record the whole lecture with computer programs. So they would be able to understand the lecture which had some problem to understand for them in the end by repeating and reviewing the recorded video when they want.
Second, students can study in their own places. The best place to study is vary for each student. Some students would study for best condition in absolutely silent space but the others would want a little white noise. Also the class of university would not be a that place for students. But online class requires only a little smart devices and books or pen to study with, so that it makes them decide the place where they would study freely. With freedom to study in everywhere, student would study in where they wants, and do their best, better than pinned class.
Finally, online courses do not need to spend time for moving. In offline courses, students also consider the building where they take lecture because, sometime they can't be on time to next class because of the range from previous class. And also lack of time do not allow students to break or have meal. But online class do not require moving, students can save those times."	3	4.5	3	10.5
1236	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Because of covid-19, Almost every colleges has been changing the format of class into the online course.
Some students say that offline is much better than online course. However, I don't think so. I think that
we can get more advantages when taking online course. I will give you two reasons for it.
 First of all, We can attend the class on anytime in anywhere. You can take the class in your home at the dawn
, even in the grandmother's house. It can be a huge advantages for whom is working student. 
If it is a regular class in campus, they can not attend the class well because of the work.
However, By taking online course, they can study in more convenient circumstance.
For example, My high school friend got a job in IT company as a computer programmer after graduate.
If it is a offline course, He should choose one of them between work or study. But, He can do study and work
without ruining something. 
  Second, Online class can be replayed. I think it is the most important advantage of online class
Student who didn't understand the lecture well can repeat with the online lecture so that he can understand the lecture
more precisely and accurately. In my case, I was not good at chemistry. So, with the online class, I could replay the lecture
more times. And it helped me to understand the lecture well.
  Although there is some advantages when taking offline class, There are lots advantages of taking online class.
So, I think we should use the advantages of online courses, and get used to online class.

1237	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I am currently a freshman in college. But since I took classes online instead of off-line when I entered college, so I can't compare the two classes. but I will talk about the advantages  of online classes. First, online classes don't require much preparation to take classes. For example, we don't have to dress well, and you can take classes with a comfortable mind and pose in our room. 
Second, you can record the contents of the classes and listen to the important part again. For example, when we are tired in class, we can't listen important part well at off-line class. But in online class, we can see it back! Third, there may be advantages to timid friends. Because they have a hard time asking questions face-to-face, but in the case of online-classes, they can ask questions through text messaging rather than face-to-face, so I think they can ask questions with a more comfortable mind. Last, when we are in online class, we can get a little homework because of cheating. when teacher give homework, teacher looks for whether this homework can cheat. So homework that can cheat removes in our homework, so we get a little homework. it is all of advantages in online. Thank you."	3	3	3	9
1238	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  A COVID-19 pandemic, which gorven us nowadays have changed our whole lifestyle; including spread of non face-to-face lecture. Non face-to-face lecture, in other word, taking online class in college is a recent hot topic of society. From the bad quality of education to communication problems, the argue of disadvantage of this method keep growing. Then, Isn't there any positive characteristic than traditional one? The advantages of taking online class is quite obvious. The connectivity and repeatable.
First, online lecture made people can study anywhere they can connect to internet : home, countryside, etc. This is quite important because it means, even the distance between members of lecture are huge, they can run a lecture successfully. 
Second, the meterials can be eternally preserved perpectly by recording and saving. Student can keep re-listen to understand things more precisely. And also, Lichard pineman, record his lecture in a book and many student dreaming engineer grow their dreams. But if he could preserve his special thinking and talk in a high resolution and more lively, it would be better. And with recent technology, this imagination can be true. 
It is true that non face-to-face lecture method has some inconvinience. But, it has also a potential that can develop education in collage more friendly and conviniently. And in other perspectives, it opens the way of curing education inequality because It can make spread of high-quality material by those advantages. 
In conclusion, it has advantages "	4	4	3	11
1239	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowdays, almost every students are taking online courses in college due to COVID-19 Virus. Some students like this; taking online classes, while the others don't. How do you think about that?
 
In my opinion, There are quite many advantages of taking online courses.
 
First, it is extremely convenient for students compared to offline class. Students don't have to move around the college, because they need just a laptop, or a computer. You may think that it's not a big deal, but it is actually. College is much wider than middle school, or high school. So, it can be a great advantage for students.
 
Second, in case of classes which use recorded videos for online courses, students can watch them anytime, anywhere. Doesn't it sound great? Students can repeat watching if there is something that they cannot understand easily. Furthermore, they can arrange their schedule more freely, because they don't have to watch videos during original class time.
 
In my thought, lots of students, especially freshmen, don't think that taking online courses is better now. It is natural that they want to experience college lives, because they haven't yet. However, online classes have their own advantages as I mentioned. Therefore, I hope that students don't hate online courses that much, and of course I hope that COVID-19 situation ends up as soon as possible, too."	3.5	4	3.5	11

Many people think that there are few disadvantages when we take online class. However, we can also find advantages when we take online courses because of three reasons. we do not have to worry about missing something. In addition, we do not have to move to classroom, so we can save our time. We can also use time flexibly.
 Firstly, we do not have to think about missing something. If we should take class in the college, we should prepare books that need in the class. If we forget something, we cannot truly participate on the class. In my case, when I was eighteen, I forgot files that need in the class and this fault made my class' quality bad to me because I do not have files to understand teacher's lecture. Otherwise, when we take lectures in our home, we do not have to think about missing something that need in the class. If we do not have books beside us, we can find our shelves. 
 Secondly, we can save our time. When we take courses in the college, we have to go to the classroom. Even though there are rooms for students in the college, It takes times to go to classroom. And there are distance between classroom to other classroom. We can even miss the beginning part of lecture if the distance of classrooms is long. However, when we use online lecture, we do not have to think about times about moving to classrooms. We just click zoom address and take the class.
 Furthermore, students and professors can use time more flexible.  For example, there are classes using both video in KLMS and zoom. Professors can record videos when they want, and students can watch videos when they want. And if we have questions, we can ask them in zoom class. As we can know about this example, we can use time flexibly. 
 When we take online courses, we can have to worry about time and missing. For those reasons, there are advantages of taking online courses in college. "	4.5	4	4.5	13
1241	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" These days, many elementary, middle, and high schools are closed or biweekly due to the COVID-19, and universities are adopting online lectures as a teaching method. Most people may think off-line lectures are better than on-line lectures, but I want to talk about the advantages of on-line lectures. I thought about the three advantages of on-line lectures.
 First, if it's not a real-time lecture, we can understand by taking the same lecture several times. I think it is the biggest advantage of a none-real-time lecture. KAIST mostly conducts lectures in English. So I usually can't understand at once. It's definitely a big advantage to be able to understand by listening to the lecture several times.
 Second, every student can listen to lectures with same environment. In off-line lectures, materials may not be visible by the position of the classroom, or participation may be reduced because it is difficult to ask questions. But there will be no difference in on-line lecture participation or concentration.
 Lastly, we can ask questions more freely. Korean students tend to be reluctant to ask questions. But in on-line lectures, we can ask questions by using a microphone or chatting! This is also a part of the difference in the number of questions I ask on-line and off-line lectures.
 So for these three reasons, I think on-line lectures have their own advantages. It would be better to listen to on-line lectures as an experience, and thinking about its own advantages. Thank you for reading my essay."	3.5	4	4	11.5
1242	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Because of the COVID-19 virus, many colleges have open online courses for students in these days. Also I get lessons by online class, so I could have experience for online courses and feel lots of advantages either. I think there are 3 main advantages of them.
    First of all, we can control our life schedule. For offline courses, we must follow the timetable. But in online classes, because many lessons are turned to recorded videos from real-time classes, we can move the time to watching videos, and we can do other things that time. Briefly, we get flexible time. So it can help our life more flexibly and actively. 
    Second, there are no more limits of time or space. In offline classes, for example, if there are given some group assignments, then it's hard to fit schedules of all group members to do the assignment. But, these problems don't exist at online classes. Also, there are problems for some students who don't live near by the college. Even though they are so tired in early morning, they must go to the their school. However they don't have to be suffered by such problems in online classes.
    Lastly, we can get more efficient for our studying. In offline courses, we usually get notices through two paths - one is offline, and the other is online. So we should pick up the notice from the two ways, and it reduces the efficient. However, we can get the notice through only one way in online courses, so we can focus on our studying more.
    For these 3 reasons, I think the online courses in college are better than offline courses."	4	4.5	4	12.5

There are many student in the world, and student must study in their school.
However, covid_19 changes school's courses type.
Today, I talk about 'online courses in college'.
There are many advantages of taking online courses in college.
First, online class can avoid to meet people.
Covid_19 is very terrible virus. If we meet the person who has covid_19 virus, we can also has covid_19 virus.
But, online class solved this problem. If we use online class, we couldn't go to school, so we can avoid to meet people.
Second, online class makes additional time.
If we taking offline courses in college, we must go to class, library, cafeteria, lab, coffee shop etc..
However, online class is very simple. If you have one computer and internet, we can join the college online class. So, you shouldn't go to school.
Next, we can save our money.
If we in school, we will go to coffee shop, restaurant, bar etc..
Then, we will spend a lot of money.
But, online class is different. If we taking Online class, we don't have to go to coffee shop, restaurant, bar etc.
So we can save our money.
Finally, online class is chance.
If we taking offline courses in college, we can't have only self time.
We will go to bar, taking meal party and work in many type clubs.
So, we can't have only self time. However, online class is given self time.
We must use only my time useful, during online class.
There are many advantages of taking online courses in college.
We can change our life used this chance."	2.5	2.5	3	8
1244	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I'd say there are two big advantages of taking online courses. First, i can spend my time more efficiently. Second i can concentrate fully on lectures as i stay at comfortable environment. Let me give you specific reasons for my opinions. 

First, KAIST is quite big university to move around on my feet. It is even possible for me to take over 10 minutes to move from class to the next class. It's not enjoyable especially in summer. Also if i have to have lunch, it would also take me at least more than 20 minutes spending around 10 minutes staying on a line. I am barely able to take some time to take a rest in between. 

Second, as i take classes in my private room, it gives me comfort physically and mentally. I don't need to take seats at front to hear what professors say more clearly and i can sit in a way that i like to which professor would say that i got some attitude if it was offline lecture. And i don't like many people around me when i need to fully focus on something. But for last and this semester, as i stay in my room alone this problem has never bothered me.

So thanks to online lectures, these problem are gone. I spend my time more efficiently and i focus on lectures better. When it comes to studying, i'd say online lecture is quite better. 

Thank you."	4	3.5	3.5	11
1245	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" There are two kinds of online courses. One is a real-time online course and the other one is a non-real-time. I think the most part of the advantages of online courses is from a non-real-time one which is below.
 One of the advantages of taking online courses (and I think this one is the most greatest thing!) is that we can take a course again and again until we fully understand in case of a non-real-time. online lecture. This is great because in the real class, offline course, it is impossible to take a course repeatedly and so we have to spend lots of time searching google or reading materials. But thanks to the online video, we can just simply watch again.
 Secondly, I can raise my hand more often. Previously, in some cases, there were many people in one classroom and It makes me not able to ask a question at the middle of the lecture since literally there were so many people and the professor can't focus on each student. So I usually make a question after the class but this was so bad because the professor and I both have to prepare for each's next class. However, In the Online class, everyone can raise his/her hands at any time using the 'Chatting' and a professor can focus on each question.
 The next advantage is that we spend much much less time to prepare the lecture. For offline lecture, we have to take care about the whole thing to go to the class. If we miss just one thing, like paper, pencil, or forgetting about charging my laptop, then that class gonna be useless to me. But we don't have to worry about missing something for online lecture because we already have everything. Even more than that, we don't need to waste time at moving to another class. All we need to do is just leave out the Zoom session and get into another Zoom!. Acutually, I have lated a class which starts at 9 A.M.  a few times due to the last night drinking.... But if we have a online class at that time, I think there were no late because I was able not to be late the class since I don't need to rush from my dormitory to the class. 
Although this whole - online lecture started due to the COVID-19, sometimes I think this form of class is good enough and imagine what if we continue this trend after the end of the COVID-19."	4	4	4	12
1246	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are four reasons about the advantages of taking online courses in college.
First, people can join in lecture at anytime. If they has some important appointment so he couldn't join the real-time lecture. Professors have to call off the class and students have to absent for class. However in case of online course, they can join lecture at time he or she can. Taking video or attending online class at anytime they want. And also, people have their own concentrate time; late of night or afternoon anything, so they can choose time they can concentrate to lecture. And also, we can join in other college students or lecture by online. This makes more big chance for conversation that make people to get lots of view about title. It is really big benefit for professors and student. In other word, professors and students both can be free at time and location.
Second is student can look lecture over and over again so, it's more easier to understand un-understandable content. Always there are content that can't understand what it means in lecture. In online lecture, student can watch lecture many time so they can look again ""hard to understanding part"". This is very helpful for student to encourage his or her capability of knowledge. Also, if there are some new concept students can stop lecture and search that word or phenomenon what makes easy to understand. 
Next it gives chance for disabled. We know that it's not easy for disabled to join all classes in college. There are no subtitle or hand-language in offline class or it's hard to go the classroom. But for online course, it is more easier for them to join in class as non-disabled students. For example, we can put subtitle in video so deaf can also join in class. It is most good affect about online course. Give everyone the same opportunity to learn and develop his or her capability.  
Last, student can ask their question more easily. As you know, for Korean students, it is not easy to ask question in offline courses because there are no raise hand culture. While in online class, there are more students who ask their curiosity by chatting. It makes more effective lecture.
These are the advantages of taking online courses in college. In short, both professor and student can join in class at any time and any where, more effective to understand lecture, comfortable for disabled student to join in class and asking question is more comfortable than offline courses."	3.5	4	3	10.5
1247	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Due to COVID-19, many countries are doing social distancing to prevent spread of virus. Nowadays, South Korea is also doing social distancing level 2.5, so people who live in South Korea hard to go places where people are crowded like cafe, restaurant, PC room, and bar etc. In case of education system, all school are doing online courses by using zoom or e-classes because of COVID-19. All college is doing online courses, too. It is true that taking online courses in college have many disadvantage such as we can not meet college friend, technology problem of cheating problem. Although there have many disadavantage and hardness to taking online courses in college,  I think they also have some advantages like listening recorded lecture and freedom of space and time to preparing classes.
 First of all, we can re-listen lecture by recorded lectures. In case of last semester, I think most courses gave recorded lectures after classes. Many students said the using recorded lecture is good for their studies because when students forgot the part of lecture they can re-listening using recorded courses and if we have to take quizes or test, we can use them to remind and summarize the lecture. In case of online classes, it is easy to get recorded lecture but in case of offline classes, it is hard to get recorded files of lecture. Therefore, recorded lecture is useful for students' own studies and that files can get easy when online courses are processing.
 In addition, freedom of space and time to preparing classes can be another advantage. When offline course processing, we have to go lecture room at time. But in case of morning or evening it is hard to attend classes on time and when they are a lot of classes in a day, it is hard to move another lecture room in break time. But if college is taking online classes, students can take a course in one place like their home, cafe, or library wherever they can feel comfortable to listen classes. And also some courses are doing non-real time courses, for that student can listening that courses by their schedule. Online courses can listen classes where students want and when students want, so it is more comfortable that listen class in offline.
 COVID-19 change our life significantly different. We can not go concert, travel somewhere, and hard to meet other people. College lecture method are changed to online courses. Because of COVID-19, freshman stduent can not enjoy their college life. And also, their are a lot of disadvantage like cheating, technology issue etc. But every object have both advantage and disadvantage, online classes also have some advantage like recorded lecture and listen class wherever or whenever they want."	4.5	4	4	12.5
1248	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Covid-19, the bad virus for human health, changed our life. So, we got a online courses instead of face-to-face class. It is the first time that we use non face-to-face class. But online courses gave some advantages for us. Let's see about that.

 First, There are more freely to student, TA, and professor. When we take a face-to-face class, we should prepare for clothes, hair condition, make-up, and so on. But after we take a  online courses, we just check about our camera, microphone, and more comfortable clothes. It can improve our class-attention and make more short time to prepare. 

 Second, We can get some information more easily during class. When we get a question or some specific vocabulary, it makes us hard to understand about what we are going to learn. However, If we take a online courses, we just make one more internet page and search something very quickly. So, We can get some information quickly without class-flow breaking. In addition, TA and professor can give us some useful information by hyper-link, PPT files, and video.



 Third, We can get more time to improve ourselves.  When we take a face-to-face class, there are some loss-time that we go to classroom for next course. But, When we use online systems to take a courses, there are no wasting time to move next class. Just click or chat next class' URL. So, We can get more free time to relax or improve ourselves than face-to-face class.



 Because of unusual type class, somebody may confuse about online courses. But as I mentioned before, there are so may benefits to take a online courses. Unfortunately, Covid-19 is still yet. But how about advantages of online courses? Isn't it worth for our study? When Covid-19 is gone, I think mixing face-to-face class with online courses' advantages will be the best way to study for us."	3.5	4	3	10.5
1249	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Due to the Covid-19, most of colleges have been doing online lectures nowadays. Definitely, online lecture has some negative sides and disadvantages, but it also has some advantages compared to real-time offline class.
First, online lecture can make study deeper and effectively. One of the major ways of doing online course is to record the video and let students watch that. In this way, student can watch the lecture video several times until they understand fully. Also if someone forget the previous concepts, then he/she can just go back to the previous video and watch again. This will help student to study efficiently without wasting many time.
Second, student can be free from the limit of time and space. As I mentioned, recorded video is the dominant way of doing online course and this way have much less bound compared to offline lecture. We can watch the lecture video anytime and anywhere we want. We can study at home, cafe, and library. Maybe we can delay the studying time and do many other things in that time. For short, we can do a lot of thing to improve ourselves in the time which is made by the online course.
Third, we can be familiar with the online environment. The world is changing faster and faster toward the online, so we will work, study, meet people in online world in future. In this circumstances, using  some online meeting system like Zoom is helpful and meaningful to us. We can be ready to the upcoming online world by experiencing the online courses in college.

1250	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Today, I will say some advantages of taking online courses in college.
 First, we can study quietly. It can effect to our grade. It may make our study environment better. If we are in dormitory, we use our room with roommates. Also some roommates have some hateful like smells, sounds, difference of personality, etc. These things make our study environment worse.
 Second, our quality of sleep can be better. It can effect to our grade, too. Similar to first reason’s detail, we can interfere our roommates sleep. Someone can sleep at noise, but many people cannot sleep at our typing sound and talking. I already experienced it at my high school’s dormitory. If we are in dormitory, we can get hard environment to sleep well. Therefore we take courses in online, these problems won’t happen
 To sum up, if we taking course in online, we can study quietly and quality of sleep can be better. And these thing can make our grade better."	2	3	2	7
1251	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  As worldwide pandamic situation, every schools and colleges are forced to do their work and lecture by online. And today, I want to talk about college online courses. There were many issues about online lecture at colleges at students and professors, but I think there are lots of advantages of taking online courses. I would like to introduce three kinds of advantages of taking online courses. First, they don't have limit of space and time. Second, students can review lecture easily. Third, students can have more time to study or do their hobby.
  First, online courses doesn't have any limits of space and time. Professors can record courses any time they want, and students can see it any time and any place. It is much more comfortable than professor and students go to same building, same room and have a lecture. Even if it is a real-time class! Not time, but space is free yet.
  Second, it is much more easy to review lecture in online courses. There are lecture videos in online courses, and even if it is real-time class and there is no video, we can record much more easily than take a video in front of classmates and professor at lecture room. We can watch lecture videos any time you want. While studying, when you notice exam is 2 weeks before, or even if you want to fall asleep!
  Third, students can have more time for studying and hobby. Face-to-face class need time for moving, but online courses can retrench students' time from moving. We can feel it is very short time, but if we expand our sight to 1 year, we might save few days only for hearing online courses. 
  To sum up, I want to tell there are many advantages of online courses in college. There is no limits of space and time, students can review lecture easily, and time saving. Thank you."	3	3.5	3.5	10
1252	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think there are some advatages of taking online course. First, we can take online courses  ""everywhere and anywhere"". It means we got our freedom of time and location. So we can be more flexible about the way we study the lecture. In my case, I usually take the class at home where I feel comfort. These comfort makes me more encourage about my study. I think most of people becomes more effective when they do the things in their private place like home. Also if I want to take the lecture at other place, I can freely go to cafe or restaurant or studyroom with comfortable cloth. All of these freedom of place and cloth is from the advantage of taking online class. 
And the point that we can take the courses anytime is another advantage. In other words, we can study at morning or late night that we want. In my situation, I like to take a lecture at night and sleep at morning. It is possibe because of the online lecture. And I always study faster the chapter that is easy and slowly study  the  chapter that is hard. It is also the advantage of online lecture. Because each people need their different time to understand the class, online lecture can adaptive about the depth and length of each people's understand about the lecture.
Second, online lecture is more simple and easy to study. Because, in these information world we can search a lot of things  from google or Youtube. So during the time we take a online class, we can search a information or view a video about the lecture. It is very helpful about our study .And the way we got the information is very simple that anyone can use the search engine. "	3	3	3.5	9.5

1254	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Online courses have many advantages for peoples. This is because it can be solved by using online courses in such a dangerous situation.
First of the reason that online courses have advantages is Online courses help to students because of safety. These day, covid-19 outbreak not only Korea but also whole worlds, It is very dangerous meeting each other. So we use Online courses to solve this problems. Far from each other but, we can get lecture. Online courses are the only way to take great lecture in situations where we don't have to get together.
Second, these courses are convenience. We can more easily to check attendance and status while online courses. It can be easily recognized by progress rate or the number of people in Zoom. Also, It is also convenient when submitting assignments. It is easy to submit because I have to do assignments, then create file and submit it online like klms. 
Third, it helps to study. If I listen in real time, it becomes easier to grasp the content while listening to the courses. But online courses can stop and reviewing the contents. It means I can study and listening the lecture again. It has the advantage of convenient to review contents that may pass without thinking. So, It is very helpful when I reviewing the contents.
Finally, it is helpful for self-directed learning by providing class files and uploading ppt or video. Since various class files can be saved or viewed again, it is convenient to study each lecture by using the time remaining outside of class time. In other words, if I study hard myself, it is rather easy to develop my abilities. The time to come and go is also saved, so more time is available for self-development too. 
Because of these reasons I think Online courses has various advantages. "	4	3.5	3	10.5
1255	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think that their are three advantages of taking online courses in college.
first, if we take a online class, we can get more leisure time than taking offline class.
in college, we should move lecture room when lecture starts. but in online class, we don't have to move around in interval of classes.
that means we can have the time which can make us to make a question or to take a rest.

second, we can make morning confident.
in the morning, we always feel ""i want to sleep five minutes more"".
in some online class , we don't have to turn on the camera.. so when they feel they need more time to sleep, using time which they wash, they can sleep more  we can take a more sleep. as a result we can feel confident morning

finally, we can use our time useful.
some classes are non-realtime. so if our class is full and there is a reason that we can not take a real-time class, like visiting hospital or taking army body checking (신체검사?) , we can choose the time to do the reasons when non-realtime classes. like the example, non-realtime class make our time flexible.

but their are several disadvantages of taking online courses like freshman can not make their college friend and mother's eye like eagle.

although , what i want to say in this essay is that there is a problem which make offline class impossible, so let's talk about the positive aspect of the online class."	2.5	3	2	7.5
1256	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Most of college in the world choose taking online courses these days.
Many people said that taking lecture in online is not appropriate, because it deduces efficiency of communication.
However there are some obvious advantages of online classes compare with offline.

First of all, we can take the lecture whenever we want.
It is very huge profit to students, because they can control their daily life which really fit to them.
Moreover, we can watch the classes again and again when we want to review it.

Second, similarly with the first one, we can take the class anywhere.
It makes foreign students can participate to course at their country.
And also we don't have to waste our time to go to the real class.

If we can solve some communication lacks in the classes, then taking online lecture will be a good choice for above reasons.
We can expect that online courses will improve the efficiency of learning because it can penetrate the wall of time and places."	2.5	3	3.5	9
1257	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Before 2020, there are some college which let student take the online courses, however, after the outbreak of Covid-19, lots of college and university change their policy for student to take the online courses not to be infected. And I think that this change can be helpful not only for students, but for the professors.
 To begin with, in the online courses, I assert that we are able to watch the lecture whenever we want. Some classes are opened for the real time classes but others are pre-recorded lecture. These are very useful for students since they can watch the lecture whenever they want. In the regard the real time class, we should take a note so that we can review in the future but, if we miss some contents, we need to ask a question to professor or other classmates through the email or other ways, which can be annoying. However, in the aspect of the non-real time classes, we can re-watch the lecture what we missed so that we can fix them. Also, we can play the lecture in a multiplied speed which are very useful for saving the time.
 On top of that, online courses are very safe from infection. Actually, infection is caused by face-to-face talking or other activities which encompass the face-to-face lecture. Although we wear the mask, there could be a possibility to be infected. Also, even if there is no probability to be infected in the class, students who are in campus are dangerous from the threaten of the virus. Actually, it is not possible to wear a mask all day long in campus due to the uncomfort, which leads students to take off their mask when they eat, drink, or even break. However, students who take the online courses do not need to wear the mask because they take them in their home. Therefore, taking online classed are very safe not only for the students, but for the professor.
 To sum up, taking online courses indeed have the advantages against the face-to-face lecture in the Covid-19 situation as well as in the normal situation like watching the lecture whenever we want or lower the possibility to be infected. Also, if the quality of the online classes like quality of sound or video is nice, they must be better than offline lectures in college."	3.5	4	4	11.5

But They do not like online class, and ask returning their money. I also do not like online class, but I think taking online course also have advantages. The advantages are convenience, inexpensive, and variety. I will talk about these three advantages.
First advantage is convenience. If we take offline courses, we should move another class room after one class is over. But if we take online course, we can take all class in our desk. We don't need to move class room. So we can use our time efficiently.
Second advantage is inexpensive. Expect students whose home is near by school, most students should go to dormitory or rented room if they take offline course. And it cost a lot. If we take online class, we can remain in our home. And this make we can save our money.
Last advantage is variety. Offline course have a limit of media. But if we take online course, we can use variety media like video, VR, and so on. This mean online course can make class for students participated in. 
I don't think online class is the best way. But if we should take online course, we can find some advantages of taking online course. We can take convenience because we don't need to move class room. And because we can remain in our home, we can save our money. And last we can use variety media. If we positively use these advantages of taking online courses, we can get better grade.

1259	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think there is some advantages of taking online courses instead of offline courses.
First, I can take all of online courses in anywhere, like in my home, and some online courses, which are taken with non-live, I can take the courses in anytime. In the before of COVID-19 era, most of classes are taken in the campus, so I have to go to the specific classroom in the fixed time. For example, If I have a class in 9 AM, I have to wake up at least on 8:30, and go to the class until the class started. But, It is difficult to concentrate the class if I slept for a short time yesterday because of a huge amount of homework or the appointment with friends. So, I will not able to take the course well, and maybe I will get the lower grade that I expected. But the online courses may solve this kind of problem. In the 2020 spring semester, I took the linear algebra class in 9 AM, but I could watch the lecture videos anytime, anywhere. So, I watched the video when I wasn't tired, and I studied more deeply for it. I think that gives me more better grade.
Second, It prevents from the spreading of virus. This is the most important reason why almost of the college in Korea selected the online courses. There is a limit of wearing mask because just one people who put off his or her mask for a minute may spread the virus. the online courses is the most safe method to take the lecture in the COVID-19 era.
Third, A professor can prepare the course more efficiently instead of the offline course. I felt some classes in the high school is not efficient because teachers says some story not related with the subject. However, In the 2020 spring semester, some professor prepare the lecture video without any lack of information which are related with the course, but the length of the video is much shorter than the real class time. Moreover, the professor can prepare the real time Q&A Session like an offline class.
Even the online class has some fatal disadvantages in the exam or communication and so on, It is true it also has good points as I mentioned above. Also, We have to consider the post era of COVID-19. In my opinion, it will be good continuing some online courses like EDU 4.0 for the good points after the era."	2.5	4	3	9.5
1260	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" These days, almost every college changes their courses into online class because of COVID 19, and there are some arguments about online courses. Some people think that taking online courses in college can affect bad influences to college students because of they can't keep in tough with other students, and can't improve their friendship. However, I think taking online class in college is beneficial for students by two reasons.

  First of all, college students can use record from the online class to their study. When students listen offline lecture, it is difficult to write whole professor's saying and lecture information. They even get bad score because of forgetting some important information associate with exam or quiz. On the other hand, students or professors can record the lecture using some programs such as zoom when students take online courses in college. Students can fill information that they missed, and they can study that lecture repeatedly. Additionally, it finally leads students to get good grades.
  Next, college students can save time when they take online courses. In my friend's case, my friend's school was so far from his house, so he always took subway 3 hours to go his college. However, when college courses change into online class, he can sleep more in the morning. Thus, taking online class should gives students more free time which students use for another things such as their leisure time or sleeping or studying. In addition, it finally reduces student's stress, and makes them to participate actively to the online class.

  College students can use record from the online lecture, and can save their time to go to their colleges. Therefore, I think taking online courses in college are good for the students by these reasons."	4	4	4	12
1261	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change one thing about korea, I will change an education program of korea. Though many teachers and politician think hardly of this topic, but I think the policy of korean education is not that excellent.

There are 2 reasons that why I don't think korean education(I will call this KE) is perfect. So this reasons are the bad aspect of current KE.

First, KE is not that equal for every students. 

Though susi is very good policy, there are many problems in susi. for example, today's news, the reporter discover some child of politician cheats in susi to get a chance in good university.

Second, KE has so strict curriculum.

Today's KE has just two way that taught in school. Ikwa and Munkwa. But there are very many kinds of people, so I think students needs way more flexible education.

Maybe this is because to reduce a academy, but I don't think it is ultimate method to reduce academy.

In summary, I think reason1's key idea is about equality., reason2's is about strict of KE.

So how I can change KE to make them better. I want to suggest next two things(policys) to make KE better.

First, we have to increase percentage of suneung.

I think suneung is very good way that make equality of chances to everyone. Currennt KE has susi, but it can be used. But suneung, there are no probability to make a mistake or cheating. There are many cheating problems in susi.

Many teachers and politicians in korea point out that suneung can make korean academy more larger, but I think we can breakthrough this problem by using next second policy.

Second, we have to construct internet education lot more stronger in advanced education.

Concretly, we have to make internet suneung lecture and other advanced lecture(for example AP system or olympiad etc) on ebs which doesn't need some money.

It will help equality of education chance and make KE more flexible. Because students can choose more ways about their education.

Though advanced study can make students more harder, but we can breakthrough this by make advance study just optional, not must. Only the student who wants to participate advance study will take a advanced course, and it will make better this problem. 

In summary, give more percentage of suneung for equality, and make a internet lecture of seneung and advance lecture for make KE more flexible and decrease academy.

Though we apply this two policys, we can't have a perfect KE. But we can make KE more equal to everyone, and can have more flexible education program.

Thank you.

Therefore, the most important thing I would like to change is making my country become a developed country, especially in scientific. In a developed country, there are many of modern machines that help people's life, make them work easier, have a happy life and treat diseases. 

First, in algriculture with up-to-date technic, people can grow more rice, vegetables, fruits, etc. with less physical work. In addition, the product will be fresher, higher quanlity and cheaper, the products can be exported to foreign countries. People in my country still have to grow rice, watering vegetables and trees by their hands. That waste a lot of physical effort. 

Second, morden machine can help doctors diagnose diseases earlier, somes even can treat specific diseases without drugs. Nowaday, there are more and more new diseases. Lack of new technic leads to late of diagnosing and finding treatment. COVID 19 is a dangerous disease that make lots of people die and we need vacine for treatment. Obviously, we can not figure out the right vacine without developed scientific.

Finally, good machines can help protect our border from instruders both on land and sea. Absolutely, war machine is not good if we use it in wrong purpose, making war with other countries. However, they are really neccessary to defense the country from being attacked by the others. The more powerful and modern weapons, the higher security that the country can get. Once people in a country being safe, they can live a happy life and work effectively.

There are much more good things that we can have with a developed scientific. Therefore, I really want to develop my country firstly on this field."	3.5	3	2.5	9

It will be effective that regulating the excessive packing of products (like snacks, foods, ect.) and emission of fine dust and carbon dioxide.

 By doing so, many positive effects can be driven:

 First, doing like that is ethical thing.

 By the human activity of my country, the peaceful islands of the Pacific Ocean sink below the sea. Like this, the concidence the activity of us goes to the not realated people and next generations.  Someone said like this: the acted people and responsible people is not equivalent. So the improvement of environmental issue is the improvement of this non-ethic.

 Second, we can save money which will be needed to maintanance of land of my country. Trashes that can't be recycled are buried below land, and pollute the land. This land become not available. Like this, trash buring is loosing money and resources in long-term.

 The world can't be sustained with only people and their cities and towns. So I want to solve the issues by some laws."	3	2.5	2	7.5

But in our country, we don't have representive and famous festival. When we make significant festival, people get many advantages.

First, in most of the people get stress by the moving fastest environment, they can get rest that they don't think thier life but feel free.

So people can get out the stress. And it will take them to work efficiently before situation. According to one of the famous FSB, stress and the busy life is the reason for getting feel down.

But when they have a enough time to rest, they can change actively and efficiently. Actually, when l was high school student, l'm very tired to study. It becames bad situation that l don't want to do anything. Then my mom said you should get enough rest for you. So our family got trip. It taked me to feel better. So my score climbed by studying efficiently.

Second, our country's dollar situation can change more better. Because we can round the money by buying food, and selling. So it can be circular very well.

This core point is people's money move other's money to round. And for the more, it can save dollars by foreign traveller. Most of travellar travel several country to know their culture.

The country wide festival is the best choice for feeling country's specific things. Then many foriegn people come our country to play the festival, and it comes to save dollars.

Making big festival have many advantages for our country's growing.

For these reasons, feel fresh and save money, why i support that we have to make special festival that can represent our country. "	3	2.5	2.5	8
1265	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" If I could change one important thing about my country, I would change the education system of schools. Actually, many people have been think that there are a lot of problems about the education system of my country, but it has not been solved yet. Although a lot of solutions were tried to fix it, but I think it has not been solved. Although some people may think that the education system now is enough, I think it has to be developed more than now as following 3 reasons.

 First, the education system of Korea is not useful for students to think and determine their plans, future jobs, or visions, and so on. Since there are a lot of contents to study which may not be related with someone's plans, they have to spend a lot of time not to think their future jobs, but to understand and memorize the contents. I think the educational system has to give a lot of chances to think about their future plalns, since studying only is just running without the map and compass. Also, once they think and find their future plans, I think they can have more interest in studying, since they are running to goals which is determined by not teachers, but them.

 Second, the education system of Korea has not been encouraged to study thier major subject. When I was in science high school, I have to study deeply not only science and math, but also Korean, English, Korean history, and so on. I think it is necessary for our life, but I think those subject can be dealt in a university. I think the education system has to allowed to study and concentrate only their major at least in highschool, since determining their future is one of the most important thing in someone's life. 

 Lastly, there are a lot of academies, in Korean ""학원"", in my countries. A lot of students studies higher subjects early, for example, a lot of middle school students study high school math early. I think it is very serious problem, since it means that there are some weak points in our educational system, and we cannot go to academies without money. Some students may not be given some additional chances since they don't have enough money, and also it is not easy to go to both a school and academies for the other students. Therefore, I think the education system of school has to provide more subjects or additional studying system than now. If they provide a lot of high quality classes and studying system, a lot of students may rely on a school, not academies.

 I know that it is very hard to fix the education system, and it will take a lot of time and money. However, the education is very important to teenagers since it can affect students' future plans, which is related with our country's future. Therefore, I think a lot of people should think of this problem as the most important things. "	4	4	3.5	11.5
1266	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   If I could change one important thing about my country, I will change Suneung System (university ability test). In Korea, many high school students prepare this exam. And they have the purpose only high score about this exam. So, they are not exited in study, they are only exited in score, score.. Because I think it has many problems.

   First of all, there are some bad students in high school. Some students don't have good behavior in school, they don't play about school rule. And they also disturbance different sutdents to study. But these students in outschool study about Suneung, and they will go university.

   Second, students can have a mistake. In Suneung day, many students will be nervous, so they will have many mistakes. Because of this, some students who study hard have a mistake, they have low score in Suneung. They can't go university that they want.

   So, I think this Sunueng System will change. And I think they will take a test every month in high school life and the tests reflect in university score. This system can solve two problems."	3.5	3.5	3	10

"In summer, humidity and hot weather makes us exhausted. The best way to repel those harsh conditions is using air conditioner. Although it would be temporary but necessary. However expensive price of electricy makes us hard to use air conditioner well. Because electricy price system is akin to hierarchy. When we use more energy than assigned standard than the unit price becomes higher. If usage exceeds following assigned standard unit price becomes more higher. I think both increasing standard and lowering the unit price is necessary. and the potential deficit should be compensated by collecting more money from industry.

First, price of domestic electricy is expensive compared to OECD. And so did the price gap between phase is too large.  

Conclusion, For these reasons unit price of energy in higher phase should be decreased.

"Some people think that my country have to ensure social safety. Another people think country have to reduce tax. However,in my opinion, I think that my country have to enhance military power. There military power include any kind of military such as airforce or army.

The first reason is that if Korea want to achieve profit between other country, military force enhence is neccesary. Korea is located between China and America one is most powerful country in the world and other is second. Forthemore, China's policy is very scary since they want to stand on other coundtry. It is not different of America but it little bit over. If Korea don't have self-protecting force, it will be very nervous to control relationship. For example, Korea empire in 1900s collapsed. that didn't have enough power to protect itself, another country outbreak war in Korea. Even when Donghak nongmin army  which is consist with normal farmer against with goverment, goverment was help by japan. Finally empire collapsed.

Second, nowday S.Korea conflit with N.Korea. Korea war outbreaked in 1950s but war is not finish. N.korea have ready to make war. Some people  say N.korea lost any trantional threat. Nevertheless, they have enough ability to make confuse country foundmental economy, because of stragical weapon like uclear. For instance, N.korea shoot missile to seuol or industry area, there damage can't calculate. When one uclear missile among with many stragical weapon form N.korea strike seoul, S.Korea will get astronomical damage. So millitary force is very important to provent form war.

To sum up, Korea have to enhance Military force because achieve profit between strong country and prevent next Korea war. In this regard, I insist strongly about them.

1269	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If i could change one important thing about Korea, I'll change the constitutional law about the punishment. In Korea, lots of people always conplain about weak punishment. This is because. Nowadays, Korea's criminal law focus to change criminals, not punishment. So punishments in law are too weak than other countries. The other hand, some countries like USA focus to punishment,. have more strict punishments. They just make criminals to live hundreds years in jail. Of course they'll die in there before the period ends. In that countries, the law make criminals to spend their whole life in jail. I want to change constitutional law, to make criminal laws that way.
The reason why Korea chose changing-focused law is the belief of the posibility to change for people. Actually, I also agree that every people can be changed. and changing criminals is definetely better way if it works.  However, for changing, we need to a lot of time, effort, detail program and professional mental doctors. In jail, there is no enough resources. They just meet some priest, listen to boring lecture and do meaningless work. it's all of the nowadays changing program in jail. They cannot change in this weak circumstance. This fact is proved by lots of newspaper. From newspaper, we can easily find some articles about crime by person who did same thing and went to jail before. Our ways to change didn't work.
Therefore, just strong punishment is needed. People will feel too much pressure to do crime. Criminals cannot escape from the punishment and cannot do same thing again. This is the better way than meaningless changing program."	3	3	3	9
1270	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I live in Korea now. In here, I think almost everything is stable and okay. But I want to change some traditions and thinkings of this society. One of them is the thinking on natural science.
In Korea society, in these days, many people think natural science, like physics and mathematics, as hard-to-earn-job and trivial one. In other words, people think that if someone is major in natural science, then she will be hard to earn lots of money. because of these recognition on science, students want to go department of engineering or ohters rather than department of science. And sadly It is true that master or ph.D students in Korea get very low pay versus their higher ability.
 Scientists can't make a innovative result -like Einstein's theory- in short period. Aspecially In modern science, many theory and natural phenomena had been discovered in past. therefore now scientists go deeper and deeper to find new natural essence. because of the nature of modern science. in addition, to research a topic, sometimes scientists have to use giant scientific tool. to use it, they have to wait till their turn. It takes long time either. What I want to say is to make meaningful scientific result can't be achived in short time, because of the nature of modern science. However, now government wants scientists to make just one-year report. This report have some power to decide her aid-money from government. Because of this reality, scientists have trouble in making long-period project.
 I want to change this point. Government have to support many long-period research of natural science, regardless of their just one-year result. Then scientists can enjoy their resaerch and not worry for aid-money. And for same purposes, master or ph.D students have to get average pay at least. Some students say that they avoid joining lab after their graduate because of very low pay. If these problem solved, more students want to join lab and then natural science of Korea will be get higher level. Higher level of natural science means infinitive possibility for technology and engineering, beacause all engineering use facts that are based on science. So in other words, if all scientists lose their power to work then engineering developement would stop there. To be more well-granted future, natural science problems on this land have to be solved."	2	3	2.5	7.5

Furthermore, it has eco-friendly healing space, too. So, I love my country, Guri. Even though, it has also some disadvantages. What I want to change most among them is the subway system. For the first, there is only one subway line in Guri. Due to  this, there are many unconvenient things. For example, we cannot go some place in Seoul that that subway line do not go. Moreover, we cannot help to take more time to go some place in Seoul than using the car. On top of that, the time interval of subway is very long. So, when we miss the subway right before, we should wait more that 20 minutes. Because of this, I was often late for my time appointment with my friends.

1273	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  Many company leaders or high-level company members in Korea are doing their best to accomplish their jobs and get the highest revenues. But in the process of pursuing such achievements they often behave badly to their subordinates and hurts their emotion. They also often do not understand or forgive one-time mistake of the members in lower positions. This kind of behavior is one of many factors which degrades the morale of many employees in Korea and even gives a bad image about the country to many new-bies in Korea.

  Although I am currently not in a high position in any company, not even a company employee, I believe I can change such harsh environment of my country in the future. I am basically generous to anyone. I have not make revenge to anyone who directly or indirectly hurt me, but just tried to understand why they were hurting me and which aspects of mine caused such events. For example, when I was a 11-th grade student I had some senior students who behaves badly and sometimes gave insulting words to lower-grade students, including me. At first I did not understand why there doing in such way and felt a sad feeling about my destiny. But soon I realized that they were stressed out due to the preparation of the university entrance exam, so I decided not to care much about their actions. I am also able to quickly discharge the bad emotions and hatred arising in my mind. For example, I had a friend who once spreaded a false and bad information about me to his friends. I became really angry just after I noticed the incidence, but I did not fully express the anger to him. Instead, I decided to take a nap and within two hours I returned to my ordinary emotional state. As a result, there was no serious happening at the time; it just ended with a mild warning directed to my friend.

  Although my generous personality will not directly change my country, I believe that when I obtain a high position in a company many followers and colleagues will be affected by my behavior and then make gradual effects in the company, society, and the country."	2	3	4	9
1274	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I would like to change the education system if I could change one important thing in Korea. As a university student, I have experienced elementary school, middle school, high school education for 12 years. After I graduated high school, I thought that there are many problems in Korea's education.

 The first problem I faced in Korea's education was overheating of private education such as academy or individual lesson. Academy and individual lesson might be a good way to improve students' ability, but students may feel tired and get a lot of stress if the private education is overheated. I found that many of my friends were tired of overheated private education. Many students study in academy until 10pm because there is a law about the time. However, many academies have classes after 10pm. Even though the private education is tired, some passionate students might like it because they want to learn more. What I want to talk about is overheated private education is not appropriate for students who don't want to study that much and feeling a lot of stress. So I think overheating problem should be solved.

 The next problem is some Korea's education make students memorize even if they didn't understand, especially in academy. I think memorizing without understanding is meaningless. It might be effective for an exam, but students won't learn properly. Also it is more effective to learn other things if they understand before memorizing. For example, mathematics is frequently used in physics. If the student memorize the mathematics formula without understanding, the student might have trouble with using mathematics formula in physics problem. If I could make all the education systems teach properly, it would help the students study better.

 Previous problems occured because of the university admission problem. Education is overheated because all the students want to go to higher universities. How the university choose students does not matters. I think the diversity of university should be wider to solve this problem. Students should go to university which teach them what they want to learn. I think selecting university just because it is famous is not appropriate.

 For these reasons, I would like to change the education system in Korea. It might solve many problems and make students happier."	4	3.5	4	11.5
1275	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" What is the most important problem in our country, South Korea? As a one student of a KAIST, it is serious problem that attitude of common people to science, especially basic science.
  Since South Korea had been experiencing absolute poverty after 1950's war, they need money. Hence, they couldn't focus on basic science, for instance, physics, chemistry and mathmatics because we can get any product only when we input money to those. Of course, we reach the highest point in engineering and applied technology, popular companys prove this. However, we don't have original skill or basis to derive a advanced technology. It is a good example that Japan's regulation of the trade in 2020. Samsung cannot makes products although they are one of the best company in the world. After this, people noticed about how important basic science is.
  Saddly, even though that situation happened, people sitll not interested in this problem. One reason is that those are difficult, have low potential to earn money, and need to spend lots of time. When I can change this attitude, it is not just imagination that one get Novel prize from South Korea. To do that, the first step is increasing student who study baisc science. As China shows that, when the pool is large enough, the probability of a ratio of a smart student is increasing.
  How we attract students to basic science? one way is giving various rewards for those student., but it is too expensive to try. So, I recomand the the other way, it is what I do now. Showing the prejudice of the basic science is totally not true.
  As I mentioned, I think the reason students doesn't choose basic science as a major is they feel thoes are difficult. Therefore, they can change mindset when I prove it isn't. I'm not smart and not confident with my ability. But I have some beliefs that I can graduate and get Dr title when I do really hard. Then, I can expect others willing to enter basic science who are more smart than me."	3	3	3	9

It is too hard to learn foreign language. Although I love korean language, it cannot support me in global generation. I know that korean word Hangeul is very scientifically well-made words, it is not helpful to learn foreign words. If other countries also used Hangeul and korean language, it would be better to communicate with foreign people, and I want to be like this more. But the question is 'If i can change in ""MY"" country', so I want my country's language to be English so that I can communicate with foreign people more easily.

I think there is no reason to change about my country except that reason. Korea is very good country to live. Compare with other developed country, my country has high-technology in internet, so I can watch youtube without any buffering. And my mother language is very easy to learn, so most of people in my country can read and write their words. Also, social infra is very stable so that we can live without worry about big crimminal. But many people in my country are hard to communicate with foreign people. If it is hard to change my mother language to English, I want to change my country's English learning system.

As I said, I love my mother language too, and many people in Korea are very sooth with Hangeul and Korean. So I think changing Korean to English can might be too hard. But If I change Korean English learning system, the problem will be solved. In Korea, we learn English by listening and reading. But it isn't helpful for me to communicate with foreign people. If the Korean English learning system would be changed to focus on student's speaking and writing skills, it can be helpful to communicate with foreign people. Then, I think many skilled Koreans can be more respected in these global generation."	3	3	3	9
1277	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"There are various things and systems to construct and maintain our country. I am satisfied with my country, but if I could change one important thing about my country, I would like to change education system a little bit. In this case, our education system means every student in Korea have to study a lot to during middle school and high school to go university and all students think that they have to go university. If not, it looks 'fail'.

First, I think all students don't have to go college or university. Because all students have thier own ability about different thing. But during middle school and high school life, students get streesed highly because they study for admit university even though their major doesn't need university knowledge a lot. For example, in other country, they feel free to study more, or to get a job after graduate high school and it doesn't matter or more helpful for getting job when they become adult.

Also, even though there are some high school for study deeply about their job (for example, major in beauty, hair-styling, animation, design), it really doesn't work well now. For now, some of students are entering those high school for avoid studying, not for major or study about job. I think it should be change that those schools are just for student who really major in, and we need other system for students who doesn't have any interests.

That's why I think our education system should change a little bit for our students. If it changes, it will make better society for everyone."	3	3	3.5	9.5

For now days, politician made and change law about educatioin. They could change the contents that students will learn, or change the test system.

So we could see many changes when we had election and new politician appears. But I think it is a big problem of our country.

The important point about this problem is that politician didn't have high level knowledge about education. But politician sometimes came out with some promises for people's supprot or just recommend people who are related with them, not a excellent expert on education planning field. Through there are better expert on education field, politician hired other people. And this point makes some problem in education system. 

Other reason we have to seperate politics and education is that politician changed education system too often. Politician have their working-years that normally 4years. So without considering education quallity and students situation, they just bring some sensetive topic and want to raise supporting rate. 

Education has to be long-term. We have to observe for a long time and fix them if there is a problem. Also, education determined our country's level in the future. So it is really important part to raise students well. From these reasons, I want to change system about education. "	3	2	3	8

"There are a few things I would like to change about this country now, but what I think is most important is the death penalty. These days, many big and small events are happening everywhere.

First, not all cases come out like that, but the examples on the news make the viewer angry through irrational and unethical behavior. In particular, social distance keeping is being implemented due to Covid19, and seeing them hold rallies on the streets and worship in churches, I think the Korean law is very weak. Not legally or even with the paper they collect goes God that a minister going on and on agitated people, to gather.

Second, I do not agree with the opinion that the human rights of criminals should be protected. It is strange to say that violence cannot be justified for any reason. Even the law of self-defense right now allows violence to the extent that many people feel reasonable. In 2008, there was an incident called the Cho Doo-soon case, he raped and assaulted an eight-year-old girl. The shock still has a severe trauma to the girl. The Cho Doo-soon is awaiting release from prison this December. There are also many other crimes, and it is still questionable whether these people should be allowed to live in prison or in society by using taxes.

For this two reason, I think we should revive the death penalty in our country."	2	3	3	8

It is that Other country's people say about Korean rapid economical developement. The word 'Miracle' shows that the developement was unbelievable. What could make the miracle is a personality of Korean people. 'faster and faster'. Korean people can't afford to work slow and like living faster. They want to achieve their goal faster than others. That made the miracle, the rapid developement, however now a day that make people to be nervous and aggressive. I found the personality of Korean people make our country to live with more stress. If I could, I want to change the personality of Korean people's personality. 

 First, 'faster and faster' make Korean people to be nervous. A person has own special personality, favor and talent. he is different from other people. So that, they will make different ways of life. One people can achieve their goal fast, and other can do slow. However, the bad personality makes a pressure to others to do it fast. It makes people nervous, and nervous people can not do their own 100% work. 

 Second, the personality make them to be aggressive.       ~

                                                                         

 There was a experiment with rats. They separate two groups of rats. The first one was feel free to live in the cage and they killed a rat with electronic shock by an hour on the other group of rats. Rats of the team who has attacked were going to be aggressive and even attacked other rats around. Then the stress made all rats die in attacked team while another team's rats were live safely. Now a day Korea has become enough strong country. It is good to become more strong and developed country, however I think it is more important to become a country which people want to live in, give them comfort. To become a that country, 'faster and faster' must be deleted from Korean people, and 'slow is also Okay' should be in their mind.

So many people don't want to think deeply. We're paying too much cost trying not to think, or be more reasonable.

And this, is the exact part that I want to change.

If people get to think more deeply, the consious level of the country will increase.

And habit of thinking will improve all part of my country. (For example, academic accomplishment, productivity, culture level, ....)

"  Since Republic of Korea(as known as South Korea) is established, the capital is always Seoul. Seoul is a nice city that is near to a sea, has a large river and ground.

For this reason, the capital of Joseon is also Seoul. But, I think that we should move the capital to down, like Sejong-si, or Daejeon.

  First, after Korean War, we stop fighting against North Korea on about 38 degree line. This line is too close to defense our capital. The distance from the line to Seoul is less than 40km.

So, I don't want that it happens, but if the war start again North Korea can shoot the capital with only canon, and invade on ground on short time. This is different point that the capital of North Korea

is Pyeongyang that is very far from the line. Even though our military power is 9~10th country of world, we can easily be attacked. Think that the capital is moved temporarily to Busan on Korea War.

  Second, the price of house and ground is too expensive to buy. Almost 50% Korean are living on Seoul and Gyeonggi-do. This happens becase the convienience of Seoul is beyond other cities.

If we move government buildings to other cities and core buildings, we can get a distributed effect on people and the price. Also, we can develop other ground on Korea, making new construction labors.

  I know that one of the previous presidents do similar policy but it cannot be done easily, and the result is Sejong-si. But, recently thinking the government make on effort to reduce the price of house,

I'm sure that more aggressive policy like this is needed."	3.5	3.5	3	10

 Second, we can communicate easily with foreign people. The easier communication would promote the collaboration with other country. And the collaboration would improve the study, company, literature, art, etc. We can enjoy the better quility of many things.

 Finally, we can go traveling more comfortablely. There are lots of uncomfortable things because of the difference of the language. If we can't speak foreign language, we need the translation machine or guide. However, if the languages that used in other country and my country are same, we wouldn't need them.

 I want to change policy about education. In my country, students should study all day long especially high school student. So, student always tired to study and get good grade. In my experiecnce, When I was high school student, I should study very hard to enter good university, and I always had stress about grade and competition. I think one of the best problem about korean education is grade competition. In korea, there are two main method to enter university, susi (by school grade) and korea SAT. Both procedure have competion between student. these competion compels people to the extreme. Some people argue that competion makes student study harder, and students have good abillity. I agree with that comperition is easy method to get student to study, but I think that to study comfortably is better than stressfully in aspect to student health and well-fare. Moreover, There are many ways to let student study without competiotion. For example, student may have interest about study when they study with activities or experiences. So, competiotion isn't good way. 

 I think duty of school is to find student's talent , to strengthen it , and to encourage their dream. But In korea education, It seems like acadamy to send student to good university. Education is really importatnt, becasuse It determine person's life and futher, future of country. So, We need effort to change policy about education. for student and futher. "	3	3	3	9

"I want to change that Korea man can choice whether they go to army. This is three reasons. First, some men does not proper army on psychlogic and physical. Korea think important to free. But Korea does not respect to man's decision making. So, I think my country should respect man's decision making. Second, man go to army very early. In Korea, most man go to army when theay are from 21 to 23. So, men lose their young time during 18 months. I think that it is unreasonable. Third, Reward that man go to the army is so few. When people go to army, they experience hard training and live lack facilities. But they get lower than minimum wage beause it is obligation. It is unreasonable. Although people naturally think man must go to army. It is bad tradition.

Next I told how change that the man can go to army. First, the man can choice whether they go to army. It makes proble that Korea's national defense is lower than before. But, relatively, Korea has stronger national defense than other simliar country. Moreover, if relation is improve between north korea and south korea, south korea don't need stronger national defense to restrict man's freedom. So south korea try to close to north korea. Second, I think man that go to army get more reward and army's facilities need to improvement.  I consider army's difficult thing, I think the man get to minimum wage at least. And I think  army's facilities more improve because people can overcome hard training every day in army. 

Until now, I consist Korea man can choice whether they go to army and explain how change that the man can go to army. For this reason, Korea should make method that army's environment is improve and give choice to man whether they go to army. Thank for reading my writing."	3	3	2	8

"When I was young, I really want to be a scientist. Scientist in SF movies were very clever and wonderful. But recently, I get a big question about my life, ""It is fine for me to be a scientist?"" I think that Korean people don't recognize how science is important. Korean government don't investigate to science well, they decreased budget which is planning to investigate to science, and they said ""Why Korean people can't recieve Novel Prize?""

So, I think Korean government should investigate more resource to develop science. There is a saying, 'If you major Physics or Mathematics in college, you will be starve or run a chicken restaurant.' Nowaday, most of people think that scientists can't earn money well, and this is true. Most of company don't need to employ physicians or Mathematicians, and science laps which run by government are too small. So lots of scientists can't earn money well. I think it is a big damage to our country, so I want to change this situation.

Nowaday, a lot of people who major Physics or Mathematics employed by a academy, in Korean ""Hakwon"". It's because they don't have any opportunity to earn money without this method. So, first, I will make lots of science lap to employ scientists. If they can get a job easily, they don't have to go daechidong, which has so many 'hakwon'. And they can also research about their interest well. So I think this policy can improve the quality of research a lot.

Second, I will give much money to scientists. In Korea, so many students study hard to be a doctor. It's because doctors can get a lot of money in Korea. So I think that if scientists get a lot of money, students will be study hard to be a scientist, and we can get a lot of scientist. More and more people want to be a scientist, the quality of research is also improved. So I think it is also a great policy to improve the science.

To summarized this topic, I think our government don't investigate science a lot, so I want to investigate lots of resource to improve science by running more science laps and giving much money to scientists. I think this policies are very great ideas to improve our science and technologies. If I will be a administer of department of a science and technologies or a president, I will do this policies and I

"There are a lot of countrys and also there are a lot of languages. U.K and U.S use English, China uses Chinese, Japan uses Japanese and Korea uses Korean. As the English is the global use language, I think, this fact makes huge difficulties for us. So I would like to change the language of our country from Korean to English. I will explain why I want to change the language in two different reasons.

 First, it is hard to communicate with another countries people or need big money to speak well as our main language is Korean. As our main language is Korean and the education of English is focused on memorizing, a lot of people are feeling hard to talk with foreigner people because we didn't learn how to speak in school. If someone want to speak English well, then they need to go abroad to learn how to speak English with living in the English using country as United State or U.K. It takes a lot of money so it is very hard to normal people. In my case, when I was in middle and high school, there was foreigner teacher in my school. But I thought that I am not good at speak in English well thus I was afraid of the foreigner class time. Also, In now days, I feel afraid when I talk with foreigner persons. If my main language was English, I would talk well with foreigner persons.

 Second, we are missing many chances because out main language is not the English. The Korea is very small market. So if someone only can do Korean and cannot speak in English, he cannot go into tremendous global market. There are 7 billion person in the world and the global language is English. As our main language is not English, It is hard to go into huge market and target to the world, and we miss many chances in global market. Although someone can speak English, his main language is not the English so it may have some differences with English country people. So there would some wall between our services and global persons. If our main language was English, everyone in Korea would speak English well and could think not only Korea which is small market but also all the Earth which is huge global market as the target for new idea and make the service very easily. 

For these two reasons, I think that if I could change on important thing about my country, I would like to change the language of Korea from Korean to English. "	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

We can take a car, taxi, bus, subway, or else. Each ways has many advantages and disadvantages. Taxi is fast but expansive, bus is slow. I think the subway is good public transportation. Subway doesn't have traffic jam. It usually comes on time. Also, it isn't expansive.

But, in my country, Gwangju in Korea, there is just one subway line. It is hard to use subway to go somewhere. Actually, I have never used the subway in Gwangju. Most of my friends, too. I only use the subway when I go to the Seoul. Since I used a subway for the first time in my life in Seoul, it is really shocked. There are a lot of subway lines, so I can go anywhere in Seoul by subway! It is really good. At that time, I wished there was a lot of subway lines in Gwangju.

So, I want to make many subway lines in many cities in Korea. There are always traffic jam in morning and evening. Most of people use a car or taxi to go to a job or come back to house. Traffic jam will be better if there are many subway lines in the city. In addition, using subway is cheaper than using a car. We can save our money, and solve the traffic jam problem.

It can solve not only traffic jam but also the environment problem. Main source of the air pollution is the car. Subway can reduce the use of car, and it will make the air clearly. It is really good, isn't it?

For these reasons, if I could change one important thing about my country, I would make many subway lines in most of cities in Korea. It is the clue of traffic jam and air pollution in Korea. I hope to make a lot of subways in Korea as soon as possible.

 So, What are the problems of the contemporary education policy of this country and how to solve them?

Firstly, Unification of education will be the problem. there are many kind of scools in Korea, like science highschool, foreign language highschool etc. The purpose of these school is finding and raising students that have talent or gift for specific part. I think it is not enough. We have to make many different kind of schools like cooking, military, or raising firefighter... etc in many part of our lives. Raising experts from young age is important. As you can notice of the examples of Heung-min Son or Kang-in Lee, if we raise the experts from young age, it will increase our quality of life, proud of their jobs. Thesedays, many people claimed that some students from the special purpose school have greater opportunity to go to university and that is not fair. I think it is not good idea. I will discuss it in second reason. 

Secondly, stereotype that we have to go to university to get a job is the problem. Many people in Korea think that studying math, English, Korean etc. and go nice university is the only way to have successful life. And many people think job have kind of Rank. This kind of stereotype is very bad for deveoping country. In this country, there are many industries and many young men want to have some specific jobs. So they say ""Getting a job is very hard"" but, some kind of job have lack of people to work. (In Korean, we call it 3D works). I saw the statistics from some newspaper of the rate of going to university in Korea is about 70percent. It is much larger than any other OECD countries. In one side, it will gonna show how Koreans have focused of the education of their childrens. But in another side, quality of the lecture in the university can be lowered and we already know that many people in this country thinks university is just the tool to get a great job. I think we have to make the cognition that 'university is the place that if we want to study more about it and go'. To make this cognition, I will remake the system of school that raise the young people who has gift of some object in  different school, different way to teach. 

 it will be radical and very hard to change the people's think immediately by change one thing in the Korea, however I think it will change their mind slowly by change step by step."	4	3.5	3.5	11

It cuases inflation of grain, meat etc. Finally, the econmy is going to bad.

Second, there will be too much mess in cities like traffic jam, excessive increasing land price caused by much demand.

Regardless of our try, many policies should have the disadvatages and nagative effect. If I could change one important thing about my country, I would like to rebuild our education course.

 First, our education system makes our talent can't find out. During I live in Korea, I have felt our education was not flexible. From elementary school to high school all of the student study same thing like mathematics, Korean, English although they don't want them. There must be the students who have a talent without studying those things. Thus, our education system makes the wasted and missing talents.

 Second, they make too much competive. As I know the parents in seoul started takeing study in 4-years. At that time 4-years children already have a competition and these competition continue when we are in society. However, if there are many competition, somebody will be a winner and the other will be a loser. These competition when start at 4-years makes uncountable loser and they loss their confidence and will.

 In conclusion, I want to change our education. Because Korean education system have a important problem that can't find out our talent and too much competive. Also, our education should be to choose their own ways and to make their life themselves.

 Most of Korean students say ""I'm not happy"". I also have bad memories more than good memories about my past student life. Main reason of bad memories is study. Many people say that study is duty of students. But do they have to study despite to get many stress? Because of this reason, I think that we have to consider education system of Korea. 

 Korean education system push students to highly competative environment. Students have total 4 tests in a year. With that test results, students are ranked. Most of students do their best to get high rank in the test. Because their parents, teacher and education system want that. Compatition with others is exhausted job. Students always do compatition while they graduate. Thus, we have to think about less-compatition education system. 

 Most of students have no vision for their life. So, they just study with no specific goal for life. Life vision is very important for their happy life. But Korean education system does not give enough time for searching life vision. Students have to use more time for searching life vision rather than studying

 There is not enough vararity for education. People are have different gift. To efficiently use their gift, Korean education system has to be varied. 

 I think final goal of life is happiness. To find happiness, we have to give more time to students to find what they want to do. Just studying is not the answer.

So, politics is the most important thing I would like to change in this country.

In Thailand, people especially students and teenagers have no rights to speak up the truth such as critical comments on government and dynasty. If any one of them make some criticism on the dynasty, even if it is the fact supported by several evidences, they would be punish by the laws article 112 or 116. In other words, this means people in this country do not have any rights to speak up the truth, which should be the basic human rights. Therefore, If I could change one thing in my country, I would like to change the monarchy and political system.

Currently, the situation in my country is that there are mobs consisting mostly students protesting against the government and dictatorship to call out for their democracy and human rights. However, as a dictatorship country, the mobs leader got arrested by the police, an occupation which is said to be servants of people.

In fact, my family use lunar calendar to congratulate birthday, so It is quite often that me or my parents don't know that today is (lunar) birthday.

And their are also other confusing things. In my country, Korea, have holidays such as Seolnal and Chuseok. As those holidays use lunar calendar while other holidays such as Hangeulnal use solar calendar, we should find our calendar to see when is the holiday. Those holidays changes every year, so it is also uncomfortable to know when is the holiday. But I sometimes think it is funny to check holidays because sometimes two or more holidays are continuous so that we can rest quite long.

Actually, our ancestors used lunar calendar because it is helpful for farming. But I think it is not necessary because it is easy to check weather through weather forecast. And many farmers use greenhouses. Actually, my father is a farmer and he doesn't rely on lunar calendar for farming. Also, most of young children may not know what is Gyeongchip, or what is Malbok. This is the evidence of the fact that we don't need lunar calendar todays.

Some people might think lunar calendar is culture that our ancestors used. But i think it is not comfortable. I don't want to destroy all the thing related to lunar calendar. I just want to redefine holidays with solar calendar, which we use in real life. 

When we calculate science problems, it is really hard to calculate with mile, pound, or gallon... Those are not SI Units and we(Korean, not American) are not familiar with those units. It's same for foreigners to use lunar calendar. We should fix our calendar so that many people who don't know lunar calendar can know and enjoy Korean holiday all together.

we live in our country with many people, not alone. So we should obey the rules. For example, we have some law to protect our personal life. But i think that the law cannot protect all of problem which can occur in our public life. So there are implicit rules of conscience. For example, we must do not throw trash without permission. Because that trash can trigger serious environmental pollution. Also, we should be quiet when we are in public place. Because if we are noisy, people can be damaged. Like this, there are some important implicit rule even though  this rule is not specified in the law. But are people following this rule well? I can say no. For example, when we walk the street, there are so many trash anywhere and that makes the viewers frown. In the public park, there are so many trash so we can not play well. Not only this, but it can occur serious air pollution. In actually, pollution problem is issue in all country. And some cafe or sotre use so many disposable thing. Disposable thing is one time using product so it can effect bad to our environment. Actually, more and more animal which live in forest can die becasue of unnecessary trash. we must prevent this problem together. So I want change this mind of people that ‘we can trash anywhere’. Even it is little uncomfortable, we must trash in the trash can. And we should do recycling and less using disposable thing. If our people do this well, we can prevent pollution problem. For do this well, people have to change their own’s mind first.

First, It's not famous. Only two countrys use korean and many of people in earth don't know about it. So we have to learn other languages to talk with other country's people. But people who use english, chiness and 불어, can use their languange in other countries. Because these languages are famous and a lot of people using. If my country's language is changed english or other, It will be more comfortable to live in this world.

Second, It's very rare that korean is used main language. Almost world contests use english or other language as main. So if we want to join contest, we must change our document language. It's hard work. And also if the document is poem or book, we can't show our feel very well. Because some feeling is only showed by korean such as '한', '하이얗게 폈다'. For example, korean is able to write a word in lot's ways. Yellow is in english is just 'yellow', but, in korean '노랗다', '누렇다', '누르죽죽하다', '샛노

" There are so many essential things that build the country. Government, Economy, Military and more things like that are such things. All of them seem to be working well, but if I have to choose just one flawed things, then I will pick the problem of military for two reasons.

 First, Only Men have duty for guarding country, and they do not get any reward for it. Age from 20 to 30, the gold period, is important and joyful for every men and women. However, all korean men have to spend one-to-five of their 20s time for the whole country. It is honor to save our family and citizens, but they cannot get any meaningful rewards for them. If I can chage the military system of my country, I will change it for men to get more meaningful rewards like extra points on the public exam.

 Second, some part of the life in the army are not follow human rights, and they are strictly prohibited to be spoken in society. There were so many cases including crime due to irregularities in the army. It can be so dangerous for irregularities like bullying in army, because one can handle really dangerous weapons in there. However, It still continues even nowadays, and I can hear some voices that complain about the irregularities from my friends who already get in to army. If I can re-rule the military of my country, I will clearly open it to society so one can watch what is going on the army right now.

 To summarize, I will change the military system of my country for reward system and irregularities. Solving these two problems will makes army happier and stronger."	3.5	4	3	10.5

If I could change one thing, then I would want to change this 'work-at night' culture. There're several reasons. First, work-at night can make personal health bad. Someone who did work-at night probably get much stress, because he or she had less time to sleep. Stress is basis of every healths' problems. Second, that can make less effiiciency

"In 2020, South Korea become one of strongest country in the world, with it's eletcronics, IT technology. Samsung and LG can make the best semiconductor and smart phones today, but specially Korea is weak in pure science; no Korean Novel/Fields medalist yet. Many of the science highschool student select medical university instead of pure science. Some people says they betraied the country. But I think the real problem is, government's investment about pure science is not enough. Almost everybody in science highschool loves science, but they choose medical university because becoming scientist/mathematician takes a lot of financial risk to entire life. In fact, treatment of graduate school student is very bad in Korea. Even there is a meme about Artificial Intelligence which costs 250 million won and works 1,000 times faster than normal human, but it is cheaper when we use 1,000 graduate school student. So it is trivial that no Novel prize/Fields medalist come from Korea. I think government have to remember pure science studies is for faraway-future technology. If it is not useful now, then it will be useful somedays. In example, the pure science studies about computation and algorithms in 1950~1980 leads today's company make AI. Also pure science itself is very important because it is finding the truth of university, like the mankind always did until today. So I want our country change to which every students who loves science can freely study their science without risking financial problem about their life."	3	2	3	8

 because of gender issue, korea have the lowest birth rate in un country. it makes korea dont have any potential anymore. and also other examples make korea that people dont want to live.

" Korea is one of the nice countries in the world, and it is good to live in Korea. But there is also many problems in Korea right now. And If I could change the most important one, I will change the school entrance structure which can be explained as Suneung. There is some reason, and I'll explain them.

 First, in this process like this, the students can't make there own dream come true. In this progress, Suneung is described as the only way to suceed and the other way needs a lot of luck, so students study only for Suneung because of their parents, teachers, and other people like them. So there is no chance for students to find and decide what is the best way for each student, and this make many social problem.

 Next, because students need to study for Suneung, the happiness of students is get more lower. For many students, studying is not that exciting thing. So they get stress because of studying. Of course this stress can be removed for some activities like game, sports, etc. But in Korea, these activities are thought as bad thing. So there is no way for students release their stress.

 Last, studying for Suneung makes the students get bad health condition. Because they want to get the best grade, they study for a long time. Students go to school, and after school they go academy or self-studying until late night. So students get sleep almost 1-2 a.m. or more late time. And this make students get less sleep, and this makes get less healthier.

 Of course their is a lot of problem in Korea, and each person has different opinion about this problem. And I also think these problems cannot be solved as each other. But I think, because I was student, this problem is important for students. In long way, this will affect for Korea's developement. So, this problem need to be solved as fast as possible.

So I want to change entrance examination system in my country. There are two reasons why I want to change this.

 First, many people use too much effort to go university. For example, in Seoul parents go to academy at 6:00am to get front line of academy for their son or daughter.

In addition, they use too much money for studying too. Because of situation that compete with others, some students go academy because not for studying but others go.

I think we can use that effort and money for happiness of family.

 Second, there are many accident that students suicide themselves because of studying. In case of my highschool, a student suicided himself because of his grade at past.

Moreover South Korea is the country that students suicide most but many people tend this is not serious.

 Because of these two reason I think I want to change entrance examination system in my country. Students are not just studying machine. They have to be happy and get

First of all, there are too many cars near my home. I live in Gangseogu, Seoul, where road is too narrow. But there are many apartments and houses so too many cars drive narrow roads. So we must change our road size or make more roads.

Second, traffic lights are something wrong. I already said there are too many cars. So if you want to across the road, you need traffic lights. It make loss accidents. But, in my country, there are few traffic lights. It's dangerous to elder people and young children.

Third, people ride bicycles in the human's road. By the law, if you ride bicycle you must ride on car's road. But there are too many cars in narrow roads, so people ride bicycle in the human's road. So we need bicycle's road near our houses.

korea(my country)'s school exam has short time limit and a lot of problem thing. i will change that long time(1.5~2.5hour) and a few problem thing(3~6). 

now, i'm gonna explain why. 

if school exam has short time and a lot of problem, what important to get a high score is solve the many problem and practice only. thinking independantly and think flexability is less important. so most student study a lot of book and solve the many typical problem with a unsouled mind.  that makes student get tired then student never injoy the study and also think deeply. that is very bad for student. 

rich parents spend a lot of money for their child to get a high score. that is natural. but spend a money to indiviual academy which force to solve many typical problem and make their child to hate study and dumb adult is not good. it is not good for their money and their child and our country's power in long term sight.

rich people's money shoud used to country's power and korean's happiness that concloud rich person's child too. that is efficent and right way to run the country.

 First, environmental issues become more and more serious these days. We have been struggled with heavy rains and typoons which are the result of climate change this year. To reduce climate change, we need to introduce new environmental policy. One of them is the environmental tax.

 Second, previous environmental policies are not effective. They just recommend the company to reduce to produce polllutants. Many companies still produce lots of pollutants because previous environmental policies cannot influence their business.  

 Consequently, to charge the environmental tax by changing environmetal policy is what I want to change if I could change one important thing about my country. Because of  environmental issues and previous uneffective environmental policy. By doing this, we can save our country.

 First of all, I think it can hurt student's health. Because of too many competitions, students have to do many things. So, they reduce their sleeping or resting time, and study. Also, many of my friends drank lots of energy drink or coffee to awake from sleeping. I think it can hurt their health a lot. I also experienced it in my high school time, and it hurted my health in fact. I don't want that many students being hurt by lots of tasks.

 Second, there are other countries that do creative activities in their learning time instead of just studying, such as USA. For me, I graduated science high school, so I could experience many experiment in there. So, I satisfied with that. However, there are much more general high schools. And I know their life in general high school, and it was boring. So, I think we should reduce competitions and increase creative activities for many students. I think it can help students developing and it can also make Korea more stronger. 

 Finally, I think reducing competition and doing creative activities can help many students to be a creative and smart person, and maybe it can develop our country. I think its's better than before, but we need more effort to change it. I hope that I can meet more better country later.

"Most of us don't know, but Korea is strong country. People don't recognize it because three huge nations are surrounding us. Thay are China, Japen, and Russia. Although they are more powerful then us, it doesn't mean that korea is weak nation. Out nation is small but it has huge amount of economic size. It means Korea is wealthy.

According to these facts, Korea is strong and wealthy country. But it doesn't mean that people in korea are satisfied in their nation. In fact, there are too many problems in this small nation. Huge distancce between normal personal and wealthy person, only huge company can survive, etc. To know why these problems are produced, we have to know our latest history.

During 1910 to 1945, Japan ate out nation and did a lot of bad things. They use their military force to get out nation's wealth. Because of them, korean nation lose a lot of money, grain, and young ang healthy people to support japan's war. Korean don't wanted this situation. Although our nation become official country again, we're economic situation was terrible. So government forced us to raise only huge company, which can raise GDP easily. It is the best way to raise GDP, but normal person can not feel this beacuse only huge company get all the money. It cause distance between normal person and wealthy person larger and small company san't survive easily.

If we can change this system, we can overcome these problems. We have to raise small size company. They can provide a lot of creativity to our market, and they can provide money to normal person. It can cause distance between wealthy person and normal person shorter. But it doesn't mean that our government have to just pour money to young CEO's. Just pouring money can cause a bad situation, such as ""Make imitation company to get money from government"". To avoid this situation, I prefer take less tax from making company and own their system. It can encourage people to make small company. If I can change country, I will do that."	3.5	3	3	9.5

I think my students in Korea have same experience with me. Also, the students in middle school and high school are studying really hard. Some middle school students study because they want to go to the special high school like english-high school or science-high school. In addition, all high school students study because of university. However, The number of special high school students and number of university students are limited. So All students don't go to the school or university that they want to go. If I could change one important thing about my country, I want to change the education system. There are two reasons.

     I want to make a new education system that all students can go to school and university that they want to go. The reason is that students in Korea get stress so much because of their score. In my opinion, the score is not all of the students. But, some adults think that students have to study, and if they get worse score, It's because the students don't study hard. Like this case, adults and parents always say 'you have to study' to their kids and students. So many of them get stress and they become that they hate studying.

     There is a new education system that all students can do something about their dream and something that they want to do. Because of the studying, students can not do something that they really want to do. Studying is important, but doing some activities for students' future is also necessary. Students can get some special experience by going to school and doing school activity like some club. For example, student do the school club about his dream very hard. And then the student get a job which is related the club and his dream when he become a adult. 

     In conclusion, If I can change something about my country, I will change the education system. I will make students can go to school and university which they want to go, and I will change that students can do many activity in their school life. The reason is that students get so many stress about studying and university-test and students have to do some activity that they can experience only in the school life. With these reasons, I want to change the education system, so I want students study more comfortablely."	4	3.5	3.5	11

Most people in KAIST studied very hard in thier highschool. I also spent my highschool ages studying for university. But what I feel in KAIST is that my highschool education is not so important in university.

I know that person who studeid hard in their highschool and did well on their own highschool may do well on university too. But I don’t think that  going to university and did well on there is not the reason of education.

Teaching math formula is education. Reading and speaking English is education. But helping students to find their road to mange their life is important too.. But in Korean education system, this important third part of education is missing. Many of my friends don’t know what they like, what they interested in, and what person they want to do. They just chose their university based on their school grades. Do you think just going to good university and spending their life studing knowledge that they don’t want to do? Absolutely not. During school period, education act like “Life Indicator”. Many students do not know about future careeer because they are young. It’s very normal. Education’s important role is running with students who are running to their adult ages and give them information about many of roads they can go.

I met my life’s teacher in highschool. In her first class, she told us Robert Frost’s poem, “The Road Not Take”. This was peom about choice in life. She told us that choice in highschool is important and we will walk different life due to those choices. And during this semester, she teaches us that we should think what person we want to be, what we like and what we know about life. When I were going through hard moments, she give me a warm words to courage me. I can’t forget all words she gave to me. I can say that my life became different after meeting her. I learned life thanks to her. 

There were many teachers who give me knowledge of math, science, English. But I learned the biggest thing, life through her. But  there in Korean education system, teaching to going to university is more important than teaching about life. I think we can study more and more through studying not just math or science, but studying life. This is what I want to change in Korea."	4	3.5	3.5	11

First, I think good listening is one of the qualities of a good friend. Friends who don't listen to other friends always be alone in my experience because they are often selfish. Otherwise friends who listen to other friends well always have many friends. 

Second, meeting often is one of the qualities because although very friendly friends can be unfamiliar when they don't meet long time. There is one friend when I was 12. He went to Japan to study at 13 and he call me some days ago. We were very friendly when we was 12, but now we are unfamiliar because of 8 years that we didn't meet. To be a good friend, we have to meet often.

Third, same hobby is also one of the qualities. When I was high school student, I can speak with any friends about study or college, but now only friends who have same hobby(playing computer game, soccer, or badminton) meet often. After I graduate high school, there is no thing to speak with friends who doens't have same hobby except for 'How are you'.

Finally, controlling anger is one of the qualites. Sometimes I see other friends avoid friend who doesn't controll anger. I think we need some anger for good relation but too many anger make other friends avoid him.

So I think good listening, meeting often, same hobby, and controlling anger are qualities of a good friend."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1322	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    In my opinion, good friends can be defined as a people who can help me when I have mentally or physically problems. We always have a problems that can not be solved easily, and I think good friends can help us. There are so many methods to help others like listening his or her talking carefully, calling each other often. I want to suggest this qualities as a condition of good friends. 

    For the first quality, listening his or her talking very carefully and giving a suggestion. In my case, I have very good freind, and I always call or chat him when I have problems. For example, when I was very difficult to adjust myself in highschool at the begining of the first semester, he listen my concern very carefully, and tell me to have a confidence. He suggested me to play sports with new classmates, and I can get friends easily during playing soccer, and basketball. Like this case, when someone just listen my problems seriously, it can be very helpful for me . So, I think quality is important as a good friend.

    Second one is calling or sending a message often. I think, when people don't message or call often, relationship between them become weak. If you are like me, maybe you do not call most of your middle school friends, and this behavior make our phycologic distance with them far. When you have to call them in any reason, you probably feel awkward to message. So, to keep a relationship and left as a good friend, calling often is very important factor.

    These two factors are qualities of a good friend that I think. Without feeling friend's mood and calling often, good relationship can not be expected. "	4	4	3.5	11.5
1323	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I have many friends. We can divide my friends into two groups. Group A is some friends that I like, and Group B is some firends that I hate. I could find some general things with Group A, and I think that are qualities of a good friend.     The first quality of a good friend is being helpful. All people have a goal, so I am now working hard to achieve it. But it is hard to achieve it by myself. So when I have friends, I can get some help and achieve our goal more fastly. Also, I can help my friend too. So finally, me and my friend can get a lot of benefits each other.     The second quality of a good friend is being communicative. Nowdays I am studying very hard to get a high score on the TOEIC test, so I am very tired and bored of studying. However, I have friends that I can talk. For example, when I have stress with studying, I call my friend and talk about League of Legends. In this way, I can erase my stress and study again. Also, being communicative can make us to make many friends. When we meet new person, we can't talk easily because it's very unfamiliar. But when we are communcative, we can get very close with new person easily.    The last quality of a good friend is being humorous. I had to go to the English Camp on January because I got a low score on the IBT TOEFL test. In the English Camp, there were lots of unfamiliar people. During the English Camp, we went to the restaurant with my group. At that time, I didn't know anyone of my group, but one humorous brother in my group made all people familiar while eating. Like this, if we have some humorous friend, we can have more fun.     For these reasons, I think that being helpful, being communicative, being humorous are the qualities of a good friend. I hope that I can get all three things while I'm in college, and I'm working hard on making good friends. "	4	4	3.5	11.5
1324	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Did you see any movie that tell you what is friend? I saw many, and especially one movie that shows real friendship of three friends made me surprised. After I saw that movie, I believe the qualities of a real good friend are 'honest', 'belief', and 'to believe each other'.

First quality is honest, but actually honest don't contain the meaning of 'do not lie'. Let's suppose that One man in hard situation tell ""Everything goes well!"" to his friend, then think about it. He would say that for some reasons such like ""I don't want him to know my situation, because he would worry it"". Honest that I want to tell you means 'to tell his friend for friend'. The relation between friends who truely think for each other is strong.

Secone quality is belief. To become real friend, he(or she) should have belief, because person who doesn't have belief easily change his(or her) own thinking. I call that kind of people 'one drop of water in the ocean.'. When wind blows, water goes and back with the direction of wind without its own thinking. This relation that 'A goes and B traces' will easily be broken.

Last one is 'to believe each other'. Everyone may think it when writing this essay. We all know the importance of it, so I would not say much about it. Just I want to tell you is 'this quality tells whether relation between people exist'. I strongly believe 'To believe' is the first step when people meet each other and get relationship.

I choose this three, because I think the qualities of good friend mean the 'long and deep relation'. If we have real good friends, we will meet them for long time. 'To believe' makes the first step to be good friend, 'Belief' makes them fun and think other way, and 'Honest' feel their friends good. T"	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
1325	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  We should meet a lot of people in school and society and make some friends. It is very important to make a good friend to make a lifetime happier. Let me talk about what are the qualities of a good friend today. I think there are three qualities of a good friend. Those are trust, humor, and sympathy.

  First of all, trust. Trust is a fundamental and key factor of all of interpersonal relationship. Once the trust is formed between people, they can break down the wall and approach each other. This is also in friendship. Trust must be a quality of a good friend.

  Second of all, humor should be a quality of a good friend. As we get older, we lose our laughter. If we have a humorous friend in this situation, we could relieve our stress. According to the research results, laughter increases the efficiency of work and makes daily life enjoyable.

  Lastly, sympathy. When life is hard, we want to be comforted. What if we had a friend who sympathize and make me comforted? A good friend can sympathize me and find a solution together. This is a quality of a good friend and also a good person.

  Today, I write an essay about ""what are the qualities of a good friend"". I think that trust, humor, and sympathy are the qualities of a good friend. I hope you have many friends with the above three characteristics."	4	4	3	11
1326	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"There are so many standards to make a good friend. I have two standards about my friends. I usually broke my relationships with someone who don't keep my rules.

First, a good friend should make the atmosphere not to be confused. This means a good friend doesn't make other friends embarrassed or annoying. Among many people, atmosphere can make the stream of the conversation is very important due to building relationship. We usually make up with others and see the surroundings not to destroy the atmosphere. However, some people could not read the atmosphere destroy the atmosphere and cut the stream of the conversation from others. It can be all right at once because everyone can make mistake if they are confused. But someone keep interfereing the relationship and breaking the atomsphere, I probably decides him/her not to make the relationship. Someone who reads the atmosphere well, however, he/she knows what they want. More precisely, he/she could read the situation and can make action to solve the atmosphere.

Second, a good friend should keep an eye on saying from others. This means they have to concentrate while other friends are saying. I strongly emphasizes the attitude in the conversation. This standards related to first standard.. First one is about situation, however, second one is about the person I talk to. For everyone, it is good to know someone's past to understand someone well. We have to watch about to talk about the past whether the past is good or not. In this situation, a good friend consider the past and talk to us not to be embarrassed. All I want to say is a good friend sees the person, not the conversation.

I made relationships with my friends for these two reasons. I think I'm still missing some important ideas about friendship. I will keep struggling to find my own definition of friendship."	3	3	2.5	8.5
1327	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     There are many qualities of a good friend. That is, that make relationship longer and deeper. Let's think about qualities of a good friend, especially friendly person.

     First, secret that two people only sharing can qualifies the relationship between two people. It's because only two people know that infomation, others can not participate in the relationship about that secret. Therefore, it makes relationship between first two people deeper.

     Second of all, this is related to the first one. This is belief between two people. belief each other makes two people exchange there secret. If someone tells you a secret story, it means the person believes you and ""please don't tell this story to anyone"". Therefore the person who listened a secret story from someone else, then the person should stay the story secret.

     Last of all, it is yield. Yield is neccessary for maintaining a relationship because there should be conflict between two people when they make any decision. Let's assume two people would eat lunch together. Then, they are going to make a decision what to eat for lunch. At this moment, yield is needed because each person want to eat some foods but different each other. If one person yield this time and then another person would yield nexttime. It means that two people should meet once more. From this situation, I realize that the yield make the relationship longer.

     I think these are the qualities of a good friend. Regarding this, I hope you can make many good friend who can keep secret, believe and yield each other."	3	4	2.5	9.5
1328	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I made so many friends in my 20 years life. I made friends in schools, academies, parks, swimming pool, and so on. Although it is good to make new friends, but sometimes I'm afraid about it because I don't know that he or she is good friends for me. I met so many good friends but i also met friends that gave me some bad influences. Then, what is the good friends? What are the qualities of a good friend? There are no correct answers, but today I'd like talk about that topic based on my experiences.

 The first quality is trust. The relationship between people is based on trust. If I don't trust my friend, then my friend also doesn't trust me, and our relationship never last. However, I trust my friends, I can rely on my friends. When I have in trouble, we can find the way to overcome it together. In addition, when I experience sad happens, I tell to my friends about my sad situation, and I can get some comfort from them. All this things are come from the trust between me and my friend.

 The second quality is communication. Although we trust each other, if we don't communicate well, we can't be good friends. Communication is essential for the relationship. Because I trust him, I can tell him about my story, and then I feel comfortable. Communication means regular meetings, too. It is important to meet regularly to maintain the relationship. Moreover, while we spend time together, we laugh more in that time and we can remove stress. 

 The third quality is understanding. Let's think that I meet my friend and I talk about my bad school life. But he doesn't understand my situation and just repeat saying, ""So, what's wrong with you?"". Then, I feel bad because he can't understand my situation and he don't know my mind. Understanding each other and trying to know other's mind is so important. Although understanding others is quite difficult, but we should try to understand others. 

 So far, I mentioned three qualities of a good friend, trust, communication and understanding. Although it is not a correct answer, but I'm sure these three things are so important to maintain good relationship between friends. I hope that I can make good friends in my life and I want to be some good friends to others. "	4	4	3.5	11.5
1329	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" From my experiences, I think there are three qualities of a good friend, friendship, caring, ability of listening.

 First, I think that friendship is the quality of a good friend. For being a good friend, friendship is important. It can make people care, understand. If you are a good friend, you must have friendship. It is the first step to be a good friend.

 Second, I want to say that caring is very important for being a good friend. In many situations, caring gives me good images. For example, if you want to sleep more, your good friend will be quiet for you. In this situation, your good friend cares you because of your sleep. The action of good friend makes you comfortable. In addition, It can make friend happy.

 Third, I think that ability of listening is the quality of a good friend. In many situations, ability of listening is better than ability of speaking. The people can speak anything to a good friend has a good ability of listening. For example, If you are a good listener, many friends will go to you because they want to speak everything. Plus, you will be a good friend for the process that your friends speak something to you.

 Because of these reasons, I think that friendship, caring, ability of listening are the qualities of a good friend."	3	3.5	3	9.5
1330	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I have a lot of good friend. they are from same middle school, high school or Kaist. So, I think I know about the qualities of a good friend. They are three point to be good friend.

First, good friend have to be kind. This include a lot of meaning. Good friend has to be considerate of other people or me. It impresses me. And other people tell me that he is so good friend. he can be recognized from other people. For example, I have a friend that treat other people so rudely. he stole other people's things like money or valuable thing. Other people lose a lot of thing. they hate him. I think that is so bad attitude. I think good friend will be loved every people. But, my rude friend can't be love any people. So, good friend will be kind. I think this is one quality of a good friend.

Second,  good friend like me. I think good friends like each other. This is so important point. If attitude toward each other is to be different, they are not friend. It can't talk about 'good friend'. They are not friend. For example, I thought one people is so good friend. He is so kind and his hobby was so similar with me. I was so enjoy playing with him. So, I thought he is so good friend. But he didn't think I'm so good friend of him. I was not his friend. He talked a lot of my gossip to others. When I know that, He cut our relationship. I knew he don't think that I was friend. So, I think good friend like each other.

Last, good friend must help each other develop. This is so good friendship. If one friend only assist other friend, this is not good relation. Good friend help each other and develop together. For example, when I was middle school student. I want to go science high school. But, I didn't study science well and my friend didn't study math well. So, we help each other. I teach math to him and he teach science to me. Finally, my friend and I can go science high school. I think this is a good sample of good friends. 

This three reason is so important that I think. So, this is the qualities of a good friend. If, you memory this three qualities when you think you have a good friend. This will be help to you. "	4	4	3	11
1331	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Friends are important to our life because we can share a lot of things that happen in the world and make connections, which make us feel that we are not alone. With friends, we get more energy when we do something hard. Therefore, I strongly believe that good friends should have some great qualities. Let me list some of them based on a few reasons.

First of all, good listening skill is one of the great qualities of a good friend. Although people who love to say their own story and who are not interested in listening to others will make us not boring, when we have some serious troubles with my life or feel tired, they might make us more tired. Instead, good listeners will try to understand what others are saying and what they are suffuring from. They are willing to share our pain. Even if they are not able to give some advises or something real, only listening would be very helpful to me, because I already believe that my friend takes care of me. 

Second, a good friend should let me know what I did wrong and try to correct it. If I can't figure out what I did wrong and don't fix it, I would become a people who don't care about serious problems nearby me. Friends often enjoy and feel comfortable with anything, but if they find me missing the right thing in moral, safe, or even studying, they need to teach me how to improve it. These interactions between friend never break the connection or make it worse, but make it more strongly.     

I tried to show you some qualities of good friend. e"	4	4	4	12
1332	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"have some good friends. And they have commend good points.

I think that a good friend have Three reasons.

First of all, A good friend trusts me. 

If I want to try something new, many friends avoid my trying.

But some friends are trust me and say ""Cheer up"" for me.

It makes me confidence and I can do my best.

Second, A good friend says their opinion.

My friend and me have good relationship, sometimes I have mistake.

Then a good friend have to say me about their opinion and my mistake.

We can have good relationship forever because of their opinion of my attitude.

Next, A good friend never make my opinion by force.

Adult can smoke. But I don't like smoking and it's smell

So if my friend wants to smoking with me, I will say ""Sorry, I don't like it's smell."" and avoid that situation.

But if my friend say again and again ""Smoke with me!"", I'll hate that friend and avoid that friend.

We talked about three good point of friend. 

Trust, saying their opinion, never make my opinion by force.

Then I try to be a good friend for my friends with this three reasons. "	3	2.5	2	7.5
1333	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In my case, I think good friends have three qualities.

First, we can contact anytime to good friends. If we don't think that we can't call somebody when we want, I think that kind of relationship is more like a buisness partner. But if somebody is a true friend, we don't hasatate to call him or her. Of course that that some situation has happened so our relationship is not so good now. But I think can call to that people if I think that person is a good friend.

For the second, good friends don't tell somebody's weakness to other people. When we are living this world, every people could have some week point. But some person tells that to other people and laugh with them. I think good friends don't do that and try to fix the weak point with him or her.

Finally, good friends are my side if I have some trouble. We could make mistake sometime, and some people could notice it. If that people don't have much relationship with me, they could just walk away. And that time, if that people are good friends, they tell me that I had some problem at some moment and why don't you try to fix it."	2.5	3.5	2.5	8.5
1334	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I think that good friend has a good personality. It is my important sight of view for identifying someone. So What is a good personality? There are many type of personality in the world. And everyone has differnt personality than others. So I am looking someone about three points of view. It is not mean scoreing someone. It is just point of view.

First point is how they act when I have a diseaster. I think it is really important point. Sometimes, some people emit their purpose to meet other person. I really hate people whose purpose of realation is their benefit. If I can't give them a benefit, they leave you alone. So I show the weak point for check them. It is a very fast way to except the bad friend.

Second point is how they act when I feel happy. I think it is harder than first point. It is a not necessery point. But it is a point of view that make me find a really good friend. I think crying with sad person is easier than laughing with happy person. Control the negative emotion when I see the friend's success. I think that it is a best way to find the good friend.

Last point is how much feel comfortable when I meet them. When I meet the friend who make me laugh. I am excited and feel so good. When I'm tired, I meet them. I feel more tired. But comfortable firend always make me better. All situation they can help me. When I feel sad, I can heal just they be my side. When I feel happy, I can improve the emotion when they be my side. So I want a friedn who can borrow their sholdier and I can borrow it.

As a result, It is a three point when I check someone. But it is not absolutly point to check someone. Sometimes I find a good friend but they don't fit this point. Last of all, I think that doing a effort to be a good friend is more important than how to check someone. So I always do the effort to be a good friend."	3	3.5	2.5	9
1335	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In my opinion 'nice listener' is the most important quality of good friend. There are several reasons that i think nice listener can be a nice friend. 

First, when someone has difficulty on somtehing there should be friend who can take care of him. By listening his difficulty, friend can understand his situation and give some help to him, or just listening what situation he is in can help him overcome his difficulties. 

Second, if there are some problems between friends, they have to listen their friends opinions and appreciate each others opinion. If no one listen listen the others opinion, there will be no solution of their controversy. Good listeners can understand friends opinion and tell his opinion properly.

Third, nice listeners can respect their freinds more. nice listeners will have more information about his friends such as what icecream taste he likes or what habit he has. Then friend will get sense of being respected by trial favors. In my case, I have nice listener friend he know a lot about me he knows my favorite food, my hobby and thing that i don't like. I feel that he give me a respect.

Also, people who are good at keeping time can be a nice friend. When we make an appointment with friends, it's very important to be in time. When someone always lates, the others have to wait. It makes friends irritated. Friends will not trust him antmore. In contrast, when someone always be in time. He will give his friends a sense of trust.

For these reasons i think listening attitude and keeping time are properties to be a good friend"	3	3.5	3	9.5
1336	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" While living, Having good friends is one of the most important parts. It can make us become a better person. If we don't care about the qualities of a good friend, however, even we cannot be a good friend to others. So now, I will introduce several traits that helps you not only 'make' a nice friend but also 'be' a nice friend.

 First of all, a good friend is same as a good adviser. You don't need to agree with all of things that friends do. Not criticizing, but advising personally as a friend is very helpful to be a good friend. For example, in my case, my best friend gave some advices about my way to study when I was in high school. More specifically, one of his advices is that memorization is not always true in biology class. From those advices, I learned the better way from him and exactly had a bigger effect on my academic improvement.

 Not only that, but friends and you should have something in common. Doing the common things is the easiest and best way to develop friendship. 

 In brief, I believed that the two qualities of a good friend is personal adviser and things in common. Think about whether you and your friends are doing those two or not. If not, make sure to do the same!"	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
1337	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I think there are three qualities to decide what is a good friends

  First, one of the qualities of good friend is trying to hear and understand my opinion. Once they hear my voice, they can recognize my feeling and interact well with me. Good hearing makes friendship last longer. When I see the book ""MOMO"", I realized that momo's just good hearing makes other people relived and happy. Like this, good hearing is the best way to show that I am trying to understand your speaking and understand your feeling.

  Second, there must be some similar hobby or viewpoint in good friendship. With same or similar hobby or viewpoint, they can exercise, play game, or just talking with the topic they are interested in. Also, the most important thing is with sharing activities, they can have feelings (like fun, happy, love, upset, touched) with friends. Sharing these feelings is important in friendship, so they should have similar hobby or viewpoint to share their feelings. These feelings and memories can be a big bond among the friends 

  Third, they should respect each other. In my experience, even if all qualities above this paragraph are equipped in friendship, if there are not respect each other, They will hate each other and hardly do interact. I think I love my people who like me, and I hate people who hate me. Show your respect to friends, then they will respect you. Friendship with disrespect is like a sinking boat.  Good respect makes good friendship. By showing your respect, you make friend's confidence higher and their chatting's qualities better. 

  These three qualities should be the qualities of a good friends.  "	4.5	3.5	3.5	11.5
1338	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In the whole life, people meet lots of people and they make some friends. In my opinion, to make a good friend is important. Similary, it is important that me become a good friend. Then what are the qualities of a good friend? 

First, to be a good friend, we have to lose sometimes. The person who wants to win all time for some discussion in the relationship with friends, other people feel uncomfortable. 

Secondly, good friend must know that friend's emotion. Additionally, good friend should talk about his emotion. Good friends are sharing their emotions and encourage each other. In my case, I feel 

Finally, good friend need catch friends when they are doing the bad one. When I was middle school student, I can see a lot of that cases. One person is going to do bad thing, and her friend wasn't catch her. Later, one person who did bad thing is do that repeatly, and her friend was just following. More later, I can see her friend feels 

In my opinion, the qualities of a good friend is that I wrote above. I think we'd better to become a good friend to others with that three qualities."	2.5	2.5	3	8
1339	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" We can meet very many people and we can make many freinds during our life. Some friends are good for us, but maybe some friends are not just good. We need to be a good friend to others, and we need to find who is the real good friends for us. There is many qualities of a good firend. Same hobby, country, school and the other things. But I think the important qualities are don't make friends tired, make bright energy, and really think about the friends.

 FIrst, good friend should not make me tired. I think bad friend always make me tired. They give me stress in many different ways. When I was together with them, I should think about them, not me. Good friend make me feel good, comfortable, and take a rest. I can only focus on me and only think about my works. This will make the good effect for my study, jobs and the other works. Sometimes I can firght with good friends too, but almost, they make me happy. Every people need their own time. People should focus on themselves for their lives. Firend is imfortant part of lives, too. So if you want to be a good friend, you should not make the others tired. 

 The second quality is bright energy. When we look around, there is some people make bright energy to others. This kind of people can give us energy during the day. Same as the reason of first qulity that I wrote above, people need to be happy and feel good. When we meet the hard things, they give us power and energy to break the difficult and doing a better jobs. We need to talk to friend when we crash at the wall. 

 Lastly, the most important quility, we should really think about the friends. We can get the other's helps are true or fake. When I was very tired and sad, my friend give me a power, and I felt the friend like me and he really think about me. I was very happy because of him. After that, I want to be a good friend to him and I care him when we felt tired. If the hobby is differnt, country is different and the other things are differnt, it's okay. But I think this quality is terribly important. 

 The same thing of this three qualities are about giving good energy and do not making firend tired. I think we have this three qualities, we can be a good friend already. Maybe the friends are big part of our lives. We can make good firends when we are a good friend to them. Don't make firends tired, make bright energy for friends, and care about them by true mind. "	3	3	2.5	8.5
1340	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I think we should be a good person before being a good friend. I haven't ever seen any 'good friends' who think they are good person. 

There are several qualities to judge whether someone is a good person or not.

The first one is self-satisfaction. Someone who has low self-satisfaction, the energy which flows from him or her will be negative. I know it because I am the low self-satisfied person. Negative atmosphere from him or her will make the atmosphere of conversation down. We all already know that 'Negative' is obviously avoided than 'Positive', so these people have less probability to be a good person than others.

Second, good people usually listen to others more than talk. When we make a conversation, there should be two types of person, one is talker and the others are listener. The number of listeners will be the same or more than the number of talker. So we prefer listeners to talkers. And also when we listen more, we can understand others more than when we just talk to others. It is important to make relationship better.

Last, good people are easy-laugher. They have more laughs than others. Smiling and laughing have the most positive energy among the human's faces, so they make us happier and delightened.

These are conditions to be a good person. But if they are good people, there are more conditions to be a good friend. Some 범죄자 may be good people to others, but they change their forms absolutely opposite to the victims. Likely, if someone is heard a good person, he or she could not familiar to you. These are qualities of a good friend I think: keeping secrets, no gossippings.

Keeping secrets is very important quality to be a good friend. If someone tell me secrets of the others, they definitely tell my secrets to others. I cannot believe these people. The most important thing between friendship is whether they believe each other, and uncovering others' secrets is the worst thing to keep belief.

Not doing gossippings is also pretty important. As the same reason that I hate uncovering secrets, doing gossippings are not so good for keeping belief of yours. 

In summary, conditions to be a good people are high self-satisfaction, good listener, easy-laugher and to be a good friend is 'let you believe'. 

Thank you."	3	3.5	4	10.5
1341	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" First, a good friend can empathize to my feelings. If I have a good event, the good friend can celebrate this and share happy feeling with me. Also, If I have a sad event, the good friend can not only understand my feeling, but also know how he/she makes me feel better. When I was a highschool student, there are many friends around us, but the best friends were people who have this quality. As I remenber, when I have the good news about the unniversity entrance, they grabed my hands and jumped with excited voice. I can't forget that moment and will never forget that forever. Also, whenever I feel tired or frustrated, they hugged me and suggested to go out and eat delicious food. Rather than having jealous feeling to me or giving the advise that doesn't have truth, the behaviors that my friends who were next to me when I was a highschool student made me happy.

 Second, a good friend can protect my private. I like friends who don't have lots of curious about my private. Event though I tell somethings careful about my private, the good friend should not tell this to other people that I don't know well or not very familiar with me. If friend cares so much on my life, there always have friction or end with bad feelings. If I and my friends live each life hardly and often go to cafe or restaurant to share each others life story, it is enough and the most ideal relationship.

 There are many other qualities except the things I told above. But I think the most impotant things that a good friend should have are those two things. "	3	4	4	11
1342	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  The qualities of a good friend is respect, honest, and kindness. I have three reasons, and I am going to explain about them.

  At first, respect is helpful for friends' connection. If friends have angry filling each other, the respect can solve angry at that moment. I think respecting mind can make many positive effect, because we want to show our good face to respected person. This effect cause honest and kindness, so respect is good for friends' connection each other.

  Second, honest is necessary for relationship. We know that the honest person is good, and honest make trust strongly. Washington's story is very famous all of the world, so our parents said don't lie and always honest like Washington.

  Third, kindness is my very big advantage. Why I mention that, because lots of my friends said to me you are a good friend. In my experience, we had some time which wrote friend's advantage on the paper. I checked my paper, many friends wrote ""you are very kindness to all friends it is helpful when I didn't make friends yet. I appreciate to you."" We need to be kind many people when we are able to cover, because the small kindness cause big good effect to other people. I could make sure a lot of people said that you are a good person to me, so we can connect a good friend and kindness which is my advantage.

 Therefore the respect honest, and kindness is not only necessary to be a good friend, but also to be respected person or friend. I want to say the three words is important to our life, and it will make good effect each other. "	3	3.5	2.5	9
1343	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In my opinion, the first quality as a good friend Is smiling a lot. When we meet a person it makes us feel comfortable and good when we see a person smiling. when I was in high school there was a friend who always laughed and smiled at me. when my feeling was not good I would go and meet that friend and he would make me feel happy again, just by smiling at me. When that friend smiled at me. I felt that I could trust him and I wanted to talk with him a lot.

The second quality as a good friend is being with me when I am very sad or I'm in a very bad mood.

There are some people who turns away from their friends when their friend is having a very hard life. But I think a really good friend needs to be together when his friend is sad. when I was very tired by preparing my university at high school. There was a friend who was always beside me. he said that "" don't use all of your energy in preparing your interview, have some rest, watch some movies, and play games."" this words was what I wanted to hear when I was preparing my interview and It changed my life pattern. I decided one day which I can play freely. And at that day I didn't study anything. And had a rest. I slept for hours of watched some movies or drama with my friend. My life quality changed a lot because of that friend. If that friend was not beside me when I was preparing for the university I wouldn't be here in KAIST. 

The last quality as a good friend is not talking about my bad things when I am not with him. 

What I don't like the most is when I find my friend talking bad things to other people about me. It feels like I was betrayed by my friend. This is not my story but when I was at high school. This kind of thing happens a lot. When I was talking to someone he started to say bad things about his friend and people around him started to laugh. When I thought that I could be the topic in their conversation. It made me feel bad. 

There are a lot of qualities to be a good friend. But a person can't be a perfect person. even I don't know if I am a good friend to others. But I think smiling a lot, being together with a friend when he is tired, and not betraying is the basics to be a good friend     "	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
1344	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In the world, there are several types of people. But, we cannot be friends with all types of people. In my opinion, there are three things to be a good friend.First of all, I need to be comfortable when my friend is with me. 

In addition, I can share my feelings, such as happiness or sadness, with my friend.

Finally, my firend sometimes can give me solutions of my thoughts.

To sum up, there are three qualities of a good friend. Need to be comfortable, can share my feelings, and give some solutions to me. I think to be a best friend, their personalities need to be matched well. "	1.5	2	2.5	6
1345	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In your life, good Friends make you happy and make you encourage everytime. They will be some power of your life being beautilful. So good friend is so important to everyone. Today, I'll talk about qualities of a good friend. I think there are 3 qualities. belief for each, similar hoby and shared memory.

First, belief is the most important quality of a good friend. When i met friend, i said my deepest story of me such a seceret. Then i alway got really good advise. I think that is one of most important function of friend. Unless i belive them, It couldn't happen.

Second, simlilar hoby is important. To spend the great time with your friends, we must have what can enjoy together and it might be simlilar hoby. For example, if your friend and you like soccer, your friend and you can enjoy playing soccer, talking about soccer player and watching soccer cup together. That time will make you and your friend great relationship.

Last, shared memory is important. In my experience, when i met my friends, we always talk about memories we were together. Memories will be a strong rope between your freindship. If you don't belive one friend is good friend to you, you can remind good memories with him then you can continue your relationship with your friend. 

If you want to make good freind, please remember the three qualities. belief, simlilar hoby and shared memory. than, you could get a best friend."	3.5	4	3	10.5
1346	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  ""Friend, I will never forget you."" This is the lyrics of one of my favorite song. Like this, I have many friends that I will never forget. I wondered about the reason that how I made this friends. So I started to think since the elementary.

  When I was about 9 years old, I had many friends in my hometown. We went to the same elementary school, went to the same academy, and played after the academy finishes. We did this almost everyday, so it is not hard to meet them. For 6 years in the elementary school, I thought I made a lot of friendship with my friends. When I was 6 grade student in elementary, I took the test to enter the 'Hwasan middle school.' It was a famous school for studying, but it is not located in my hometown. Fortunately, I passed the test, and entered Hwasan middle school.

  Before I enter the middle school, I was very worried. Because I didn't know anybody in the middle school. Also, it was a dormitory school. So at the first time, it was hard to live for me who is very young. However, because of the dormitory, I could make friends fast. We lived together, studied together, and did exercise together. As the time goes by, my elementary friends are forgotten and my middle school friends became more friendly to me. I thought about this carefully. When I was an elementary student, I had many friends but we fought several times too. Because of this, I didn't trust them a lot. We were friends, but we were not the real friends. We just met to play together, but we didn't think for each other. However, my middle school friends were different. I could feel their mind. They were very honest to me, when I was sick, they took care of me. We can be a victim for each other. At that time, I realized that the friendship depends on the 'Trust'.

  When I was 17, I entered Jeonbuk Science High School which is JBSH. I met many new friends in the JBSH too. Also it was a dormitory school too, so it was easier to make friends early. Since I graduate the elementary school, I didn't send a message to my elementary friends. Because they are forgotten to me. But in the high school, I kept contacting with my middle school friends. They all lived in the different city, but we met to go travel to Busan. It was very surprised that we know about each other more than we thought. We all know about our personalities and the most important thing is we trust together.

  Now I entered KAIST, and became the first grade student in the universe. Many years are passed since I graduate the middle school, but I stiil contact with them. Also I have many nice friends in the high school too. Likewise, the qualities of a good friend is trust. Trust should be the background to make a real friend. I am trying to give the trust to new friends who met in KAIST. Now I am still young, and I have a lot of time to meet many kinds of people. I am looking forward to make new friends that trust each other. "	2	4.5	3.5	10
1347	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Human beings are pretty weak and vulnerable when their groups get torn apart and each person becomes alone. So they have chosen the life way, which suggests to live together and make society. It has been very efficiency way to hide their weakness from ancient age to modern society. If someone asks you what is friend and what is the best part of getting friend, you'd better to focus on yourself and your friends because friend is mirror which reflects you.

 I have 3 standards to distinguish whether he/she is good friend for me.

 First, The basic viture will be required. For example, deceiving must not exist between two of people, which are friend each other. Even if he/she did a lie for a good purpose, it harms a lot in the relationship between friend. When i was in science highschool, the students should enter in dormitory. They are inclined not to make conflict because they have to meet each other for the every hours of day. If they make a noise between their friend relationship, it becomes very uncomfortable each time they see their friends. When there is conflict between people, modern people are more supposed to cut their relationship, not suggesting a sequence of fixing their broken relationship. That's why i have my first standards of good friends.

 Second, The true friends ususally congratulate the good events of his/her friend. For example, There are 2 people and they are friends. suppose both of them prepared some job-test but one person only pass the test. When the failed-friend becomes upset because only his friend passed the exam and doesn't congratulate his triumph in his/her sincere heart, it is not 'real friend'

 third, when someone is true friend of other man/woman, he/she would sacrifice himself/herself sometimes. It is not a region of fairness, but the true hearts to think about his/her friends. 

It is very hard to find 'The True friend in my standard' which is satisfying all of those qualities. I also didn't find friends which satisfy all of my standards. I always appreciate to my luck each time i make a friend who is satisfying even one of those standards, because real world is not the ideal world and even more distorted. "	2.5	3	2.5	8
1348	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If someone ask me ""What are the qualities of a good friend?"" I will give a four answers.

First, You must able to say uncomfortable but right things to your friends. In Korea, some people says ""Friend is your mirror."" which means your friends' manners or actions are depending on you and viceversa. So you have to act good and make your friends good is important to both. So it is quite important to be able to say uncomfortable but right things. Lots of group of teens are tend to do bad things(drink, smoke, even steal) because it's easy to do bad things with friends when good things are not. There's a old phrase in Korea ""良藥苦口"" which means ""Good pills are bitter in your mouth"". I think this is reason of it. Advice of angel is bitter but Advice of evil is sweet. So to become a good friend and to become a good group, you must able to say uncomfotable but right.

Second, You should think his situation. World is not fair, and people are not equal(even twins!). There's a lot of differences between you and your friends, like height could be different, face, interest, grade, welth, health, and etc could different. So You have to pay attention to your friend and have to think in his(or her) position, because situations between You and Your friends are different. If you don't care his situation and think only in yous, you can't be his(or her) friends. So to become a good friend you have to think in his(or her) situation.

Third, you don't have to be selfish. Friendships are building on ground called ""shareing"". So it is important to fill fairness between friends. If you become a rude man or act selfish to your friend, He or She would fill this is not fair friendship. And once your friend felt it you and your friend can be a good company again. So you must not to be selfish, and you should be able to share yours to your friends.

Finally you have to pay attention to your friends. Text to him, call to him, You have to pay an effort for your friends to have a good friendship. You have to focus on his(or her) situation and have to express your love to your friends. Friendship is built with you and your friends effort, So you must think of your friends and act for your friends.

I hope that this is good answer for the question."	4	4	4	12
1349	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" In my thought, the condition of being 'good' friend is so various and subjective. Even though i cannot assure that my opinion about the good friend is an obvious answer, I'll give you some thoughts that i have about the good friend. I consider respect as the most important thing of the relationship of the friends. Therefore, I think the friends who understand other friends and respect their thoughts are good friends. For more details, The following three things are qualities of a good friend in aspects of the respect.

 The first one is 'open-minded'. Respect starts from admitting other people's culture and thought. To affirm other things which is different from things someone owns, He or she ought to make their mind opened. This applies to the relation of friends, too. It is impossible to have same mind, same thoughts Whenever someone makes or meets his or her friends. So, It is essential to have mind opened for being good friend. 

 Next one is 'not-selfish'. Selfish people cannot adjust any other group of people, even friends.

 Final one is 'generous'. It is important to treat other people, friends as me. If someone has different tools for estimating, No one likes them.

 My conclusion of the qualities of a good friend is the three things, 'open-minded',  'not-selfish', and 'generous'."	3	3.5	2.5	9
1350	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"This time, I explain my opinion of the qualities of a good friend. 

First, good friend should have respect and understanding between people. If they don't have respect and understanding, they can't understand their action. Then, they will fight and get worse. Eventually, their friendship is broken. Also, I think if people were more friendly with friend, people need respect and understanding. 

Second, good friend don't have to hit people. Although they can't find proper opinion each other, they never hit each other. This situation get worse, then they erase each other. I think people should talk about hating point that they want to change. It helps finding harmony point about opinion. Through this talking, they can be more friendly.

I think there are more things about qualities of friend such as appointment, fun, same habit, face and voice. But I think this two things are very important. If we have this two things, we could be good friend to people and make good relationship each other."	3	3	3	9
1351	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Before talk about good friend. How could we make definition of the friend. In the case of korea 'friend' means same age person too, but this is maybe not the kind of definition of friend what we want. So, what is the friend? Are there some conditions should be satisfied to be a friend of somebody? In my opinion, there is no condition. Everybody, even everything would be a freind for someone. for example, age is not matter about being friends. As we can see in dailylife old men and women are the best friend of thier grandchildren. How about spieces, there is no problem too. So many people live with their pet as friends. How about life? It is not often but there are the people think game characters or comic book characters are their friend. It is extremely rare but we can think the situation like 'Cast away'. So the mediate conclusion is 'There is no condition to being friends'

 And now we should talk about the real topic, what are the qualities of a good friend? To make it easy, i will think friends as a social tools for mankind. Because, we can not live well with no friend, so all of us make some kind of friend for each way by our demand. Let's think about what is the GOOD tool. The word 'good' for tools means it makes good outputs for their objective: existing reason. And we can make a question, 'What is the purpose of friends?' 'Why we could make friens within our lives?' In my opinion, the main function of friends is sharing. Every people wants to hide and share themself in the same time. There are so many people we should hide from, like unknowns, somebody has bad relationship with us or just somebody we just know. and we need friends as the anti-thesis of them. So, "	1	2.5	3	6.5
1352	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  I think there are many good friends around me. Someone gave me a passion and heartwarming. However, the qualities of a good friend are ambiguous. Therefore, Now I want to express the qualities of a good friend which I think.

  First of all, I think the good friend has their own justice. The justice means that someone get fury and can't withstand situation that there are unpair things. For example, when someone lives hard life at school as he can't express his opinion and small body, my friend MinHo can't ignore the situation and say loudly ""It is unfair!"". He guard him, and find his merit to make friend with him. Although someone say that justice don't mean your thought, I think the example illustrates the justice to be a good friends well. For this reason I think justice is one of the qualities of a good friend. 

  Next quality is what can hear other person's opinion. There are Some people around me who don't hear other person's opinion and argue strongly their wants. When I see them, I think I really don't want to be a friend with them. However, my friend Minhyeok always says his opinion after hears other person's opinion. And He can make nice direction which include all opinion. After I talk with him, I hope that he always stays around me. Therefore, in my opinion, the ability which can hear other person's opinion is also one of the qualities of a good friend. 

  The third quality is mind for challenge. It means that someone hates routine and always wants challenging for anythings. The friend who has this quality often inspire me to challenge. For example, my friend Jong hyeon always spends many hours doing his own hobby. Few month ago, He effort to get license of photoshop. He study hard and modify the photos everyday. And now he is interested in roller board. The place to ride the board is so far from his home. However, it doesn't matter for him and he goes the place almost everyday. As I see him, I also inspire to do something like growing plants, and climb all mountain in my hometown. For this reason, this ability is also a qualitie of a good friend. 

  Although there are more qualities like 'don't waste money', I think that the best qualities are the three one. As I think about good friend, I got a question, ""Am I a good friend to my friend?"". However, the answer is ""NO"". I just find good friends before I becom a good friend. Therefore, I will change my style to treat other person and become a good person with my friends. "	3	3.5	2.5	9
1353	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In My opinion, There is something that decide the qualities of a good friend.

First of all, respect for friends.

Surely, respect is important for every case in life. But I think respect is especially important for good friend. because the more close you are to friends, the more rude you can be to each other.

So, If you want to be a good friend, you should respect your friends first. 

Second, the quality of a good friend is his value.

from his value, we can know what he think about friend and what person he is. for example, a friend have value ""I never lie to my friends"" and ""respect for other is most important in life"" I think, the friend is a good friend.

the qualities of a good friend are difficult to be decided. But I think the friends that respect others and have a good value are a good friend."	2	2	3	7
1354	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I think the qualities of a good friend are friend who I feel convenient and who I can trust and share our thinking, who I want to do something together. First, a good friend is the friend who I feel convenient. If I stay in same place with a not good friend, I will feel nerverous and think to avoid this place. And unconvenient friends are not actually friends. They are just people who my friend know or meet me brief time or I feel afraid. These kind of friends is not real friends. Second, the friend who I can trust and share our thinking is very friendly to me. If the friend cheats me, I can't trust him and share many things like thinking, mind, secret. But the good friend, I can do that. Finally to do something with unconvenient person is suffered me. When I was highschool student, I must be team with person who I hate. "	2	2.5	2.5	7
1355	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Friend is the most important thing in your life. Everyone cannot live without other people. Many people meet other poeple, and they give help to each other. Friends are very helpful. However, sometimes friend might not be a good presence for some reasons such as difference of thinking or personalitiy... etc. So people makes their own best friend by their decision. Now I will tell you what are the qualities of a good friend with my experience.

 

 First, a good friend hears carefully what I am saying. Friend who always says that he or she want to say and does not hear my opinion, makes me tired. With good friend who hears and understand my opinion well, I can do somethings more harmonically with that friend. For example, with this good friend, when I and my friend go trip, we can choose places, time, plans more easily. This friend usually does not makes me stressful. 

 Second, a person who share my emotion well is good friend. When I am happy, a good friend smile with me, also when I am sad, the good friend encourages me. This quality gives me power to do anything when I am tired, and also by sharing good things, this can be happy experience. When I was long face while preparing exam, good friend encourages me and give me power to study.

 Finally, a good friends keep promise well. For example, when I plan to meet with my friend at certain time, a bad friend late many times. One or two times are okay, but many times makes me very very tired.

 These are several things that good friends have. A person who has these all good things are my best friends. I think having good 5 friends are better than 100 any friends. I recommend to find good friends around you and make as your best friend!"	4	4	3	11
1356	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  In world, people want to make a good friend. Nobody want to make a bad friend. I want to make a good friend too. Why people want to make a good friend? Because, good friend give us many positive things. They listen carefuly our voice and do action for us. saying different, a person who listen carefuly our voice and action for us is a good friend. In next paragraph, let's see the details of a good friend.

  First, I think listening and remember are qualities of a good friend. Listening is a very important thing in relationship. When people talk each other, someone does not listening, other people can feel he does not concentrate on talking. so I think listening is the quality of a good friend. 

Second,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Finally,

  We talk about the qualities of a good friend. Listening and remember is the first reason that I say. In this reasons, I think good listening and remember is the qualities of a good friend."	1.5	2	2.5	6
1357	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In my opinion, there are four qualities of a good friend.

First, a good friend is very good at listening. He(or she) focus on me with eye contact when I speak. That action makes me happy. So I feel I can speak everything when the friend is listening.

Second, a good friend can tell me ""you are wrong."". Some fake friends always sweet talk in front of me. But they said different things back of me. After that situation, I think 'Sweet liers are not good friends. If someone tell me about my mistake or my fault, he is the real good friend.""

Third, a good friend can resonance with me. It means when I sad, he can cry together with me. When I happy, he can laugh together with me. He can share his emote for me. I think it is very important point in relationship of people, not only friends.

Lastly, a good friend place nearly. It is not a physical distance, distance of spirit. I'm not hesitate sending a message or Kakao talk to good friends. They make me sending a message is very comfortable things.

For these reasons, I think a good friends have same qualities. "	3	3	2.5	8.5
1358	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"There are so many people in the world. And we meet lots of people in our lives and make lots of friends. We hope all our friends should be good friends. But, unfortunately, it may be too hard for many people. I think this reason is many people don't know about the qualities of a good freind. And, I think good friends must have two qualities.

First, they should have open mind. It means, they can understand lots of people, such as their habbits, hobbies, eating habbits, etc. There are so many people. And they are all different. If someone doesn't have open mind, he may not be a good friend all of them. In may case, when I was high school students, I have specail friend. She and I are so different. Before she meet, I and my friends have simmilar hobbies, habbits, our mind, etc. We share so many things, understood each others, and empathize with us. So I thought it's right, and everyone should be like me. But, she didn't. So, we often fought first. Her mind was so different. And at first, we didn't understand each other. But later, we learned all people are different and we could be a good friend. And she is my best friend now.

Second, they should strict to me. It means, when I did bat things or something wrong, they must stop me. Some people got bad feeling at that tiem, but later, they may feel thank for me. In my case, I was weak for someone I loved. And I satisfied for her everyday, every time. My friends thought it's very bad to me because I always felt sad and so tired. So they said stop always to me. But, at that time, I couldn't understand, but now, I always thank for them.

So, I think these two qualities should they "	3	3.5	3	9.5
1359	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" In our life, we make a lot of friends in many different places. Sometimes they can be in your school, be your neighbor, etc. However, you won't think that all of your friends are not good friend. Today, I will tell you about my opinion about the qualities of a good friend.

 First of all, I think understanding friend's condition or their feeling will be the most important quality of a good friend. That's because if we don't understand our friend's condition of their feeling, it could ruin our relationship easily. For example, assume that your friend is in very exhausted condition because of huge amount of assignment. And you call him to drink some alcohol in the late night. In this condition, your friend will be very tired, so he can think that your suggestion is so annoyed because he wants to sleep as earlier as possible. If you can't notice your friend's condition and suggest him drinking alcohol repeatedly, your friend can be angry. As you can see in this example, understanding friend's condition or their feeling will be important.

 Next, listening will be important quality of a good friend. Communication have to be occured between you and your friend. In communication, I think listening is the most important one. Because, if we talk about one topic, we can have same, or different opinion with our friend. In this case, sometimes we have to make only one opinion. If we do not listen friend's opinion and only say about our opinion, it is very rude attitude for your friend. Moreover, they think you are not such a good friend, becuase they can feel your attitude is rude and only talk about your opinion sometimes can make trouble in friendship.

 Lastly, same point make us as a good friend to our friend. We usually talk, play, and do something with our friend. In this case, if we have same hobby, or same think about our friend can make our friend feeling us as a good friend. For me, I think I have 4 best friends. We graduated same high school, and we have same hobby, playing games and talking with each other. This means me and my friends usually play computer games together, and talk our daily life. Not only for me, but also for my friends, we feel comfortable and happy when we meet each other.

 Today, I told you about three qualities of good friend. Understanding your friend's condition or feeling, listening, and same point with friend. How about your opinion about the qualities of good friend? Let me know about your opinion!"	4	4.5	3.5	12
1360	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" When we live, we need many people for us. Friends are very important for many reasons like we can talk each other, play with friends, or do other things. So it is important to have a good friends. I think there are some qualities of good friends. Now, I will write about some qualities that good friends should need.

 First of all, friend and me should understand each other about difference. Everyone is different in some ways like opinion or other things, so there can be trouble between friends and me. But if me and my friend understand each other, there would be no problem. And we can develop our weakness from talking about each other. Then, we would be a good person. So I think it is important to undestand each other.

 Second, there should be some similar hobby between us. If we have same hobby, we can enjoy that hobby together and we can be more close. Also we can talk about that hobby more deeply so we can have more fun about it. For example, if me and my friend play same computer game, it will be more fun when play that game together. So I think it is good to have simmilar hobby with friends.

 Last qualities that I think of a good friend is kindness. If someone is not kind, other people may not want to have close relationship with him. And if we become a friend who is not kind, we can be like him because we spend a lot of time with friend. If we become a friend who are very kind, we can be more kind like him. So I think kindness is important qualitiy of good friend. 

  In this paragraph, I wrote about three qualities of a good frineds. Of course there are more other qualities that good friend should need, but I think these qualities are the most important thing to be good friends."	3.5	3.5	3	10
1361	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" People are needing friends. A famous society said that humanity is so society animal so we can't live alone. All of people want to make great friends. I'm also belonging here. Then, What is the qualities of a good friend. Now, let me introduce my opinion about this topic. 

 I think that there're three things to be a good frind. First, kindness is important quality of a good friend. Let's think about one situation. One day, you're in school at rainy day. However, you don't bring an umbrella. This is so sad and common situation, isn't it? You tries to go home so tell your situation to your friend. If your freind is not kind enough to use his(her) umbrella with you, he ignore you and just go alone. But if your friend is kind enough, you can go home without wet. This is trivial but common example about kind friend. However, if your friend isn't kind enough to use his umbrella, you can't go home without wet. Furthermore, you may have a cold and can't go school the next day. That situation is trivial thing but it may go bad. Thus, kindness is important and why kindness can be a quality of a good friend.

 Second, fun friend is important to play anything. All people may have an experience to play with their friends. If there aren't fun friend, the mood among the friends and you may go to cold. Then, you think that if there're fun friend, we can play more and more fun. and if you have some bad thing, the fun friend can make you happy. Ofcourse, It can't be a good friend who is fun but do not think your mind and behave just he(her) want. This is not healthy relationship and in the future, you and your fun friend's relationship may go bad in high percentage. 

  Finally, sensitive friend is nessesary through your life. If you have bad thing like fighting with you parents, this friend can be a good counseller. With them you can be more mature and can learn their considerable things through their behavior. This is good friend also. 

 These are three qualities of a good friend that I think. Every people want to make good and best friend. However, most of them don't see back theirselves. I want to say some sentence and end of this writing. To make good friends which I said, you should be a good friend first. Thank you for reading my opinion and I'll end this writing here.     "	3.5	4	2.5	10
1362	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"When we look around us, we can find two groups of people. In my case, I usually sort out them according to my own way. Someone who are kind for me or someone who are not familiar with me.

In this case, I think someone who are kind for me is good friends. Then, have you ever thought about what are the qualities of good friends? If you have not, why don't you read my opinion and compare it with your own idea.

In my opinion, the frist quality to be a good friend is focusing on opinions of other people. By listening well and concentrating their own idea, you can understand what they want to talk about. Moreover maybe, you can solve their problems by just listening well. Do you know a book named ""momo""? In this book, the boy who is named 'momo' always listen to worries and problems of other people. Momo doesn't do anything but only listening. In this process people who talked with momo could find solution to their own problems, and I think it realizes us that listening well and focusing on other people's opinions is good way to be a good friend.

Second quality to be a good frined is to be honest to your friends. Always be honest and never tell lies to other people. By being honest to your friends, you can make a strong relationship with your friends, and they'll always trust you. In ancient period, there were two best friends. They were always honest to each of them. One day one of them made their king angry, so he had to be dead by the king. He said he wants to meet his family and king didn't allow it. At that time, his friend said that he is going to be daed if his friend is late. So the king allowed it and when the time of judgement his friend came back after met his family. King was touched by their freindship so both of them could save their lives. You can see why to be honest is important quality to become a good friend in this stroy.

Last quality of a good friend is that always help your friends when your friends suffer from hard situation. By helping them, you could make strong realtionship with your frined, and someday they'll try to help you when you're in trouble. When there were roman empire, one man just walked in forest and met lions. He was afraid of lion at first, but after a few moments, he knew that lion was suffered from torn in its foot. The man felt poor about that lion, and removed it from its foot. They became good friends by this situation. After that the man was captured by army and had to fight against lion. Fortunately the lion was his friend lion and lion helped him to excape from the colloseum. This story shows us importance of helping other friends.

These three factors are the most important qualities to be a good friend in my opinion. Do you have good friends? If you have think about it. Are you a good friend for them? Always remember these factors and try to keep it to become a good friend for your good friends.   "	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
1363	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I think that good friend means who can share each other's emotions. There are two qualification for good emotion sharing. First, ""listen careful"". Some people just want to say more than person who is infront of them. But it is not good attitude to be good friend and share emotion. It's just ""giving"" emotion.  If you want to ""share"" emotion, you should listen to someone carefully, not just say much more. Then you can know more about your friend's thinking and emotion. 

 Second, ""good talker"". Suppose that your friend is having trouble because of himself. He wants to let you give some opinion. What will you say, ""it was your mistake. you should apologize."" or ""it was not your mistake.""? To be good talker, you should say second one beacause it helps your friend's after works. If you say first one, he can get satisfied mind. But sweets are instant thing. Bitter advice will make trust between you and him and make him say deep inside of his mind.

  We've made many relation in life. But there's not that much deep relations. You can make it by being good listener and talker. Wheather develope it or not is your choice.     "	2.5	3	2.5	8
1364	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  I think that qualities of a good friend will be different according to each person, so I can't say those are absolutely true for everyone, but  for me, my good friends have 3 good qualities.

  The first one is that they don't tell me strange jokes which make me upset. For example, when I was middle school student, there was some classmate who like sexcual jokes. As I hate that kind of jokes, I didn't like to talking with him.  My good friends know what I hate and what is the good joke for making funny circumstance. Therefore, I can feel funny when I meet my them.

  The second thing is sharing hobbies. My good friends and me usually share hobbies. We play same games and sports, watch movies and animations together. When we do same thing together, we share our emotions and opionions and that make friendship. For instance, 2 years ago, I realized my classmate like some animation which I was interested in. I started to talk with him and I could become friend with him. Watching new series of that animation together, we could be closer. Therefore I think having same interest is very important condition of good friends.

  The last one is talking friquently. My good friends talk with phone, cheating program although we can't meet. One of my firends who graduated same elementary, middle, and high school is going other university, sometimes when he has some trouble or feels boring, he call me and we meet or play games together. Thanks to that, we can keep our friendship. So I think if someone is good friend, talking is very important to keep relationship.

 In summary, I think proper joke, sharing hobbies, talking "	3.5	4	3	10.5
1365	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Most of people have a lot of friends. But Are you confident about your friends? I think that people have many friends. but some of friends are only good friends. then What is a good friend? A good friend has some qualities such about belief of friend, mind, and action. From now on I claim some of qualities of a good friend.

 First, I think that a quality of a good friend is a belief of a friend. it means that the relationship of a friend is depended on the belief of a friend. I think friend is that I can not only play with them but also talk about my thinking and my problems which are hard to talk others. so I think belief is very important and it is the base of relationship. To be a good friend, we should believe each other. So we should not talk secret about friend to others. So quality of a good friend is the belief.

 Second, I think that a quality of a good friend is a mind that think each other. It means that good friend think each other. So if friend has the problem or he is nervous, good friend know the situation. he try to help a friend. In my case, when I was hard becouse of my problem, my friend realize them and help me. It is possible because he has mind think me. So I think one of qualities of good friend is the mind that think each other.

Third, I think that a quality of a good friend is ablity that don't overstep the mark. Although they are very close firends, it has line that they should keep. So I think the ability that don't overstep the mark is very important to frein relationship. In my case, I often play hard fun with my friends. So my teacher talk to us. some fun is so hard. but while we play hard fun with my friends, we should not overstep the mark. So we keep the relationship with my friends. So  i think ability that don't overstep the mark is very impordant.

To sum up, qualities of a good friend is very various. but I think the most impordant qualities are belief, ablity that don't overstep the mark, and mind that think each other.I think if we have them, we can be a good friend. Also we can get the good friend."	3.5	3.5	2.5	9.5
1366	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Having a good friend is important factor in our life. A good friend makes our life enjoyful and meaningful. However, we seldom have some question about the meaning of a good friend. In my opinion, a good friend should have those three characteristics. A good friend can help you even though the work is very hard, a good friend and you should respect each others, and we can talk confortably anytimes.

 First of all, a good friend is a person who can help you without any reward. A good friend will help you regardless you have serious problem or he has busy work. In my case, I could make a good friends during preparing the contest. At that time, six students in our school were participated to the contest. We had only 6 days to make achievement so we had to do work during whole days. Everyone was busy to make each one's achievement, but we help each others work and talk about the way to develop each one's research. After the contest, we felt the we become more close and now I think them as my best friends. In this reason, I think a good friend is a person who help me without any reward.

 Not only that, but respect each other is also importhat factor of a good friend. A friend usually has similliar hobbies or interests, but they may have some differences too. A good friend should understand these differences. I have close friend who named jun ho. We both like soccer and games. However, I really like to stay at bed so I sometimes didn't participate to playing soccer even though jun ho called me. And he understand I like to stay at bed and watching youtube, he left me at the dormitory. In contrast, I know he like to play soccer or basketball, sometimes I called him to play sports. In this way, we could be a good friends even though we have big difference.

 Third, we can feel confortable when we talk with a good friend. A good friend hears my story with high concentration so we can talk anything I want. In my experience, I could not meet a middle school friend during the high school because I was in the dormitory. We only met at the vacation. However, even though we met 2~3 times at years, we felt confortable when we met and talk about each one's life for 3~4 hours. I think it is a great point of having a good friends.

 As a results, I think a good friend should have three point. Helping each other, understand the differences, and make each other confortable. Of course those are really hard things so making a good friend is really hard. Therefore, I think we have to consider about them and try to be a good friend of my friend. Then that friend will become your good friend."	3.5	4	3.5	11
1367	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Humans are the social animal. The humans get many strong points by communicating with other people. There are many people that communicate with us. But one of the most important people in our life is friends. Without a bad accident, we have to live for a while together with our friends. Maybe, the time that being together with your friends can be longer than your family. So, there are so many good points for being together with good friends.

 The good friends solve our social needs. Psycologist Maslow says that there are 5 levels of human's needs. According to his opinion, people want high-level needs when they solve low-level needs: eating, house and safety. Although the low-level needs are associated with surviving, high-level needs are associated with aritificial notions such as social needs or being a ethically great human. But nowadays, most of people don't worry about surviving. Most of people eat foods well, aren't homeless. So, according to Maslow's opinion, because people solve low-level needs, they want high-level needs. And the key of high-level needs is good friend. This is why the good friends are important for modern people.

 So, what are the qualities of a good friend? There are many qualities of a good friend. However, the most important quality of a good friend is listening. As I mentioned, most of modern people already solve needs about surviving. So, they don't need physical help such as money. They need mental care. Most of people's life is not just safe plane. They will meet many bad people and accident. When we meet those kind of bad things, the stress accumulate to people. And they must sometimes get out of stress out. So, many people get stress out their own way. But the best way is just saying their stress to someone. But when the speaker notice that the listener don't want to listen, they will stop speaking and their stress multiple more and more. To prevent this bad cycle, we need to listen to our friends. And you can be a good friend.

 And in my opinion, there is one more important quality of a good friend. Watching. When we live together for a long time with your friend, you can find some different feature of your friends easily. If they behave a little different, they could be getting many stress. Catch the different behave."	2	3.5	3.5	9
1368	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Although IT is developing faster and faster, people's individual relationship between each other is not developing. Technology is developing, but competetion is much harder and rate of suitciding is increasing. I think that having good friends is good way to prevent suitciding. Good friends can make him or her relax and decrease stress and live more comfortable. Then, let's notice who is a good friend.

First, a good friend should be able to help him or her when he or she is hard in not only money but also thought. People who are very hard are more and more increasing because these days' competetion is harder and harder. So, they need a good friend who can hear their stories and share their emotion. These are more and more important for harder competetion.

Next, a good friend should be trusted. People who lie and run away are increasing because of harder competetion. So, being able to be trusted is very important. A person should be able to relax because of his or her friend.

Finally, a good friend should be not emoitional in every situation. Although sharing emotion is important, people should not behave emotionally. Sometimes, they should be able to notice thier exact situation and decide what they will do. 

These are the things that a good friend should have. There are more things for a good friend, but I think these are the most important things. Let's think about if you have these. I think I need more second and third things."	2.5	3	2.5	8
1369	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Hello everyone, Do you have real good frined?I think each people have specific standard about qualities of a good friend.

But, today I want to talk about three qualities of a good friend that are my opinion.

The first thing is kindness.

There is some story about that. when I was 17years old, I forgot to bring some document for our group.

At that time someone angered to me, so I'm very envy. but, one friend said to me. ""Don't worry too much, Next time you will be better"" 

When I heard that, I got confidence and did my best to our group. 

Finally, our group got best score.

So, I think kindness is the thing that good friends have.

The second thins is giving faith.

Here some reason. When I prepare our school festival in 2018, I was captain of team of preparation. 

But, school festival term overlaped with final exam term. So, I couldn't concentrate about festival. 

At that time, I was so tired, anxious and I wanted to forget every things.

But,  My friend ""soo hyun"" understand my feelings. and she said ""You can do everything, because you always solve problems wisely.""

Because of that voice, I cought two problems.

So, I think giving faith is the thing that good friends have

The last thing is honesty.

I have a friend that talks everything to me, both good news and bad news.

Also I share my everything with him. When we shared our secret without lies, 

We felt that we were closer more and more. So, I think the most important thing that a good friend have is honesty. 

if honesty doesn't exist between friend and me, Faith and kindness couldn't exist.

So I think honesty is most important thing.

By three reason about the qualities of a good friends.

In my opinion, Honesty is most important qualitie and  kindness, giving faith is next.

So, Can you answer about "" Do you have real good friend?""

if you say ""no"", I wish you get a real friend

If you say ""yes!"", I think your life is better than others."	3	3	2.5	8.5
1370	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"You get to meet a variety of types of people in your life. Some may just pass by you, while some may give a huge impact to you. A lot of people may be you friend. However, sometimes you will fight with friends. On the other hand, some might be quite best friend for your entire life. In my opinion, to be a good friend, you and your best friend both have to get good affect and give good influence.

First, mostly significantly, I think a good friend has to be similar in thinking ways and opinions. People get to grow up in tons of environment, and all have different thoughts. It is natural to have different opinions, but at least people having opposite perspectives may not be a good friend. It is so hard to understand a person who lived through a totally different environment. On the other hand, having a similar perspective leads to understanding each others feelings well, and this is very important. Laughing at the same situation makes you feel more happier, and being angry or sad at the same situation helps you to sooth your feelings. When you are in a bad situation, friends with same thinkings help you to get a better condition. For example, when I was in high school, a student did a mistake. My friend and I argued by saying that was a terrible thing, or just a mistake. This led me and my friend as a person and person not knowing each other.

Second, not envying each other is another quality to be a good friend. If one starts to envy, there is no end. It may be in any part, such as appearance, grades, one's environment, etc. Let's say that I envy my best friend. I keep get to 비교 with my friend and when I am not better than her, I get to be low-mooded. Everytime I meet her I will be sad or bit angry at her. In the other hand, if I get to be slightly better than her, I will 무시 my friend and she will also feel it. Once ether me or my friend starts envying, I think it is difficult to talk or see one another as before. We couldn't talk about what we accomplished, and then she or he will no more be a friend, just people in competition. 

Finally, in my opinion, a good friend could help each other when one is in bad situation, and not be friends just for use. A friend means someone who you can corporate. This does not mean only understanding and encouraging each others feelings in happy situations, but to help in bad situations. This can be something related to money, or questions when studying. In this point, a good friend has to give help when the other is in bad situation. In addition, you should not always just ask for help. Asking help in really hard situations(불가피) and giving help makes a good friend. After getting help, you should be thankful too. 

My opinion of a good friend need three major qualities. A good friend has to have similar perspectives with me, should not envy each other, and help each other when one is in a bad situation. I hope you get a good friend qualified such as those reasons. It will make your life more happier."	3.5	4	3	10.5
1371	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I think this question does not have one answer. Each person will make different question about this. But I think, literally 'I' think, good friend must be honest for me.

Actually, I do not think many things in relationship with people. I just love people and be kind to them before they give scar to me. So I want to tell you why I think honest is the most important for me.

 I guess many people will say good friend must be 'kind' for me or easy to 'talk' or 'listen' carefully my worries. Well, I don't think so. Because my best friends are not kind to me or listen my voice carefully, but they are honest to me. Lie is the most big important that can ruin the realationship. I can tell my story for this reason(why the lie is most harmful).

 I use domitory when I was in high shool. In 1st grade, I met classmate who likes to lie. I think he wants to be a good friends to everyone and he tries to make others feel good. How he make them feel good? The answer is 'lie'.  He always lie to friend. For example, if A likes idol, my room mate is trying to say 'Oh, I like them too!'. And B likes another idol, then he goes to B and say 'I like this group!'. It may can help for making relationship but he wants to be a best friend to everyone. So he is finding some information about idol groups and I recognized A's favorite idol group and B's favorite idol group was rival. So he said bad things about B's group to A and A's group to B. Because my school was small, every stories can hear to each other. So A and B know about my room mate and they were fight. Like this, being kind and share same hobby is not always good for realtion ship. For A and B, my room mate was kind and funny friend but when they know it was lie, they couldn't keep their relationship.

 I siad why lie is bad for relationship, and now I want to tell you why honest is good for realtionship. In 2nd grade I met my best friend minwoo. He was very very very honest man even he tried to be a philosopher in science highschool. At first I thought he was rude, because he do not take care of others emotion and tell about truth. For example, when I get punished from teacher and I was very upset. At that time minwoo said me ""It was you're falut, If you do not make problem, teacher will not give you punishment."". It is right and I know about it, but I just want to hear ""It is not your falut"" or ""It's alright."". When I heard to minwoo, I think ""Oh..He is very rude."". But after one big problem, I can know he is very good friend to me. In 2nd grade, I was in trouble. I become the head of 2nd grade student and I have to controll all of them. In my school, 2nd grade is the most emotional grade. Because of '조기 졸업'. It is the prestige that some of student can graduate highschool early. So there was very cold atmosphere between who can graduate and can't graduate or between classes. It was vary hard to controll with them. When I agree with one, then other position said bad things about me. It was too hard to keep my feeling. One day I go to my domitory early and think about that. 'How can I do better?'. In that time minwoo come to me and tell. ""Don't try to be perfect. follow the rule hardest is not always right. Hard thing can be brake but soft thing can be avoid it. Don't blame you. You are doing great."". It was very warm. Because everyone knows minwoo does not lie. I feel better and I could do my work best. In this case, I realize that honest is the most important. Because I can trust him perfectly."	2.5	3.5	3.5	9.5
1372	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" There are two things that are the qualities of a good friend.

 First, don't taking benefits from friend is the quality of a good friend.

 There is some people who want to take benefit from friends. For example, some people want to get their friend's note taking. They don't appriciate their friends and their friends are just note taker. It means, a bad friend doesn't respect their friends and doesn't appriciate theit friends. 

 In my opinion, a good friend has to respect his friends and shares his happiness with his friends even his friends can't give a benefit to him.

 Second, giving a phone call to friend is the quality of a good friend.

 Communication is really important factor to be friend. And, there are many types to communication such as talking and phone calling. However, we have to stay with friends to talk with them. So, phone calling is important to communication. Also, giving phone call means he/she thinks their friends a lot. 

 As a result, a person who doesn't take benefits from friend and give a phone call to friend means a good friend. because It means, they love their friends with no benefits.

 So, try to give comfort to your friend and don't think about benefits from your friend. Then, you will be a good friend."	3	2.5	3	8.5
1373	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"First of all, I think good friends spend lots of time with me. Good friends hear carefully when I'm speaking, they come next to me when I'm upset or depressed, and they also happy together when I'm happy. So, they always come next to me and spend lots of time with me. So, I have lots of memory that I make with good friends even if that memory is sad memory. Second, good friends give many things. Good friends share when they are eating delicious food, and they borrow something when I need it. They share not only visible things but also invisible things. For examples, they help me when I have getting trouble or when I meet difficults problems, and they can lead me to go to correct way of my life. Also they give me knowledge that I don't know and I cna also teach them that they don't know so we both can get benefits. Lastly, they can affect my life. I can get advice them to choose job or college or company. Also I can get advice about life. And I can even get advice them to choose today's diet or movies. Such like these, they affect big and small in my life. I think good friends have those three features and I also spend efforts to be a good friend of my friends."	2.5	2.5	3.5	8.5
1374	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" We spend much time of our life with our friends. Some of our friends are maintained through our whole life. Mabye you will agree about that making good friends is one of the most important things of our life. Than, what are the qualities of a good friend? I think trust and helping are the qualities of a good friend. There are some reasons why I think so.

 First, we can make friendship based on trust. We talk our own stories such as experiences, anacdotes and secret to our close friends. We can talk our secret or bad stories to good friends because we trust each other. By talking these stories, we can make friendship and feeling that we know well each other. If some of my friends reveal my secret to someone, maybe our relationship will be spoiled.

 Second, I heard that a really good friends is a person who help me when I am in the worst situation. I completely agree with that statement. If someone make a relationship when you are in good situation such as earning lots of money and leave you  when you are in bad situation. That person is not your friend. He approach to you not yourself but benefits from your situation. If he were a good friend, he would stay and help you anytime. even if you are in the worst time.

 So, for these reason I think  trust and helping are the qualities of a good friend. By trusting we can make frienship and a good friend will help you when you are in bad situation."	4	3.5	3	10.5
1375	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I can change one important thing in my country, I change  the recognition of success . We grow up , hearing that ""you should study very hard!"".  
It results  in a thought or recognition,  studying and making much money is definition  of success. However, I do not say studying and being  a millionaire or billionaire  is not a gauge of success. There is  three reasons about it. 
First of all , almost every people  have ther  own goals which is filled with things they like and love.  However, if their goals is not matched with other's expectation, for example, to enter the best university, they become weak and give up easily ther dreams.
Best method to engage in goals they dream is to change the recognition about criterion of success.
In addition, thoughts about the success in Korea result in more complex emotional problems. People think studying is the best method to achieve goals. These thouhgts cause students to recognize their friends as competitors.
Consequently, it makes them feel complex and emotional sickness. what we should give them is not emotional tiredness but motive to achieve their goals.
Finally, changes of recognition about success can make our nation develop compared with other countries. In the world, develpment of nation can result in high nation competitiveness because many people do their best only what they want.
Thus, Korea becomes wholy developed nation in many aspect of art, literature, study and so on.
In other words, we make efforts to change the recognition of success to make our Korea be filled with people who do what they want, feel happy about around people and are skilled with their job."	4	3	3	10
1376	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"There are many problem  in my country. North ko rea is one of the most serious problems. I want to change that  when we independence  to Japan, we are not divide to north and south. There is only Korea . There are three reason.

First, there is no Korean risk . In real world,  we divided  and was doing war. Many forigen  afraid that we doing war again . So there is less travel, less  buy. In  the other hand, if Korea do  not divide, there is more less  probablity of war. Therefore, Korea can devolpe and we can live much better.  

Second, there is so many population and ground. That means there are more power in our country. More population and ground mean more resource, more scientist, engineer, writer. In resource, it is very good to devolpe region ecomomic and it can make doing something all our self. In many good people, there is some affect each other. So, Korean culture and science is more devolpe than real world.

Third, there are many culture that didn't destroy. Many culture in Korea destoried by Korean war. Korean myth don't know name of best God. If korea is not divide, there is not Korean war, So, we can see many culture of Korea.

So these reason, I want to we are not divide to north and south, because there is no korean risk, more national power than now, and we can see many culture."	3	4	2.5	9.5
1377	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"What I want to change about my country is learning material of highschool and middleschool students . And  it is because current course is too easy for much students and it downgrades the overall quality of knowledge of students. Naturally, it will be a huge obstacles  for growth of Korean Science . Since I think education of talented people will be the key of future, the education of my country is the very thing I want to change.
My logic starts with importance of education in Republic of Korea. Unfortuatley,  my country has a few geological and social penalties  in global relationship. The country itself is not large and natural resources are limited. Also all  of the other countries next to Republic of Korea, such as Japan, China, and North Korea, have huge impacts. Therefore our deplomatics are very complex, and it is hard to get a source that brings sure benefits such as oli  industry in middle-east Asia or agriculture in the United States. 
As a solution for the problem, my country had found some solutions. At 70's we studied heavy industries and manufacturing, and resently cultural industries like k-pop and semi-conducter technolagies are also became a good source. However, all of these have some problems to be permenant. First of all, for most technolagies, lack of capitals will be a long-term problem. It is clear that study on leading-edge technolagies costs a lot of money. Considering the speed and efforts on the field of superpowers like China, we can find out that it will be a tough competition for us. Most problems of cultural industry is that the lifetime of it is very short. For now, famous artists like BTS brings a lot of benefits but we cannot expect a lot from them; in aspect of economics.
Therefore, I think high-quality technolageis and scientists who can realize them will be very important for my nation. However, the cuccrent goverment's policies are not stimulating, but restricting growth of students. Materials are being downgraded and it is limiting logical thinking of stuedents. Special schools for talented students are being offended, expecially in a social way using fake news."	4	3.5	4	11.5
1378	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change one  important thing about our country, I want to change the situation between the North Korea. In detail, I want our country to unificate  with North Korea in peaceful way. There are several reasons.
 First of all, If we unificate with North Korea, we will get some economic benefit . Some people says  we will lose more than gain, but I think they don't know well . Of course, in the beginning, we will lose our money to help people in North Korea. But, we have to think with longer time . If we unificate, we don't need to waste our taxes to remain the army like now . Also, in North Korea, there are lots of fuels  under the ground. We can help each other by covering other's weekness .
 Second, we don't have to fear about the possibility of war. In North Korea, there are neclear weapons. Because of that, not only our country but also other countries surrounding us are worried about the war. There are several problems caused by this. Although many years passed through after the Korean war, US have many rights about army in our country.(of course it's not just because of this reason) Also, we had a conflict with China because of applying THAAD.
 The last reason is people. there are people who are forced to seperate with their family. they couldn't see each other about 70 years. If unification comes true, they can meet each other. And we have to think people who are living in North Korea. , they suffered from their country. they don't have any free in there.
 In conclusion, I want our country to unificate with North Korea, if I could change one thing about our country. we will get some economic benefits and the peace."	4	4.5	3.5	12
1379	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"As you know,  I live in South Korea. South Korea is usually called 'S trong IT country' because it has high technology  in internet and also  people can use this high quality internet well .  As our  country has high quality internet, we can have many internet users and many kinds of internet cultures. Today I want  to change south korea's  negative comment, the most nkown  well negative face of internet culture . 
I have a two  reasons why i  prevent korea's negative comment. The first reason is that the grade of negative comment is very bad. In this year, almost 4 very famous celebrity  is suicided  because of negative comment.  This case show  that negative comment  of Korea is very low grade  and it has many personal attack and sexual bad words.  I was so angry that they died by personal attack which form many , unkown person. Even now we enter the youtube  in Korea server, we may can see many negative comment which cross the line. 
The second reason is that Korean law can't punish negative comment hardly. Korean law of punish negative comment is so weak and As bad commenter know that, many bad commenter write terrible personal attack without the worry of punishment.  
I think we can prevent bad comment that we think once when we write comment, check that my comment has personal attack and sexual bad words.  We also change the law of bad comment in Korea stronger to prevent bad commeter. 
I want to develop high-tech-program which judge that the commet is bad comment then delete the bad comment"	3.5	4	2.5	10
1380	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I think our country  Korea have  many good points in many sections . There are many smart people, well advanced democracy,  good public peace, and so on. But, if I can  change one important thing about my country, I want to change the location  of my country. Because of some reasons. 
First, there are no ways to go other countries on road . The east, west, and south of Korea, there is ocean  that we can't go with car or on foot. Also, in the north, there is North Korea, and normal person  can't go to North Korea. Because of this, we need to take airplane  or ship to go to another country. It means not only people but we can't use trains or car to trade cargo with another country so that it needs too long time to get goods from other countries . Of course, when North Korea and South Korea become one country, we can linked  with Trans Siberian Railway, and other highway , but we don't know when it will be. So, I want to change the location when I can change one thing about my country. 
Second, East Asia is important for each communist countries like People's Republic of China, and democratic country like America. There was cold war between these countries some decades ago, and because of this, there are two government in Korea penisula. In Northern side, there is communist government, and in southern, there is democratic government. So, there are US army in South Korea, and they try to increase power in East Asia. However, China don't want America to expanse power in East Asia. In South Korea, there is not much natural resources, tourist attractions, trade is the only way the trade to economic benefit so that we want to get both american market, and chinese market, the biggest market in the world. So, when Korea is in other location, I think we don't need to notice China, and America than now.
In conclusion, when I can change one important think about my country, I want to change a location of country, because we can move other country easily, and we don't need to notice other countries that much."	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5
1381	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If i  could change one thing about South Korea, I would change something about education .  In Korea, every students  has to study more than 9 years at school. Teachers teach lots of  subjects such as Korean, Math, English, Science, etc . People think Korean, English, Math  are most important subjects among the many subjects that teach in school , because Universities think like that. So many students study only for University, not for their future or dream. I think that a lot of student nearby me  thought university could figure out their future and dreams , and their parents make them think like that. There are many friends whose grade is top in their school, but few friends have their specific dream.  Many students dont have their dream . They just study. I'm so sad about it.  They never have chace to study what they really want to study.  Korean people want to get safety job, so they think that Being hiring in big company like samsung is the best job. What they want to be, what they want to do is not important because they believe big money makes happiness. Many parents say their kids,""You should do what you have to do rather than what you want to do, and you can be happy"".  Never. Human can be happy when he does what he wants. But in Korea, students only have chance to study about English, math, etc. And school teach too much things not to be useless in students life. There are some special school for fashion or beauty, etc, but people think the students of the schools are not good students. People think students have to study. I want to change about education and i want to make people respect all of things students want to do."	3	2	2.5	7.5
1382	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Where are you living, apartmenet  or a single house? I think some of you are in KAIST dormitory , but most of  you and your family are living in apartment. This is because Korea's population density is too high. Korea's land is peninsular, so 3 face of land is facing to sea. I think this terrain is so beautiful, but just  I think the land size is too small. Therefore, I want to change our country's land size with  several reasons. 
 First, I mentioned before , population density will become low . When population density is high, lot's  of problems appear. For example, traffic problems, house problems including apartments problem like inter-floor problems . When our land become larger, these problems will be gone. My romance, living in big single house can be real. 
 Second, there would be lot's of natural resources. Fuel is most important material in our society. However, in Korea, there are no fuels in our land. So we buy them in very high prize. When we have larger land, fuel existing probability will be high, so Korea's economy will grow faster.
 Lastly, argriculture technology will be develop. In case of US, there are lot's of big farms using there large land. So, US's agriculture technology is high. This is because, there are lot's of demands, so government can highly support this technology. When Korea's land become larger, there will be lot's of farms too and our agriculture technology can develop.
 In conclsion, I would change Korea's land size because population density, natural resources and agriculture technology. I think country's land size is very important element in econcomy. In very far future, I hope Korea's land uplift by crustal movements, and become larger land."	3.5	5	2.5	11
1383	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change one, I will going  to change the president , or to say the chief of the one country . The leader of one's country have  its good power to change its nation. Let me example this on  the Korea. TH e President Park,  which  has  geartly  developed the k orea's economy, had made the fundamental  that Korea could thrive and become the wealthy  country. But both , we tried to be the dictator changing the  law. The democracy held its power during that time. Only one person could be very substential of the country's extrinsic part( economy, military, diplomacy, etc.)
Also, can have effect  on intrinsic part (like country's image, society's thoughts). I know one example of this intrinsic change caused by one person on Korea. The daughter of President park that I have said earlier, had become president, like her father. And see  had in very big trouble showing  off  her incapability doing the work of one's nation. THe result brought disappointment and despair to the teenagers and the lad of the Korea. Lots of people had seen dark side of society and showed anger and grief.
Now, she left and new president came to his throne. And, I don't think he is doing good job on many part. However, I was surprised that he had made very unreasonable decision of the energy industry, to say De-Nuclear powerplant project. He said he had felt the danger of the nuclear power after watching 'the movie' which doesn't contain any scientific information.
By his decision, nulcear oriented industries and the studying groups became helpless waiting the goverment's declarement. Korea's nuclear powerplant technologies are losing its futuer and having the dark age. And the cost for used electricity is going up and up. One person brought this result.
The leader of one nation should be well known about lots of things including the diplomcy, military, economy. And one of the most important thing is the energy politics.
If the chief of one nation is having bad decisions about it, the people deserves to change one important thing, the president."	3.5	3	2	8.5

1401	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    After we enter KAIST, we all receive our own student card. It has many functions. We can borrow some books in library, use this like check card, and enter dormitory with this card. But sometimes we forget to bring our student card . Then we can't enter the 

dormitory without anyone's help. It is quite annoying. So I think KAIST should change our dormitory enter system from card to fingerprint. 

    First, it is more effective to protect some criminal invading our dormitory. Criminal can steal our wallet. If criminal steal our wallet, criminal can have our student card too. Then criminal can enter our dormitory, and it is quite dangerous. Criminal can steal our 

wallet, but he(or she) can't steal out fingerprint. So fingerprint dormitory enter system is less dangerous than student card dormitory system.

    Second, we can easily forget to bring the student card or lose it. When I was in school, I forgot to bring my wallet when I went to listen the lecture. I think many students have the same experience like me. After the lecture over, I can't enter the dormitory 

without my friend's help. It can cause time waste, so I think this is ineffective. But we don't have to worry about forget to bring the fingerprint or loose the fingerprint. So it doesn't cause time waste. So fingerprint dormitory enter system is more time effective 

than student card dormitory system. 

    Finally, our dormitory teacher don't have to stay awake at midnight. Because most of KAIST students are 19 years old or more, they can enjoy alcohol at midnight. After their happy alcohol time, they have to enter dormitory to sleep. But sometimes they 

don't bring their student card. There are no other students in midnight, so the student can't enter without dormitory teacher's help. For this kind of students, dormitory teacher should awake at midnight. But if we can enter dormitory with fingerprint, dormitory 

teacher don't have to worry about that kind of student and he(or she) can get a sleep. So fingerprint enter system also helps dormitory teacher.

    In summary, many of KAIST students and me feel uncomfortable when we enter the dormitory. If we change our dormitory enter system from card to fingerprint, we can protect us by invade of criminal, we can enter the dormitory when we forget to bring 

the student card or lose it, and our dormitory teacher don't have to stay awake at midnight. So I think KAIST should change our dormitory system from card to fingerprint."	4.5	3.5	4	12
1402	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   Various polices and programs exist in my university, KAIST. But, some of these properties can limit abilities of students. University is the place to rainforce the problem-solving power of students. Research participation program for freshmen lacked in my university. This property limit the ability of students. So if I can, I will establish this reserch participation program for freshmen in my university.

      By establishing this, students experience will be significantly increases. Students can start experiencing researches and experiments from the first grade. Experiences are important to grow dreams of students. Also, the experiences of students are directrly related to their problem-solving power. Therefore, this program will provide important experiences to students.

      Also, it will motivate the students. The experiences gives confidence to them. In addition, it help them to set their direction of their life. Moreover, students can easily get urge from motivation, and this is the object of the every universities. Therefore, this program will help students to grow up with their motivation.

      As we saw in here, research participation program for freshmen has many positive effects. It provides the important experiences to studens. Also, It motivates students, and students can get urge easily from this program. In conclusion, if I can, I will establish the research participation program for freshmen in my university."	4	4	3	11
1403	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    A lot of students and professors of KAIST have been given their accounts for many website of KAIST and used it. Thus, we can use e-mail system, KLMS, and so on. However, there is no cloud system, such as Google Drive. Some people may think that it is not necessary for members of KAIST because we can use Google Drive. However, I think it is necessary for members of KAIST for following three reasons.

    First, other cloud system or Google Drive have the stroage limit, so we have to pay for it. In many case, cloud systems which are run by companies require us to pay for using full storage of the cloud system. Therefore, if we use such system for working with other members of KAIST, we have to purchase the membership tickets to access full storage. However, it can be a big barrier to do some experiments or projects well because there are usually many cases that we have to deal with lots of data. Also, if KAIST offers its own cloud system, we don't need to use lots of money for the companies since KAIST is not a company. Thus, it is economically better way for KAIST to offer cloud system. 

    Second, if KAIST offers cloud system for KAIST members, it will be more efficient because we don't need to make additional accounts for other companies' websites. Imagine that your project group decide to use a cloud system of a company. Then all of your group members have to make their accounts for the company's cloud system. However, it is just wasting for time and efforts since we have to make and manage it. Also, we have already accounts of KAIST's website, we don't need to make additional account if KAIST offers cloud system. Furthermore, the privacy problem is a big issue nowadays. Thus, it will be more safe if we do not make additional accounts for other companies.

    Lastly, we can efficiently use the cloud system of KAIST only for the working or doing researches. We already have other e-mail accounts, such as G-mail or Naver Mail, but we usually use KAIST's mail system for working or studying. For example, we do not use G-mail for submitting assignments but use KAIST's mail system. The reason is that we don't want to open our personal information to other people and just use it for working or studying. If we use Google Drive, other people of a class or project group can see our personal information through the G-mail accounts because it is related with other system, such as YouTube. Also, it will help us to concentrate only on studying or working because KAIST accounts do not give any other website system for fun.

     In summary, although some people may not think it is necessary for KAIST members, I think it will be very helpful to us. Other cloud system of usual companies do not offer full stroage and require us to purchase it, and it is not economically efficient. Also, we can protect our personal information because we don't need to make additional accounts and use it only for the studying and working. Therefore, I hope that KAIST makes our own cloud system as soon as possible."	4.5	4.5	4	13
1404	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   Many universities in the world do online class because of COVID-19. My university is no exception. Many students take the class at home, and others take the class in the dormitory. So, I think the online classes have many problems and I will write some problems with details.

   First, in online, students can't take the class better than offline class. In online class, the classes' concentration may be decreasing, so some students watch Youtube, Facebook by phone in class time. Even there are some recoreded classes' students just click the play button without watching the recorded class. However students who want to take the class with ardor are no exception. They want to take the class with ardor but the claases are not prepared better than offline class. So, I think most students can't take the class properly.

   Second, online exam can make many cheating problems. In offline exam, the professor and the students must be in the same class so students can't cheat easily. But In online exam, the professor and the students are in the different place so students can cheat easily. For example, the students who are cheating are discovered last exam. So, I think online exam can make cheating problems and I think online exam system will be reinforced.

   Finally, students ask for the professor or TA is not easy. In class, the QnA is existed but using the QnA is very burdened. Because most students can see the question who ask. Although students have the many questions, asking the question for the professor of TA is not easy.

   In conclusion, I think online classes have many problems and it would be better if above problems are be solved. I wish the problems are eased and I want to take the class in better way."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1405	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Almost every students in university should take mid term and final term exam to get grades. Students should take part in the class on announced time. In my case, some classes such as general physics take exam in 9am to 12am, some classes such as calculaus 2 take exam in 7pm to 10pm. Although only 2 cases were cited above, it is clear that exam time is extremely different. This causes unconfortable. So if i could change on important thing about my university, I would change exam time policy that every subject should take exam within from 1pm to 7pm.

  First of all, 1pm to 7pm is the best period for students to take exam in perfect condition. Many students do their tasks such as studying and writing reports in the midnight. So if exams begin too early, students can't take exam in good condition due to lack of sleep. Beginning exam in late night is also not recommened. Because, there isn't enough time for students to study for following exams after they submitted their answer sheet. 

  Second, students can conduct regular cycle during exams. To take exam, reviewing class meterials like lecture note or KLMS is necessary. This costs plenty of time. If exam period is not coherenced, there would be not enough time to study for next exams, which leads students studying whole night without enough sleep. This makes negative cycle. If exam time would be coherenced, problems above would be fixed.

  In conclusion, I want to change exam period for two reasons. That is, it helps for students to build regular life cycle and to take exam in good condition."	4.5	4.5	4	13
1406	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In these days, there are may tries to change energy source from carbon to natural energy source such as sun, wind, and wave. This is because of Globalwarm. However, the car which use oil restrict to use too. I think that all action restrict economy and science's advance. So I don't want to occur Glovalwarm for 3 reasons.

Firsrt of all, Globalwarm damage nature. Many plant and animals run away form there home because of environment changing. For example, penguine live on the ice in north polar, however effect of Globalwarm make ice melt. Penguine lost their home.

Second, if Globalwarm disappear, we can use oil unlimitly. This part is good for our economy. According to Aramco, which is the biggest oil company in the world, we can use oil until over 60 years. Oil is more cheaper than any energy source. Since Korea is industy nation, It help to enprove nation economy.

Finally, we don't afried of the sea level increasing. According to UN, there are many city will sink in the sea in future. In adittion, many islands in pecific ocean will sink in 2030. If Glabalwarm did not occur, that happening would not occur. In additional, I can save lot of money to move or protect cities. 

To sum up, If Globalwarm is disappeared, we will get many benefit. Firsrt, we can protect nature. Second, we can use oill instead of any energy source. Last, we never afried of the sea level increasing. So I strongly wish Globalwarm do not occur., if I can change one thing in universe.. And then, our life became better than before.

1407	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"        KAIST is the best university in Korea. However, it is not a perfect university. Like all of the thing does, KAIST also has some insufficiency. So, If I could change one important thing about my university, I would increase lectures of humanities like a psychology, a literature, philosophy, and  reading classic books. First, humanities lecture in KAIST are too small in number. KAIST has some general class, but most of them are consisted with English lecture, Economics, or something which is slightly different with humanities. There are some humanities lecture like introduction of psychology and history lectures, but this is not enough. I felt that there are too few options for every enrollment time. Second, lots of the KAIST students lack humanities ability. Not all of the students, but most of the students of KAIST avoid the humanities. And, most of them didn't learn enough humanities even in highschool, because they graduated science high school or a school for gifted children. These schools focus on student's mathematics skill and science skill more than humanities. So, the university needs to teach them. Finally, humanities are essential to modern times. Nowadays, scientists and researchers have to cooperate with each other. And they need to study about both human and technology during development of the A.I. In this situation, humanities is the best way to understand about human, and sympathize with other person. To sum up, KAIST needs more lectures of humanities, because of a shortage of courses, the student's lack of humanities ability, and necessity of humanities ability in mordern times. So, I would solve this problem, if I could change one important thing about my university. "	4.5	3.5	4	12
1408	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     Many university students have their own problems. They can be something about their friend relationship, or something about studying, ect. Also I have some problems in my university life. In this essay, I want to talk about the thing I want to change in KAIST. Above all, I want to change the basic courses. Actually, I want to reduce burden of the basic courses and also want to let students to choose their own basic courses.

     First, inappropriate basic courses reduce students' will of studying. This problem is said by not only students but also some professers. Every first-grade students have  to take all basic courses, except some students who already learned them in highschool. Because of it, many of freshman spend their whole year to finish their basic courses. Of course, each students have their own field and their favorite subjects are different. It means that students must take courses that they doesn't like. For example, one may love chemistry but hate physics. However, this student have to take General Physics 1 and 2 in whole year, just because it is basic courses to graduate. This student should be depressed by them before entering her major studying.

     Second, some basic courses don't have relationship in some majors. Some basic courses are never used in some field. For instance, in General Physics 2, students learn about the electromagnetic phenomenas with complex mathematical skills. Also they have to learn about relativity and quantum science. But this stuffs are rarely used in some field, for example, industrial designing. It is a slightly different problem from my first reason. This is not about students' interest. It is about efficient learning of students. Frankly, taking courses that they will never use can be time wasting. In this point of view, I think students have to choose some basic courses in their own fields, not taking all field's courses. 

     To summarize, I think KAIST should reduce the burden about basic courses and repect students' own fields. Because inappropriate basic courses reduce students' will of studying and also it doesn't have relationship with students' major. If students can take their own basic courses by choosing their interesting fields, students will fell happy in basic courses and be able to make stronger will of studying. Also, their own basic courses will help them in major studying. "	5	4.5	3.5	13
1409	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Most classes at KAIST are conducted in English. Of course, English classes to foster global students are great, but I think it would be better if some classes were divided into English classes and Korean classes.

 First, in English class, some professors' lectures are a little bad. Since many professors at KAIST are Korean, many students felt that when the professor explain in Korean rather than English, their teaching skills become much better. For example, in general physics class, it was much easier to understand when the professor explained the same concept in Korean, even though I know the English word.

 Secondly, it is difficult for students to study. When all the classes were conducted in English, I felt that my concentration was very low. Also, the efficiency of studying was not as good as studying in Korean. It is not appropriate that all classes are Korean, but for some classes, I think that having classes in Korean as well as in English will help students studying.

 Finally, for most Korean students, some elective classes, such as philosophy and psychology introductions, do not have to be taught in English. This is because students often take elective classes to build up their humanities knowledge. For example, in my case, the introduction to economics class was divided into English class and Korean class, and I could choose the Korean class to understand and learn concepts accurately.

 In conclusion, due to better lectures, students' studies, and the need for the Korean language in some electives, I think KAIST classes should be divided into English and Korean classes."	3.5	4.5	4	12
1410	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     Everybody maybe imagine that they change something in their university and so did I. If I have chance to change one imporant thing about my university, I would change the policy that all classes must use not Korean but English. This policy is very unique policy that only exist in KAIST, my university. Although there are no foreigner in class, all classes should use only English. I think it is so unnecessary policy. I have three reason for my opinion.

     First, it is hard to understand perfectly. A lots of students are not good at English, so they cannot understand the lecture perfectly. They cannot help to miss somee parts in the lecture. Thus students only understand the contents superficially. It is not helpful to foster competitive students.

     Second, it is hard to communicate with professors. Not only students but also professors are not good at English, so I can see that professors and students cannot understand each other. It lower the quality of the lecture. 

     Finally, It wastes lots of time. There is English Camp and many English class to enhance the English ablity of students. However, according to many students, there is no effect on English ablity advancement. Therefore, the classes would be more efficient if the classes use Korean. 

     In summary, the policy that all classes must use only English is unnecessary because it is hard to understand perfectly, it is hard to communicate with professors well, and it wastes lots of time. For these reasons, I want to change that policy to use both Korean and English. If we changed the policy like that, many students will be satisfied with lectures."	4.5	4.5	4	13
1411	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   KAIST is a college focused on science and technology, and students in KAIST have great skills in their fields of study. Also, since the establishment of KAIST, the researchers in the college has achieved an astonishing amount of advancement in science and technology. In spite of the strengths KAIST has, it is still in need of improvements in several aspects.

    First, students in KAIST have relatively weak knowledge in humanity and social science. The majority of students in KAIST have graduated from high schools that heavily focus on science and technology, and they have a great knowledge and skills in those fields. However, it is also true that their level of knowledge in humanity and social science is relatively low because they have concentrated their time in high school mostly on studying science and technology. Because the knowledge in humanity and social science is an important aspect of job applicants these days, the staff in KAIST should find a way to upgrade the students' knowledge on humanity and social science.

    In addition, the connection between KAIST members is not strong when compared to other colleges. The members in KAIST are usually private-minded, and they have a tendency of not interfering with each other unless they are required to do. This liberal atmosphere is a strength of KAIST, but it also acts as a downside because of the lack of connection between KAIST members. The lack of connection between KAIST memebers can have an adverse effect when they work in companies, since the evaluation of individual company employee is highly affected by the connection between university graduates. Hence, the college should try to improve the interaction between KAIST members.

    Finally, the geographical location of KAIST is not favorable to many undergraduate applicants. KAIST is located in Daejeon, which is remote from the capital city of Korea, Seoul. To many undergraduate, colleges in Seoul are favorable because, in there, they can enjoy the city life as well as the campus life. Due to this reason, the majority undergraduate applicants choose Seoul National University over KAIST when they get approval from both colleges. For KAIST to be more attractive to those applicants, the campus should be progressive moved closer to Seoul.

    In conclusion, KAIST should be changed in various points. First, the knowledge of students in humanity and social science should be fostered. Second, the members of KAIST should have strong connections. Finally, the campus of KAIST should be moved closer to Seoul."	3.5	4.5	4	12
1412	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   KAIST, our university, has many differences from other universities. First of all, KAIST is the Institute of Science and Technology, with only departments with natural science and engineering. There are many departments in KAIST such as mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, physics, and more. Freshmen in KAIST go to School of Freshmen which they can study basic subjects of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and programming. Students in KAIST choose their major subject as they go to second grade. The purpose of the School of Freshmen is to give opportunity to explore many subjects. I think this is the biggest difference compared to other universities. In spite of School of Freshmen provides opportunity of exploring many subjects to students, I think there are more disadvantages of School of Freshmen. If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I would like to change the system of School of Freshmen.

   First, there are many students who have already decided their major subject. In my case, I am interested in computer science, so I have decided to go to School of Computing even before the admission. I think some basic subjects such as mathematics and English are essential for all majors, but some subjects such as physics, chemistry, and biology might not be helpful unless the student choose the related major. It might be a waste of time to students who have already decided the major. Furthermore, these students would like to study more about subjects they are interested in. Basic subjects which are mandatory might make students harder to study their interested subjects.

   Second, taking all classes of basic subjects might cause bad effects on student's grade. Every student has their own subject of confidence. Some student might have talent in mathematics, but the student might be poor in other subjects such as chemistry. In my case, I am confident with subjects of programming, but I am not good at chemistry. The system about learning all basic subjects might make student's grade lower.

   Finally, systems in School of Freshmen is not the only way to explore many majors. The main purpose of School of Freshmen is to explore many majors and to help students choose their major. However, studying all basic subject might make the students lose their interest. There are department briefing session which students can get information about the major. I think the department briefing session is more beneficial for students to choose their major.

   In conclusion, for these reasons, I think there are more disadvantages of system in School of Freshmen. So I would like to change the system about School of Freshmen. Having many department briefing sessions earlier might solve this problem."	5	4.5	4	13.5
1413	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   In MIT, there is the ""Infinity corridor"" which connect every buldings so that you can reach anywhere just walking there. It seems like ""Endless load"" in KAIST, but the main difference is that first one is at indoor, and second one is in outdoor. In this point of the view, I want to change a little but it might be needed enormous construction. If can I change one thing about KAIST, I'm going to create another ""Infinity corridor"" at KAIST with three reasons.

   The first advantage of building those corridor is that we can prevent wet our body by heavy rain. I believe approximately all students at KAIST have soaked their shoese when they go to have lunch or dinner at freshmen. At that time, those people usually said, ""How great if we can move in corridr so that we don't need to worry about rain."" We can achieve that hope by creating the corridor which connect every building at KAIST.

   Next, we can make various friends because of these corridor. We don't visit where is not relate out department, so our network of friends is inevitably limited, However, if we can face someone who you don't know ever in many time at those corridor, we can make one more friend in those.

   Finally, just connecting several department and laboratory, we can get inspiration from where we didn't imagine. Hyun Joon Yoo, who are the professor of architecture, said ""In my opinion, infinity corridor cause MIT has lots of people who are recieved Novel Prize."" It is not amazaing someone did great work and he got impression from where seems to have no relationship with thier work. Since anyone could see what they do in other majors, they could combine those and their thinking. Therefore, it guides to higher level of creativity.

   In conclusion, if we create the second ""Infinity corridor"" at KAIST, we will catch the three point. The safe zone from rain, making various friends, and creativity. I hope those thing is created as soon as possible."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1414	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    KAIST is one of the best universities in Korea, especially in science and engineering. Many students in KAIST are very talented in their mojors and they enjoy what they study. So in my opinion, my university is quite good in Korea. But I think the location of KAIST makes it disattractive for high school students and undergraduations. There are some reasons why the location of KAIST is the most important thing to change.

    First, lots of undergraduations and high school students who want to come KAIST are live in Seoul. Actually, Daejeon is quite close to Seoul, but students living in Seoul can't go to school everyday because it is too far to go to school everyday. Lots of universities in Seoul like SNU, Yonsei, Korea university or other universities which are famous in Korea are located in Seoul, so many students in Seoul can go to these universities by subway, bus, or bike. But in KAIST, which is located in Daejeon, lots of undergraduations have to live in dormitory and can't go to their home everyday. So if KAIST were located in Seoul, many students could go to their home everyday and it would very comfortable then living in dormitory.

    Second, in Seoul, students can meet lots of friends. There are so many universities in Seoul, so students can make friends that go to other universities easily. Some students who live in Seoul can meet their high school students easily. Furthermore, lots of undergraduations who don't live in Seoul can meet their high school freinds or local friends easily. Because in Seoul, lots of universities are in there, so although students don't live in Seoul, they can meet there. So if KAIST were in Seoul, many students could meet lots of friends so they will be more sociable.

    To sum up, there were two reasons why relocating KAIST is important. First reason was that many KAIST students live in Seoul, so relocating KAIST to Seoul can make lots of students to go home everyday. Also, they don't have to live in dormitory. And the second reason was students can meet lots of friends in Seoul because there are lots of universities. They can not only make new friends easily, but also they can meet high school friends easily. So I think relocating KAIST to Seoul is very important."	4	4.5	3.5	12
1415	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" In KIAST, all freshmen have to use the north dormitory with random friends whole one year. Freshman cannot choose which dormitory and room they would like to live in, and cannot live with friend who wants to live with. This system has positive aspects. For example, it encourages freshman to make other new friends during first year of school. But I think this dormitory system makes some problems. There are two points that make me having negative opinion about our dormitory system.

 First, we can make friends through outside of dormiotry. The main points of our dormitory system is that freshman can make new college friends in dormitory by living together. But most of students make only one or two roommate friends, and they usually make friends by having same club, doing same activities in school, and taking same class. And through these process, students can meet more various students in school than dormitory. So, I think there are many good ways to make friends even though freshmen live individually.

 Second, all students' needs are different. There are so many dormitory buildings and various types of room. We can choose the location of dormitory, and how many friends we want to live with from second year students. But our dormitory system only regulates freshmen to choose. Some freshmen also want to live individually, or some freshmen like to live with friends. Also, some freshman want to live the north dormitory which is close to E11, but some freshmen want to live the west dormitory even though it is far from other buildings because of insects problem. Therefore, I think our dormitory system has to give chance to freshmen, so freshmen also live comfortably during freshman year.

 To summarize, KAIST students can make lots of friends without dormitory and all students' needs are different. Because of these facts, I think our dormitory system has to be changed like giving chance to choose dormitory to freshmen, and also not mendatory to live in dormitory. If it change this way, freshmen could live more comfortably in dormitory during whole school years."	4	4	3	11
1416	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    KAIST is an university which is well known as hard to enter. To enter KAIST, students need very high score from their high school, so most of the students study hard before they enter KAIST. After entering the KAIST, to get great score in the university, they keep study hard. But, I my thinking, KAIST can remove it's ABC grade system. Rather than that, I recommend to chage grade system as pass/Fail system for all subjects and I will explain why pass/fail need to us with three reasons.

    First, we can get useful information from the internet, or we can use our computer. Students have to memorize all the information to take a test. However, we can also find all the information on the internet. We can search and use any kinds of information at any time. Memorizing all the data, equation, or order will not be useful in the future. Also, we have computer which can execute calculation much faster than us. We don't need to calculate ourselves, so we just need to know how we can calculate. By developing the technology than before, we can use computer as very various way. So it isn't necessary to memorize all the information. I think we don't need ABC grade to evaluate the students memorizing or calculating ability.    

    Second, students can experience various activity. If we don't need to effort to memorize all the things that in the lecture, we can undergo more various experience. Many KAIST students can't join in some project because of study. Experience is more important than knowledge. So I think many students have to watch and feel many kind of experiences. Changing grade system as pass/fail will permit students to use their time more usefully.  

    Finally, there will be no stress. I'm very worried some students who are felt very hard because of their grade. I think every students in KAIST can be well when they go society. ABC grading system is the main reason which disturb students happiness. We have ability to control ourself, so I think pass/fail system can be work.

    In conclusion, we can use our computer and internet, students need more experience, and stress will be disappear, so I want to change grade system as pass/fail rather than ABC system. This change is very amazing, but it will bring more innovative change to our university."	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5
1417	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     KAIST is following several different ways of operating from other ordinary universities. Most of them make students feel more comfortable. But given the current state of affairs, I think the most important thing to change is naturally the damage to schools caused by COVID-19. To be honest, it is difficult to find the school's own shortcomings when it hasn't been a year and even that has not been in normal college. I will talk about the two problems caused by COVID-19 from the school and students' positions. 

     First, it is difficult to meet people in school normally. Almost all classes are non-face-to-face, which has reduced the number of students to team projects, resulting in fewer exchanges between students. Students in the same class should get closer and expand their relationships, which has become impossible because of the COVID-19.

     Second, every action becomes cautious. Of course, the most important thing is not to get a COVID-19 by thoroughly preventing it and making wearing a mask a part of daily life. But these things make others feel uncomfortable in living their lives. At one time, there were many posting criticizing various organizations that ate out or engaged in face-to-face actvities in the commumity. I thought it wasn't such a big problem, but I couldn't express my opinion because I was afraid of people's eyes and mouths. I hope that when I go out to eat with my friends, I don't go out looking around after COVID-19.

     In conclusion, COVID-19 changes all of things in our life to negative direction. I don't want this time to come again, when people are not able to meet, and when they are criticized. At next semester, I hope to see people take off their mask and take classes in the classroom by offline."	3.5	4.5	4	12
1418	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Because of COVID-19, students who enter KAIST this year didn't experience amazing noise and dense population in kaimaru. But anyone who has lived in KAIST campus would experience this disorder. I even felt afraidof eating at KAIST restaurant. I think more restaurants should be made in KAIST. There are some reasons.

 First, the numbr of restaurant is too small compared to the number of people. There are less than 20 restaurants in KAIST, and only 6 restaurants in kaimaru. In contrast, there are more than 3000 undergraduates alone. There is fixed class time, so their lunch time is all same(11:45 ~ 13:00). So many students are concentrated in restaurants and lined up for several minutes to receive food. After barely receiving the food, they have to eat in a noisy and complex environment.

 Second, menu is so simple. KAIST is geographically hard to get out. we should ride a bike or take a taxi to get out the campus. So most of students eat 3 meals a day in KAIST, every day. But as I mentioned, there are only few restaurants. So there is a limit to what we can eat and we should eat menu that we had not long ago. if new restaurants are constructed, students can select menu and enjoy various foods.

 To sum up, now there are only few restaurants in kAIST, so many students have a hard time. They should line up, eat with noise, eat same food. So I strongly make an opinion that KAIST should make more restaurants to solve these problems. "	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5

1420	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I like KAIST students. They are so smart and briliant. But if I have something to change about them, I want to change their attitude. KAIST students tend to talk about something after they know about it well enough to show others. I think it is not so bad because it makes them more perfect. However, I think it would be better that they have some confidence even when they talk about somthing they are not used to.

 First, We can hear many thoughts than before. If only someone who has perfect knowledge and flawless opinion can give a talk about something, we can only hear from few people. For example, even if a student does not have certain opinion about school students' government policy, he or she can poll to someone. The fact that I'm not perfect doesn't mean my opinion does not matter.

 Second, the attitude is important when a student starts to go into a new field. Everyone is not used to that field at the first time. I think improvement goes faster when the person has many experiences in the part. And the best way to do is just doing it. If you're scared of stepping into the new field, you cannot go further. The attitude to be perfect stops students doinng new things.

 Third, expressing something without any confidence is very important in knowing myself. Our mind is not deterministic. It is not discrete. So I think KAIST students are often not used to express their minds just because they don't know about themselves well. But, trying to show their thoughts is very important to establish their emotion and thoughts. Doing so, students can see themselves more frequently, and it is the basic of knowing myself better.

 I want to change KAIST students' attitude to express their minds without any perfect confidence because everyone should be heard from others, it is important to go to a new field, and it is good in knowing myself. Today, how about reviewing your attitude? I want you to have such attitude."	4	4.5	4.5	13
1421	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     KAIST is famous as one of the great engineer/science universities in Korea. Many students who like science and engineer wants to enter it. because it can provide them with high-quality education. Even though all people and media say like that, I think it is not good like what they think. I think it should change the grading criteria from relative ABC to absolute S/U.

     First, the actual purpose of university is not dividing students into two groups, students who can solve exam prblems well or not. For example, one student learned the concepts of certain mathematical area but failed to solve exam well due to the hard calculation. The student may get not good grade. Do you think it is right? Also, some people say that the caluclation is also the purpose of the subject. However, we can only remember a little concepts and forget others like specific calculation or tricks for only that subject. I think that it is the most important that a student learns and remembers the concepts and connections between knowledges on the studying area. They can help the student beyond the subject when the student learns or studies harder subjects. We want to be not the machine of solving exam but the human who can create or invent new concept from knowledges.

     Second, students must be exhausted due to the competition of grade. On relative ABC, students just study for pushing off other students to survive. Of course, competition sometimes courage students to study more. However, now it is wasted for students having hard burden. You can see the tired sounds from the community of the university. They say, ""The homeworks are too much, so I have waken up for day and night,"" ""I am tired since I cannot get good grade in spite of hard studying."" Absolute S/U can reduce the burden of students.

     To sum up, relative ABC is a devil who makes students suffer from studying. I think absolute S/U with the professor who interested in educating students is the solution of the university. I do not want to compete other students."	4.5	4.5	4	13
1422	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"      I think my university has a great system of education, welfare, etc. So I am very satisfied with my school life. However, there is some inconvenience in dormitory life. It's been a long time since the dormitories were built, but they haven't been remodeled. So, if I could change one important thing about my university, I would remodel the dormitories. I will explain two things that I felt uncomfortale using dormitory.

        First, the bathrooms in the unremodeled dormitories are uncomfortable. Since they are old building, the bathrooms are also not clean. Also, the structure of the bathroom and shower room is uncomfortable to use. For example, I have used the 'Sarang' dormitory twice. One time, I used it at Pre-URP before I entered KAIST, and it was not remodeled. At that time, I had a lot of inconvenience using the dormitory. Now, I live in the remodeled 'Sarang' dormitory. With the remodeling of 'Sarang' dormitory, the inconvenience of the past have been greatly improved. Therefore, I think dormitories that have not yet been remodeled should be remodeled as soon as possible for the convenience of students.

        Second, the dormitories are not soundproof. There are many students living in dormitories and their lifestyles will be different. Some students go to bed early and others stay up late. For example, when I lay down to sleep, I often heard other students talking or walking around so well that it was hard to fall asleep. The dormitory that I am using now has been remodeled, but I don't think the soundproofing problem has been solved. So, I hope that the ongoing remodeling of the dormitories will solve this problem.

        I heard that there are many dormitories that have not been remodeled yet. There are inconvenience such as toilets and soundproofing problems in using unremodeled dormitories. So, if I could change one important thing about my university, I would remodel the dormitories for the convenience of students."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
1423	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   KAIST students spend most of time to studying. We wake up at 8:00 am, and we usually listen to class for 6 hours each day. After class, we have to do a lot of homework. This kind of life causes great stress for students. So, I  insist that we need to reduce amount of assignments given to students for two reasons. 

First of all, It makes difficult for students to do other thing except studying. We have a duty to study, but other activities other than studying are also of great help to us. For example, Some KAIST students start to sell ‘Bungeoppang’ because they want to get new experiences. As in this case, college students need ti di a variety of things that coudn’t do in their school years other than study. In addition, instead of homework, if we do large scale club activity or exchange activities with other universitys, it will be an activity that can only be felt by universities.

The second reason that  assignments given to students cause big stress for students. KAIST students are among considerably smart while they are hig school students. Therefore, They are not only smart, but also they are full of confidence. But, many assignments and other academic pressures make students tired, and some students are forced to get poor grades even though they have worked hard. I think this system has side effects that undermine some student’s confidence.

To sum up, If KAIST reduces amount of assignments given to students, students get various experience such as start-up activity, large scale club activity and exchange activities with other universitys. Moreover, It can reduce the stress students get. In conclusion, I hope that KAIST will reduce the assignments given to students , so we can engage in more diverse activities and have a leisurely life."	4.5	4.5	4	13
1424	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"          KAIST is one of the best university in Korea. There are so many wonderful things, clever students and nice professors. Most student in Korea think KAIST is perpect university and they have no problem. But, I think there are several problems(or disadvantages) in KAIST. I think the most problem in KAIST is 'Essential subject' such as 'General Biology', 'General Physics 1' and 'General Chemistry'. So, if I could change only one thing about my university, I would remove 'Essentail subjects' for these two reaseons.

          First, many student don't have to know about some subject which is in 'Essentail subjects'. For example, students whose major is Physics don't have to know general biology because they never use biological knowledge in Physics. Forcing to participate all of the 'Essentail subjects' can make student tired. Even if, they might lose interest about thier major. According to a statistics(survey) which is made by 'Isang', KAIST Freshman student government, most KAIST student hate this system because they think it makes them tired and wastes their time to study thier major subject. Since they never use the knowledge in 'Essential subjects', they think it wastes their time.

          Second, it makes hard to graduate KAIST. Since we must complete all of the essential subjects to graduate KAIST, some student can't graduate even they satisfied all of the graduate condition except 'Essential subjects'. It is a very huge problem. Some student says ""I complete all of the condition to graduate, but I can't graduate in this semester because I can't participate 'Calculus 2' in this semester"". KAIST give more opportunity to particitate 'Essential subject' lectures to freshman students. So, It is hard to participate the lecture class for 4th grade students who want to graduate. Since KAIST have so many essential subjects, this problem is very huge problem.

          To summarize, essential subject system wastes students time to study their major subjects, and makes more hard to graduate, I think this system must be change. To decrease essential subjects or remove this system, we can solve this problem. So, for these reasons, if I can change only one thing in KAIST, I will fix this system. It makes student more easy to study their major and graduate."	4.5	4	3.5	12
1425	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In KAIST, majority of students may have some experiences that they order some food for there lunch or dinner by delivery. Because of the policy of KAIST, the delivery motorcycles cannot come in to our campus. Only delivery cars can come in to our campus and can deliver directly to our dormitory. This policy is hard to understand why school maintains this old policy. I would like to change this policy for us. There are 3 reasons why we can change this policy.

  First of all, because of this policy, it is hard to eat many kind of foods easily. Almost all of restaurants do not use car for their delivery. Thus if we order that foods, we have to walk about 15 minutes to main enterance or small enterance to take the ordered foods. This reduces the positive point of deliver. Many student us delivery because it is convinience. Thus they avoid these restaurants and find the another stores which support deliver to domitary. This limits the number of stores that we can order foods. According to our student association, 80% of students of KAIST cannot understand this policy and they think this policy should be deleted. For welfare for KAIST students, this policy should be changed.

  Second, the delivery bike is not that dangerous. School decides to maintain this policy because delivery bike is very dangeous to students. But the bike is not that much dangerous. One of my friend Junhyuk who has own bike said, ""bike is not that dangerous as much as school thinks."" He continued, ""All bike drivers reduce their speed in campus because there are a lot of students and speed bumps in campus. I can't understand school policy."" Also, in fact, there were no accidents in 2 years by the motorcycle in KAIST campus. Thus deleteing this school policy does not make problem as delivery bikes are not very dangerous. 

  Finally, the reason that school said does not support their decision. school said that they decide to maintain this policy because this is tradition of KAIST and It is hard to control the delivery bike as our campus is too big. This policy cannot be the tradition of the university. This policy violates students right which is the freedom of decision. Something that violates the student right cannot be the tradition. Also, the delivery bikes can be controled. The Seoul National University has bigger campus than KAIST. However, they are controlling the delivery bikes and they have no accident by them. Therefore, we can know that we also can control the delivery bikes. Two supports of school doesn't have the logic. Thus we don't have any reason to maintain this bad policy. 

  Because of the policy that the delivery bikes cannot get in to the campus, students can order to only few stores for their convenience. Also the delivery bikes are not that dangerous. Furthurmore, the evidences of schools to prevent delivery bikes do not have any logics. In conclusion, we have to change this policy for many people. "	4.5	4.5	4	13
1426	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     In Kaist, there are some special systems. I think the most special system is that all students enter the university with department of freshmen. Students can select a major afthe the first grade. But, sometimes it can be bad. I would like to change it. Students can choose a major whenever they want. I will explain 3 reasons.

     First of all, there are AP courses in KAIST. Most of students from science high school or science academy for the gifted have some AP courses. They can skip some subjects in basic subjects like Calculus, General Physics, and General Biology. So, some students have too little subjects to take in first year. For me, I got 4 AP courses in 9 basic subjects. Therefore, I just have 5 subjects to take in a year. It makes me to take 3 curtural subjects in firt grade. Fot these students, KAIST has to change this system.

     Second, there are many students that already decided a major. My best friend really likes computer science, so he studied computer science a lot since high school. He was the second place in computer science subjects of my high school, and he really hates biology. I also hate it. But, in KAIST, we have to take General Biology in first semester. Therefore, we nearly did not study, and get bad grades. I think it is too bad. Students have to take uninterested subjects though they already choose a major in theit mind.

    Finally, this system makes hard to graduate in 4 years in KAIST. To take many major subjects, 3 years are too little. Actually, over half of students graduate in 9 semester or 10 semster. I think, choosing a major in second grade makes hard to graduate. If students take major classes since first grade, they can graduate in 4 years. For me, I will be able to take a major class instead of General Biology! I think it is more better.

    To sum up, many students got some AP courses, and already decided a major. Choosing a major after the first grade is a disadvantage for them. They have to take uninterested subject, cannot take many major subjects in first grade. Also, it is hard to graduate in 4 years because of it. If students could a major whenever they want, these problems will be solve."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
1427	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     If you belong to university or some organization, you may have something dissatisfied that you want to change. In my case, I belong to KAIST, and I want to talk about what I am eager to change at KAIST. It about dormitory facility. At KAIST, most of students stay at dormitory. Thus, a dormitory affect large influence for student feeling comfortable in their daily life. Accordingly, if I could change one important thing about KAIST, I want to change dormitory facility for two reasons. 

     First, there are many dormitories which are very old. The buildings that now used for dormitory for KAIST students have been before KAIST is established. So the buildings are so old. In my case, when I staying a dormitory ""Areumgwan"", I show that the wall go moldy. And whenever it rains a lot, water or rain is soak through a wall. It makes uncomfortable to stay that room. Although the workers came, but they didn't find what the reaosn is. It make me tired and feel uncomfortable. In addition, there are a lot of bugs like ants and spiders. They make the students who stay at dormitory feel unpleasant.

     Secondly, the machine like banding machine and drying machine is old, too. Many of students are staying in dormitory for a long time especially nowadays because of COVID-19 situation. Therefore, I think the facility of machine in dormitory must be reformed. Now, the banding machine and drying machine was very old and we don't use card for using them. It is so uncomfortable.

    For these two reasons that the age of dormitory and facility of machine in dormitory is old, I claim that the dormitory facility must be reformed.

1428	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" The university has a certain timetable for lectures. For example, in the case of KAIST, 1 hour and 15 minutes of lecture for one class period, and has a 15-minutes break between class. In addition, all these timetable cycles begin at 9 a.m. Of course, depending on how students sign up for classes, the total number of classes students take on each day, ans the first class times varies from person to person. However, students can't escape the big frame and only within the timetable system. I would like to change this timetable cycle for the following reason.

 The first reason is that the time to start first period class is too fast. As mentioned before, KAIST's first class starts at 9 a.m. By the way, KAIST students lack sleep time and sometimes stay up all night due to lot of sudy and research activities. So, students are very tired and reluctant to go to class until 9 a.m. on next day. This phenomonon can be easily seen even during the signing up class period. Even in the same professor's class, class that start at different times are much more popular and reach the quota faster than classes that start at 9 a.m. Therefore, I'll postpone the entire timetable system for an hour and change it to start at 10 a.m. 

 The second reason is 75 minutes is a long time for students ans professors to stay focused only on their lectures. According to some neurooscopic studies, the human brain can not concentrate more than 50 minutes on one thing. Therefore, I would like to decrease lecture time per class. but i have never felt that the entire class for whole week is too long. So, considering that we are taking 150 minutes per week based on 3-credit course, I'll change to 3 classes for 50 minutes each. After that, students' concentration during lecture and their grades will also increase.

 To sum up, I want to increase KAIST students' sleeping time and concentration during lecture. Because of these 2 reasons, I want to change timetable system of KAIST. Specifically, postpone the entire timetable system for an hour and make 50 minutes lecture for one class period."	4.5	4	4.5	13
1429	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   All students at KAIST are required to take basic courses like CS101, CH101 etc. Many of students can see that the number of credits of each course and the class time per week do not match. For example, MAS102(Calculus II) has 3 credits, but the actual class time is 6 hours per week. That is why many students have to spent more time to take classes than they have applied for. So if I change one important thing about KAIST, I will change the number of credits of each class to match weekly class hours. 

  Why should the credits of the course be matched with the weekly class hours? According to the KAIST portal, KAIST students have to have a minimum of 12 credits per a semester. It is a small number compared to other universities. But in fact, KAIST students have to spend 20 or more hours a semester listening to 'classes' instead of 12 hours per week. They need to review about what they learned it separately and they need time to discuss it with their friends, but they don't have enough time. Therefore, I prepared two alternatives. 

  First, change the recitation class to free attendance. In fact, it does not help much when students who don't need help to take a recitation class. If recitation is mandatory, the number of students participating in the recitation class, some students who really need help will find it difficult to get help. Therefore, students in need of help can get help from their teaching assistants and the rest can study other things they needed. 

  Secondly, increase the number of credits in courses with experimental courses or with practice classes. They really have a lot of lab time, class time compared to the number of credits. For example, a general chemical experiment is worth one credit, but it actually takes about four hours to do the experiment. Raising their credits will reduce their absurdity. 

In conclusion, students feel a lot of separation because they are taking so many classes compared to the grades they applied for. Therefore, changing the practice class to free attendance and increasing the credits of the coures of the experiment will solve the problem. "	4.5	4	3.5	12
1430	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   The freshmen of KAIST expect the best campus life. Obiously, professors and classmates are among the best in the world. However, there is a flaw in KAIST's cmapus life. That is the dormitory communal toilets and shower booths. The problem has two negative aspect, so I choose this what i want to change.

   First, it has privacy problem. Though there are screens in the shower rooms, but there is no screen in changing room. So, freshmen are forced to show thier naked bodies to other people. Most people might feel ashamed of this situation. Especially, someone withe physical complex will be reluctatnt to take a shower.

   Second. the common toilets and shower booths have quarantine problems. Since Corona 19, quarantine has become very important. However, many people share a few toilet in common toilet, which can lead to hygiene problems. If one of the dormitory members gets infected withe Corona 19, it will be easy to become a mass infection through the bathroom.

   In conclussion, the toilet and shower booth have problems with collective hygiene as well as individual rights. To solve these, each room have to have a toilet. If that happens, satifaction of students with school life will increase."	4.5	4	4	12.5
1431	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    What do you think the necessary points which people can be lived? Generally, people say the clothes to wear, the places to live, and the foods to eat. Besides three things, people need various things to live as human. In my university, KAIST, most of things consist well enough to satisfy people, but I think there are some deficient things in eating. Therefore, I would introduce why KAIST could change the policies related to eating.

     The first problem is the number of kinds of the food. As you look around KAIST, there are few restaurants like Kaimaru, Lotteria, Subway. Although Kaimaru has four types of restaurants, their menu are limited and the students who lived for a year feel that the food is always repeated.

     The second problem is the open time of restaurants. KAIST students used to late at lunch or dinner by their study or research. Then most of restaurants in KAIST closed in that time and the students should eat their meal in outdoors.

     In conclusion, the eating in KAIST has the problems in types of food and time. I think it could be solved by increasing the number of restaurants, and I hope these problem solve as soon as possible."	3.5	3.5	4	11
1432	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change one thing about KAIST, I would change the location of KAIST to Seoul. There are several reasons that KAIST should move to Seoul.

       First, It is hard to communicate with other university in Deajeon. Most of interesting university to KAIST student is located in Seoul, such as Seoul National University, Korea National University, Yeonse Universtiy. But It takes two hours to go to Seoul. Also, There is no interesting place in Deajeon to pull out students from the university. 

       Secondly, It is hard to participate in social movement or event. Experience many thing is important. However, most events held in Seoul. Distance between Deajeon and Seoul is too far to participate in events during semester. 

       Finally, It is hard to learn other things. In university, student have some time to do non-study-related things. But absoulte number of academies is lower than Seoul. Also, there are not enough people who have same interestings. Another reason is that transportation is so complecate in Deajeon. It makes student to hesitate to go out of the KAIST. 

       Non-study-related activities are helpful for creative thinkings. Creative thinkings are very important to do good researches or studies. Therefore non-study-related activities are actually related to study. If KAIST changes location to Seoul, students can get more opportunity to do such things. I suggest that KAIST should move to Seoul.  "	3.5	4	3.5	11
1433	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    University students encounter many problems and stress. The best thing that make most students relax and enjoy is food. However, students also have problems during their meals. Have you ever experienced a crowd of people during lunch time in school or university? Have you ever been upset with that situation? I am the one who had encountered this problem since primary school until university. Therefore, if I could change one crucial thing about my university, I would like to make a change in cafeteria with these three aspects.

     First of all, an increase in cafeteria’s capacity is important. During lunch time, crowded students need to have lunch at the same time, so the quantity and size of the cafeterias are not enough for a large number of students. I think if the university could build a new cafeteria at the place near the East cafeteria, students would be more comfortable for their lunch.

     Furthermore, the food selling time is fixed, so the students who finish the class early connot get their food before the selling time. They have to wait until that time. This also brings about crowded people in the cafeteria. If those students who finish the class early could have their lunch before other students, there would be less crowd during lunch time in the cafeteria, and they would not have to waste their time waiting for the selling period. Hence, the food selling period should be more flexible.

     Finally, I would like to add a new rule for using cafeteria during lunch time. Sometimes, students who had already finished their lunch do not give their seats to other students who haven’t had their meals yet. Those students continue to talk to their friends after finishing their lunch, so other students do not have a seat. This behavior should be prohibited during rush hour such as lunch time, and the rule should be set.

     In conclusion, the problems about the university cafeteria should be solved. If I could make some changes in my university cafeteria, I would like to change in its capacity, and make the food selling time more flexible. Moreover, the rule for using cafeteria should be set for students to give their seats to other students who haven’t had their meals. I think if the university cafeteria could be changed in these ways, students would feel better about their lunch and have more time left to do other activities during their break time."	5	4.5	4.5	14
1434	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    KAIST, one of the best universities in Korea, has a special way of teaching. Some people who aren't KAIST's students might think about the contents of classes, or spend 1 year with no major. However, many KAIST students will think that the most biggest difference between KAIST and other universities is the language of classes. Some students may think that studying with English class is better than with Korean, and other students may think it is too hard to study since they are not good at English. So, I think it will be much better to choose classes' langauge, between Korean an English, for some basic subjects for two reasons below.

     First of all, it will helpful for freshman to adapt to KAIST. All of KAIST students should learn basic subjects to graduate KAIST, and most of freshmans listen those basic subjects in their first 1 year. At that time, as quite many students suffer from English class, they might lose their will to study. However, if they can choose classes' languages, some students who cannot speak, write, or listen English well can study other subjects such as math, science, or programming without difficulties, and they can also have time, about 1 year, to improve their English to study with English. This way, it will be easy for them to adapt to KAIST's English class when they become second grade. Also, other students who are confident in English, or students from other countries can listen English classes and they can adapt one year early than other students who listens classes with Korean.

     Second, It can make students concentrate on classes. Some students do not listen professors' class carefully for some reasons, such as ""I can't understand the class because I can't do English well, so I should read textbook myself for long time after class,"" or ""Professor has bad pronunciation, so I just study with textbook."" Those students usually study with textbooks, not with professors. With short-sight, it might be helpful to study. However, with long-sight, it will harmful for study because they should listen professors' classes since the contents of classes become much hard as they become second, or third grade. So making a habit for studying with professors is important, and choosing language can make that habit to freshman. Freshman can study without difficulties of English or pronunciation, and they can concentrate on the professors' classes.

     In summary, if we make system so that students can choose languages for basic subjects, many freshmans can adapt to KAIST's English class systems easily, and they can make a habit for studying with professors, not just with textbooks. In this way, they can study with interest, and they can graduate KAIST successfully. "	4.5	4	4	12.5
1435	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  People in my university usually take a class in English. This is a characterisitic of our school. Except for some professors, most professors use English, a universal language, for some foreign students is classes. In the case of English classses to improve listening, reading, and writing skills in English, it is more appropriate to teach in English. But, Is it really helpful to students using English in all class? My opinion is that it seems inconvenient to teach classes in English and communicate with students without any clear intention. So I want to change using only English in class. 

       First, except for students who are very good at English, students have problems with communication. English is very different from Korean, so the intention of interpreting it in English and translating it into Korean may be different. Also, if we don’t listen carefully to the professor’s announcements properly, it is difficult to understand their intention. Like this, as we proceed with all the courses in English, we have more communication problems and study problems than we thought. 

       Second, the goal of improving student’s English skills at the same time by conducting classes in English is changing. Students try to find an easy and simple translation books to understand their hard and difficult major books written in English. Also, students tent to avoid problems which they are faced while carrying out tasks that should be carried out in English. they can use a translator for convenience, although they have to improve their thinking skills. Like this, students want to pursue convenience rather than improve their English skills.

      In conclusion, by using English in the all of the classes, there are many problem which students may face. Stuents can have communication problems and studing problem which can cause because of an incomprehensible major term. Also, the goal of getting students to study English is turning into a bad point. However, if we do not use English, additional measures such as posting additional notices in English will be necessary for foreign students because English is their own language. Through these methods, we need to change the way our school teaches English unconditionally. "	4	4	4.5	12.5
1436	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    Kaist is the one of the vest universities in Korea. There are a lot of good things such as giving one year to choose students' major. However, I think if Kaist has more major, it would be better. There are 3 reasons.

    First, students can improve their sight. In Kaist, there are only students who study and interest science and math. Thus, students can think only one way that in science and math. However, if Kaist have more major, there are a lot of students who think different and interest music, exercise and so on. Then, students live and study together, they can share their think and sight. Doing this, they can improve sight and think more way. It will be very helpful after graduation.

    Second, students can learn various study. Now, Kaist students are able to study about language, music and so on at only culture class. The number of Culture class is very little. Thus, they can not study everything that they want to study. On the other hand, if Kaist have more major, university must make more class about the new major, Then, the number of class will be increase and student can learn various study. And also, the quality of class will be better.

    Finally, the quality of culture can be increased. Kaist students enjoy cultural life while studying. However, there are not some of students whose major is music or exercise, students are able to study and practice himself or herself. Or, they have to hire a teacher to learn more. On the other hand, if there are some friends who study music or exercise, they can teach and advise to improve their quality. It will be more better.

    In conclusion, if Kaist has more major, Kaist students can improve their sight, learn various study, and improve the quality of culture. Thus, if I could change one important thing about your university, I will make more major."	4.5	4	3.5	12
1437	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Someone could say that ""the old one is the good one"". However, things are changing rapidly these days, and organizations should also change their properties to survive. KAIST, one of the  leading university in Korea, has changed many things throughout its wonderful 50 years. Those changes brought many positive effects and advantages to KAIST, which made the university as the leading university of country. However, I think there is one thing that is unchanged throughout many years. If I could change one important thing about my university, I definitely reduce the burden of essential basic subjects for three reasons.

 First of all, they have huge loads even though they are easy and familiar to many students. For example, calculus, the most important subject in college life, is teached to many students of KAIST in highschool. That means most of them are familiar with calculus, and they just need to spent short times routinely to justify the knowledge while they take courses. However, calculus class requires at least 10 hours per week mandatory, and it feels like some of the lectures are repeating useless knowledges. All the other basic subjects has the same manner of loads, so I think it should be reduced.

 Second, It hinders the opportunity for taking major lectures early. To taking all the basic lectures in freshman year, taking the major subjects is physically blocked. Of course, the university's official recommendation semester to take major lectures is from 3rd semester, right after entering department of the students. However, it is obvious that taking some major lectures in freshman would help the students for better decision in entering departments. In summary, basic lectures hinders students to take major lectures early, so it should be changed.

 Lastly, many freshmans are really suffering from this. one of my friends said, ""I dont want to study biology because I decided my mind to study mathmatics"". In fact, general biology has huge amount of things to study, and it can hurt some students who don't interested in that field. University says that intersidciplinary is becoming more and more important, so we should learn the basic of all subjects to become a good scientists. However, I think the students have their rights to taking the subjects they want, as they are not child anymore. Therefore, I think basic subjects should not be mandatory.

 In conclusion, If I get a chance, I will reduce heavy burden of essential basic subjects because of its huge load, give opportunity for taking major lectures, and to rescue many freshmans from that burden. Of course, essential basic lectures are literaly ""essential"", and It should be familiar for all university students in KAIST. However, the more important property that university should keep is the students. Therefore, they should change the courses of essential basic lectures, to save the suffering students from pain."	4.5	4.5	4	13
1438	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Students who graduated from high school enter universtiy with great expectations. I also have many great expectations too. In universy, students can take high-quality lectures which contain their interests and make many friends by doing club activities. There are a lof of good things about university activities. To take a lecture at university, students have to register for a course. Each class a fixed number of students and I want to change this. There are two reasons that university would like to change no limit on the number of participants in the major lecture.

First, this method can give positive effects on students future. Students can improve their ability to listen lecture which they want to hear. If the class is full so students can't take the lecture, then he or she have problem on planning his or her future timetable. For example, on last semester, some student who are in KAIST department computer department, can't take their major lecture because so many students want to that lecture. Therefore, it is necessary to remove restriction of limiting the number of participants.

Second, students don't have to be stressed about enrolling the class. In university, student have to register for a course to take a course. Many people visit the sever to register for classes eventually the server breaks down. Because of this, some students cannot take the course they want, and the student got stress a lot. If university change no limit on the number of participants in the major lecture, this will not happen.

In conculsion, If restriction on the number of limiting course participant is removed, students will got positive respond. It is because student can easily make their own future timetable, and do not have to got stress from course enrolling time. Of course, there are a lot of problem in this method. For example, students concentration problem on some subject, and lack of professor problem. I think a good enough solution will come out after fix some problems."	4	4.5	4	12.5
1439	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"It's been almost 1 year from my first class at KAIST. I felt so many times that KAIST is a wonderful university during this year, but there is one thing which I want to be changed.

KAIST is pretty boring place for students. There are two reasons about why KAIST is boring, and one reason about why it have to be changed.

First of all, location of KAIST is at very boring town. There are few places that we can play near KAIST.

Two years ago, when I was at high school, I've already been to KAIST due to mathematical camp. During break time, me and my friends try to find some places to play, and we have to cross the river, using 30 minutes for walking. According to my senior, there is only one town that are directly adjacent to KAIST that we are able to play at. Even though, it is very small. Also, there are no famous landmarks near KAIST.

Secondly, WI-FI at dormitory are not good enough for playing. Sometimes it is not enough for Zoom meeting, so it's trivial that WI-FI is slow for online gaming or watching youtube.

Third, studing is not all of university life. KAIST is best place for studing science, but sometimes university students need rest, playing games, sing their favorite songs, or love each other. I believe that happy campus life will make a lot of energy for studing.

For summary, I think KAIST is boring because there are very few amount of places to play near KAIST, also dormitiory WI-FI is slow for gaming. And It have to be changed because taking enough rest and playing will provide good condition for studing. It is impossible to move the location of KAIST, so I wonder there will be more lankmarks to play near KAIST!"	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
1440	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Unlike other universities, our university, KAIST, has many unique systems and cultures like strawberry festival, scholarship system, etc. Most of these systems are really good and helpful for students, but several systems make students hard. And I think the most important thing that need to be changed is that most of lectures are held in English. I think this policy is not good with two reasons.

 First, it makes the level of lecture low. Most of professors in KAIST is Korean and English is not their native language. However they need to prepare and teach their lecture with English, so it is not easy for professors. Also, if there exists any issue about grammar or word usage, it makes students to understand their lecture hard.

 Second, it makes students hard to understand the lecture. Although there are many foreigner students in KAIST, but most of students in KAIST is Korean. So if we hear English lecture, it need to be translated in Korean once. This process takes a lot of time, so it makes easy students to lost their lecture, and makes understand their major hard. Also, it makes easy for student to understand in wrong way, and realize this and fix it is hard. For example, I have heard linear algebra twice. The first was english lecture and it was hard to understand. But second time is Korean lecture, and it is easy to understand the lecture.

 Of course, there are many objections like, 'It will make foreigner students hard.' or 'Because most of researches and papers are written in English, it is neccesary for students.' But I think the most important thing in lecture is to make students understand about what they are teaching. So I think English lectures in KAIST should be changed is another ways like pre-recorded lecture or separate Korean and foreigner students because it makes lectures' level low and also makes hard to understand lectures."	4	4.5	3.5	12
1441	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   There are many discussions at student union to improve the student's life in my university. For example, there are many opinions about using mobile student ID card because it is useful 

and other universities already use. So last night, KAIST execute the mobile ID card for students. It has some problems to use, but soon it will be fix. Like this, changes in my school make 

positive effects for students. But, some places or programms are unconvinence. If I could change one important thing about my university, I want to increase a number of enrolment in my 

university for these two reasons.

     First of all, many students are worried about enrolement every year. It is fact that not all students can participate in the class that they want. Since, students can determine their

 department freely in my university, there are many problems for enrolement every year. For example, there were many writing about enrolment about school of computing at Everytime 

community. According to the Everytime, the opinion was that 'I determine department freely. But why can't I listen the lecture?'.  I think this is very big problem.

     Second, the number of humanity class and exercising class are small. Because KAIST is not similar with other universities, humanity classes and exercising classes are too small to 

comparisioin with math and science classes. In past, it is okay for scientists to do only science. But these days, many other properties are required for scientists. Due to small humanity and 

exercising classes, not many students can participate in various lecture. Because the purpose of KAIST is making good scientists, university have to improve the enrolment of these classes.

     To sum up, I want to increase a number of enrolment in my university because many students are worried every year, and the number of humanity and exercising class are small. I know 

that it is not easy to increase a nuber of enrolement for short time. But it is fact that this problem is serious for students. Why don't the university discuss this problem with student union,

and make great decision?"	3.5	3	3	9.5
1442	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST is good university in Korea. I am proud of KAIST student. KAIST has many advantages to study and live, but there are disadvantages of KAIST, too. I think location is one of disadvantages of KAIST. I love Daejeon but Daejeon is smaller city than Seoul. So I want to change location of KAIST with 3 reasons.

  First of all, Daejeon is city which less people live than Seoul. Also Daejeon is big city objectively in Korea. It is in 6 biggest city in Korea. But compare with Seoul, less people live in Daejeon. If KAIST in Seoul, more people can go to university more easier. Because in KAIST, many people are from Seoul. So if KAIST is in Seoul, they are more easily go to school and home. Also, there are more applicant to freshman when we change location. Many students worry about KAIST is not Seoul. Because they are worry about live in different places. 

  Second, you can easily move to other countries. Seoul is capital of Korea. It means many transportations are located in Seoul. There are more many subways in Seoul than Daejeon. You can go easily anywhere. And there are airport and KTX lanes near Seoul. If you want to go Busan, you spend only 1hours by using an airport. These are make other advantages too. For instance, you can plan outdoor activities with your friends more easily. Not only outdoor activities, But also you can plan many entertainments in Seoul.

  Third, Seoul has more entertainments that you can join. Daejeon's nickname is 'not funny city'. I also know it is just rumor and joke, but many people are agreed about there are only few entertainments in Daejeon. On the other hand, Seoul has many places that you enjoy. For examples, there are 2 theme parks in Seoul. You can go Seoul Land or Lotte World. These are in Seoul so you need to go only one hour. And there are various cafes in Seoul. They are different theme in cafes, such as rakon cafe, cat cafe, cafe with look like 80's korea. These days, young people like to join Instagram with many spaces. If KAIST is in Seoul, more students join Instagram and communicate with others easily. 

  To sum-up, I want to change location of KAIST from Daejoen to Seoul. There are 3reasons why I want to change. Seoul has more people, more transportations, more entertainments than Daejeon. Many highschool students consider location of universities when they choose university. If KAIST can move to Seoul, there are more applicants to go KAIST. And going to Seoul can be biggest welfare to students and professors. I hope KAIST is Seoul, so I can go university from my home."	5	4.5	4	13.5
1443	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Have you ever experienced an car accident? In KAIST, we can see losts of cars including motocycles and electric kickborads. However, we can also see people who don't obey the safety rules such as wearing a helmet, not going on the sidewalk and so on. So, I'd like to dicuss one important thing that I hope to change about KAIST. What I'd like to change is about the traffic culture. I want to chage the way people use their car into more safe way by the following two reasons.

 First, the traffic culture is strongly related to our safety and health. According to the statistics, 10 or more car accidents happens every month at KAIST because people don't follow the safety rules. These accidents threaten our safety and health. However, we can easily prevent car accidents by changing our traffic culture. We can keep our safety and health by obeying the safety rules. That's why we need to change the traffic culture into better way.

 Second, the way people use their car reflects our citizenship. When guests come to KAIST, the easiest thing to accedd is cars. So, our citizenship will be shown to them according to how we use thr cars.

 To sum up, I want to make the traffic culture which means the way people use their car more safe. Because the traffic safety guarantees our safety and it reflects our citizenship. In addition, we need to obey the rules of the traffic safety in order to make the traffic culture better. For instance, we need to wear a helmet when we ride a motocycle or electric kickborad. And we should follow the traffic signal. Let's change the traffic culture better with these practices."	4	4.5	4	12.5
1444	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"My university, KAIST, is one of the most famous university in Korea. There are many advantages in my school, but there are also some disadvantages. In this paragraph, I'll talk about the one important thing that I want to change about my university. There are many cafeterias in my school, and I have been to all of the cafeterias. But, similarly, all of the cafeterias are not clean!. Cooking rooms are messy, and cooking tools are dirty. The hygienic condition of the cafeterias are too bad. So I want to change my university cafeterias' hygienic condition. There are two reasons why I want to change it.

First, everywhere, it is important to keep cleaning state, and it is more important to keep cleaning conditions at cafeterias. Because, we have to eat foods from there. It is related with what we eat, and our health, so it is important to keep clean. In my case, about a month ago, I went to the, KAIMARU, which is the representative cafeteria in my university. I was so hungry, and I ordered my favorite menu. I was looking forward to eat that menu, however, while I was eating it, I found the rubber band in it. If I eat that rubber band it'll be the problem about my health.

Next, I am very sensitive about the cleaning problem, so I want to change the hygienic condition first. My parents are very clean when I was young, so I was influeced by them. My house and the things in my house are very clean, so when I see somthing dirty or messy, I can't stand it. Because of it, I become very sensitive about cleaning, so I want to change all of the things in cafeterias.

To sum up, the eating problem is very important to people, and I am sesitive about the cleaning problem, but basically, it is too dirty and messy, so I want to change the hygienic conditions about my university cafeterias."	3.5	4.5	4	12
1445	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Students spend a lot of time in their university. They usually use school facilities such as library, restaurant, and dormitory. Among them, they spend the most time in dormitory. They sleep, take a shower, and do their homework. Therefore, dormitory is one of the most important spaces. If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I would change our dormitory because of three reasons. 

  First, our dormitory is little bit uncomfortable to wash. Most dormitory in KAIST, room and bathroom locate separately. We have to go out to wash. Some rooms are far from the bathroom, so it would be inconvenience. 

  Second reason is low recycling percentage. Our dormitory have trashcans separated to general trash, plastic, can, and paper. They have no vinyl. That's why all the vinyl is thrown away as general trash. The amout of vinyl trash is very large. If we don't make vinyl trashcan, our recycling efficiency is going to be very low. 

  Finally, students can't control heating system. Dormitory heating system is managed centerally. Students can't make temperature differently. Because of this system, some students are hot, and others are cold. 

  In conclusion, KAIST dormitory is good enough. However, I would change dormitory If I could change one important thing about KAIST because of location of the bathroom, recycling, and heating system. There are not many students in the dormitory theses days. I hope we can see in KAIST soon."	4	4.5	3.5	12
1446	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In MIT, there is one corridor. Every time you go through the corridor, you can see the research of other departments.

But in KAIST, there are all made up of independent buildings.

If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I would change building structure in KAIST to connected structure.

    First, it is not easy to see what other researchers in other fields do in KAIST. However connected building structure creates contacts between researchers in other fields.  In fact, MIT's connected building structure has had a big impact on their creative research.

    Second, connected building structure makes us easy to move between classrooms. It is hard to move outside when it rains, is cold, or is hot. Movements are not a simple problem at ther large KAIST. A connected building structure give us free movement under any circumstances.

    In conclusion, connected building structure creates contacts between reseachers in other fields and makes us easy to move between classrooms, So If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I would change building structure in KAIST to connected structure."	4	4	4	12
1447	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST is one of the best university in Korea. It has good science instruments, good professors and good students. In my opinion, everything in KAIST is perfect. However, I think it would be better to change the location from Daejeon to Seoul. Some Kaistians will not agree to my thought because they are now comfortable with the KAIST in Daejeon. I will explain several reasons of changing location from Daejeon to Seoul.

  First, we can have more opportunities to get a job. Many cooperations and companies are located in Seoul. This means that students will likely to interact often with companies. For example, student can experience job fairs, company tour with ease. Also when we do job interview in the company's building which is located in Seoul, students who are not familiar with the region will not feel comfortable. 

  Second reason is that we can cooperate with other universities easily. Most major universities such as Seoul National University and Korea University are located in Seoul. We can cooperate with them through the online. But, it is more powerful to meet face to face. I heard that labs in KAIST are doing co-research with many universities. If the location is changed, process of research will be much more effective.

  Finally, more students will eager to enter the KAIST. Every students knows that KAIST is best university. However, some high school students do not prefer to enter the KAIST. I think the biggest reason is that KAIST located in Daejeon. High school students would prefer Seoul. When I was high school students, most of students wanted to go universities in Seoul. One reason is that good universities are  located in Seoul. The other reason is that there are many facilites they can enjoy ,and they can meet many other university students easily. If many students want to enter KAIST, it is good for KAIST. This is because many smart students will enter the KAIST.

  In conclusion, I would like to change the location of KAIST from Daejeon to Seoul. We can have more chance to get a job. We can coopoerate with other universities easily. More students will want to enter KAIST."	5	4.5	4	13.5

1449	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I sometimes imagine that I could change something in my university. I know it&#39;s hard to change the
university, but it will be very nice if I could change something! What would you change if you could
change one important thing about your university? In my case, if I could change one important thing
about my university, I would remove the test. There are two reasons for my opinion.

First, students can study freely if the tests are removed. There are many things to do, and many
students study by force in lack time. If the test is removed, students can study more flexible and they
can get more information from increased study time. I thought that the test make students to study
before, but when I became a college student, I changed my mind. Students have to study freely. Of
course, we can check our knowledge by the test. However, without the test, we can check our
knowledge by discussing with other students.

Second, many students get stressed about the test. In my case, I got much stress before the test, so I
feel like my life is hard to live. However, when there was no test, I didn&#39;t feel stressful, and I was happy
to study. I think many students don&#39;t like to take the exam. Also, when there is no test, students will
have more time to relax, and they can develop their hobbies. Therefore, it will make their lives more
meaningful.

To sum up, students can study freely if the tests are removed and many students get stressed about
the test, so I would remove the test and increase discussing time with other students. Also, I think it will
be better if we can do some project in 1st grade in KAIST, and make something special. We can do that
later now, but I think change the test to project will be better. but, there is one thing the most
important. Students have to study hard although the tests are removed."	4.5	4.5	4	13
1450	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   Do you remember feeling nervous when you signed up for classes at the begining of the semester? The advantage of university is that we can find and take classes we want, but at the same time it can be a disadvantage. Because other people want to take the class that I want. Most of the classes have more hope than the garden, so some people can't take the classes. Our school selects through a lottery first, the remaining number of people will be selected on a first come, first served. And the cancellation period and application period are divided into night and day. I want to change to eliminate the day and night division of this second draw period and randomly choose the second draw. 

   First of all, burden of students is reduced. Everyone uses a variety of methods to get on a frist come, first served basis quickly. It is general to use a good computer in a PC room and sometimes use a macro program. Many people gather at once and server is often paralyzed, so you may not be able to use other services. If lottery every day, students will be able to enter the school hompage at their own convenience. Many people around me want this system, too.

   Secondly, it is easier to make a timetable. It is common to chage the timetable to take a class with friend or to see a professer you want. Because the current system is to cancle at night and apply during the day, if you want to change the timetable, you must cancel several classes at once and apply at once. It is almost impossible to change the timetable because it is difficult to win all the class draw. I saw my friends getting a lot of stress from this problem.

   For these reasons, I hope to freely apply and cancel, and draw classes for one day. Classes in our school are have high quality. Therefore, many students want to take class. But it is impossible for all students to take the classes they want at the time they want, and all students admit it. If the signed up for class system changes as I suggested, I think many Kaistian will be satisfied. I hope everyone can take the class they want next semester. "	4	4.5	4	12.5
1451	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     In Korea, Many university students have their major. KAIST students also have one major or several majors. Each department of KAIST has required major courses and optional major 

courses. The required major courses are those that students majoring in the department must take. On the other hands, optional major subjects that students choose and take in the subject 

of their desired major fields. KAIST students must take the required major courses set by each department to graduate. In my opinion, the required major subjects have disappeared and 

only optional major subjects have to be run because of two reasons.

           First of all, students' academic achievement can be improved. Until now, students had to take required major subjects even if they did not match their desired majors. For this 

reason, students had to study even the content of the part that they did not like. By allowing students to take only optional major subjects, students will be able to take more classes that 

they want and their academic achievement will increase. So, for students' academic achievement, only optional major subjects are necessary.  

           Besides, the second reason is that university is not same with high school. In Korea, high school students learn about same subjects and same contents. However, The university is not 

the high school. University students have to choose their major, and they have to choose their course. So, University have to make many major subjects. University students have to learn 

about the major subjects that they select for their future.

           In conclusion, Required major subjects should be eliminated and only optional major subjects should be operated. University students will study more because they select the 

major subjects by themselves. Also, Students want to learn about the optional major subjects that they choose for their dream and future. For these reasons, if I can change one of the 

university, I would like to remove the required major courses and change to operate only optional major courses."	4	4.5	4	12.5
1452	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST is great science university in Korea. The professors in KAIST leads scientific advance and teach their knowelege for students. Also, KAIST gives vasious present such as schoolarship.

So, it is helpful university to study science and progress for student. But, if I can change one important thing abour KAIST, I want to reduce elementary courses for two reasons.

First, some elementary courses is not helpful to some students. For example, general biology course needs a lot of time to study because student should remember many contents. But, some students who are not interested in biology feels boring. Also, They think time to biology is not helpful to them because they usually never study again biology after finishing this elementary course. Other example is some student who are cloesd to graduation and do not take some elementary courses. They alreay study their major hard, but they should take some elementary courses for graduation. They can feel time to study this courses is useless. 

Second, many elementary courses do not give time for exploration department for students. The fressman in KAIST can choice their department when they finish first grade. In other words, their first year is time to find their interesting and proper major. However, because students should take many elementary courses, they always do many homeworks and study for exam. Also, they can not taking courses in some department which they want to enter. 

To sum up, taking many elementary courses is sometimes useless for some students and give no time to explore department. Taking elementary courses have many advantages including giving various and elementary knowelge. However, for these reasons, I think the number of elementary courses should be reduced."	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5
1453	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Many students want to come to college and make their dreams come true. However, many students give up their goals because of excessive competition. So, I want to change the university grade system to SU. There are three reasons for this.

First, excessive competition can be prevented. The current evaluation system puts too much pressure on students and makes them focus solely on grade management. Because of this, students get a lot of stress and give up their dreams.

Second, you can prevent cheating that alters evaluation. The current method is not fair because each professor gives different grades. Therefore, there may be cheating by a professor or student trying to change grades. But changing grade system can help prevent cheating because your standards are fair.

Finally, we can evaluate factors other than the test. In the past, students who only do well on exams get good grades, but at SU, students are evaluated through collaboration, discussion, and assignments. Students will be able to think and do more creatively.

In conclusion, changing your grades to SU is better for achieving your students' dreams."	3.5	4.5	4.5	12.5

1512	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"   Compared to past, many people go other conturies for their study, trip, and other goals. This phenomenons have been increasing by developing the transportations connecting between conturies and decreasing cost about them. Although people have their own purposes, among them, why do they go to abroad for their study? Studys about their major can be carried in their own conturies with better conditions in case of South Korea, such as language and co-workers. However, I think there is two reasons for this: increasing perspectives and study carried with trip.
   First of all, people go to other conturies to study for increasing perspectives. We can think about easily that there is large gap between our and other contruries' culture. For example, in India, they eat meals by using their hands. In addition, in specific conturies, rising the thumbs wihch means to us 'Good Job!' can be considered as insulting. Therefore, these differences between the cultures make us to change our basic thoughts and this turning points change our life.
   As well as perspectives, there is an another reason, catching study and trip together. Though they go to other conturies to study, there is no law preventing us from going to trips. If they study with trips, including walking by lakes, visiting famous ruins, and even visiting houses of foreigners who are met in universities. they hang out with their foreign life better and this affects their study for good direction.
   To summarize, people go to abroad to study for several reasons. By experiencing other cultures, they broaden their perspectives and carry the study with trips. Thus, why do you go to abroad to study?"	3.5	4	3.5	11
1513	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"People choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. In Korea, more and more people choose it. Someone think it is not effective and helpful. However, it has a lot of reasons. I'll introduce some reasons of students choose it.

  First, it is the way to learn different language. If you study schools or universities outside your home countries, you don't study your home countries language. You must study school's or university's country lanuage. You use shcool's or university's country language when you study, so you can learn shcool's or university's country language. Also, you use school's or university's country language when you don't study. For example, If I go and study in U.S.A high school. I talk with my friend, however, in U,S,A, all my friend is not good at Korean. So, we talk in English. I use school's or university's country language normaly, so I will good at school's or university's country language. 
  
  Second, it can provide high level education for students.. There are many great schools and universities in the worlds, but these kind of schools and universities in some countries like U.S.A. There are big level diffirence in good schools, and bad shcools. These kind of schools and universities can provide better education, friends, and teacher. Education will be more harder useful, your friends will be more talent and work harder, your teacher will provide more harder in these kind of schools and universities. So, many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries because of this strength.

  Third, you can get diffirent edcuation situation. For example, U.S.A education is very slow, so students can do it easily. However, Korea education is very fast. There are these kind of difference in many countries. So, many students don't want to their countries education's situation, so they want to study in other countires shcools or universities. 



Conculsion : In short, Many people choose to study other countries shcools or universities, and there are some reasons. They want to learn different language, they want to learn with high level education, and they want to get diffirent edcuation situation. If you think these reasons looks good, why don't you choose to attend schools or universities outside your home countries?"	4	4	3.5	11.5
1514	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, many people, especially who are trying to be a researcher, study abroad. It even looks like a certain trend. Studying abroad brings a lot of advantages, but it also brings a lot of disadvanatages too. For example, new cultural environments and bacgrounds will give you new insight, but they will aslo take much energy from you. Not only mental stress, financial problems are important to. You could spend a lot of meney during the course. Then why do people study abroad? Most people deside to study abroad since studying abroad gives students new connections, gives high-quality educations, and wides students' insight. 

    The first reason why people study abroad it to make new connections with new people. If you ever tryed to get a job, you must felt that the name of your school of links with your calledge mates are very important. It is true that problems such as giving a priority to people who graduated universities considered as top class or having personal connections are one of social problems. However, the reality is the phenomenon exists. Also, their acts cannot be critisized firmly since they are using their social resources in a smart way. Therefore many people try to make good connections in an aspect of getting benefits. And the point is many high-quality universities are at overseas. So this is the first reason why people prefer to study abroad: To make new good connections to people.

    The second reason why many people go abroad to study is to get a high quality of education. I slightly mensioned about is in the previous paragraph. The point is that many universityes with smart students, enough financial supports, and passionate professors are at overseas. There are obvious examples such as MIT or Harverd universites. These differences in education makes a tremendous change to students' future. Passionate professors can provide students an opertunity of joining a nice research project. Also, students can improve themselves through competitions with other talented students. If you want a numerical evidence, take a look at the numbers of great scholars from those top class universities.
There are remarcable difference and it shows the effectness of the studying abroad well. 

    The final reason is because experiencing various cultures and studies wides students' insights who are studying abroad. This reason can be thought is two ways. The first reason is related to the studying itself. As you know, in each group of researchers or a lab, there is a slight difference between their philosiphy treating each field. Learning these differecnes can give lots of new insights to students. The next point is about the students' lifestyle. People who experienced varous cultures have much more possibility to ba a global leader. They can communicated with others well and inspire people with great ideas. This is an important personality for researchers, and studying aborad improves students in this point a lot. 

    So these are the three reasons why many people study overseas. The study abroad because it gives new opportunities through new connections, improves students tanlents by high quality courses, and grows students insights to be a global leader. Personally, I think studying abroad is a kind of an investment of time and passion for yourself. And with this aspect, I think the three reasons that I mentioned can be valid evidences to make a bold dicision. Studying abroad is a hard, expensive course. But I think it deserves it to try."	5	5	3.5	13.5
1515	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"   Have you ever been other countries for studying? Recently, many students go outside their home countries to study. Even among my friends, there are two friends who went out. Why do many people want to study abroad? In my opinion, significant reasons are how many people you can meet, how many different experiences you can do, what do you want to learn.
   First, if you attend school outside your home country, you can meet various people and communicate with them. Although there are some foreign students attending schools in your home countries, there are more students outside than that. The more various people you meet, the more ideas you can get while you're communicating with them. Because they lived in different background with you, their thoughts will also different with you, and you will learn a lot from them. This can be a big reason why many students study abroad.
   The second reason is that you can experience different cultures while you studying abroad. In your home country, you will experience just you already had during your entire life. Some people will like that more, but other people who want to experience something new will choose to attend schools outside. If you go schools abroad, you can learn not only their language but also their cultures such as their food, their hollidays, and even like what they enjoy during leisure time. In addition, you can explore many landmarks of their country during vacation.
   Finally, Students can go outside because there are no schools, which can teach you what you want to learn, in their home country. This reason is for usually students who graduated universisty and are going to get doctor(...?) degree. Their studying area might be too specific so that they cannot find proper school in their home countries but in other countries. Then, they go there to study what they want to do. 
   In conlusion, students can choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries to met many different people, to experience something new, and to study what they want to study. If you are in same case I mentioned, How about considering to attend schools outside? It will become your unforgettable memories and help your life."	4.5	5	4	13.5
1516	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Once you have already seen your freinds or cousins who chose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Today, I'll talk about Why do some students study abroad. 
The first reason, in my opinion is that why some students study abroad is the high quality of study environment. It is natural phenomenon that students want to study in school with high quality environment. High quality study environment can be devided in many kinds of factors. Factor can be high quality of educaition like nice teacher, professor or smart students. Or factor can be high quality of another environment like nice facility of domitory or taste of dishes which is in school cafeteria. Nice studying is fudamentally based on nice environment of studyding so many students go to abroad schools or university.
Second reason, in my opinion, some students study abroad because the future occupatin which students want in abroad is more developed than their home countries. Future occupatin is very important factor of students life because they can earn money and make family by having future occupatin. For instance in KAIST, many students want to go to nice USA university like MIT because USA has more nice future occupatin and recognition about science and math than Korea. Students can earn more money or participate in a great lab by study in abroad school.
Finally, the reason that some students study abroad is they have to choose abroad school by disaster or war. If the disaster is occured in home countries, people have to avoid the disaster and even they have to go to another country. In this case, students don't have a choice which choose their school. So some students unwillingly go to schools which is in abroad. Like refugee students, they have to go to school which is in their final destination not in ther country. 
In conclusion, abroad school has as high quality of education and delveloped future occupatin so students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Or by some reasons like disaster, they have to choose school which is in abroad."	4.5	5	3.5	13
1517	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"You can see many students who are studying on foreign country, and some other students envy them. Many universities know it that they try to expand the exchange with other country's universities. I think studying abroad has some advantages for students, universities, and country.
 First of all, studying abroad expands students' experience. For example, many countries have their own cultures such as languages, foods, and lifestyle. To study some majors, I think it is the most important to understand humans, because many research and studies are in process to make humans' life better so that understanding human must need for students, and learning other cultures can help it. Also, students can experience world's trend with study with other countries' students and professors. These experience can make students advance.
 Furthermore, studying abroad can increase country's academic level. Nowadays, many countries are studying together in many subjects. In these globalization, many professors go to other country's university to learn or study, and many students go to other country's university as an exchange student. Many countries try to expand this because they will be isolated if they don't do it. For example, in Japan, there are too few students go abroad that some degree of isolation has taken. So, Japanese government try to make their students go abroad with some policies. Like this, students go abroad is very important to advance country's academic level.
  Last, studying abroad can make students can go other countries which students were interested in. There are many students who want to live other countries but they also have worry about it. For these students, study abroad can help them because they have to stay in that country and they can learn about this country. Especially, if student go abroad as an exchange student, they can experience while short time and judge about the country like 'this country is good' or 'this country is bad'. So, study aborad is important for students to learn more about the country which they were interested in.
 In conclusion, studying abroad has many advantages for students, universities, and country. Students can expand their knowledge about other countries while living in other country. Countries can increase country's academic level with interacting. Students also can learn more about the country which they were interested in. As many transportations advanced and many people learn English, students studying abroad are increasing and it is beneficial for everyone that it would be good if many students participate on it."	5	5	4.5	14.5
1518	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  Is there a friend who went studying abroad around you? It is called studying abroad when a student goes to a different country than his or her own country. In most cases, student goes to college abroad, but sometimes from middle school or high school to study abroad. I also saw many friends who choose to study aborad while living in school for 12 years until this year. Based on the stories of my friends, I thought about why people go studying abroad.
  First of all, the most common case is going to learn a language. English and Chinese are the most commonly used lanfuages in the world, so there are many advantages to know English or Chinese well. When learning a language, living in a native language country is the  best way to learn it naturally. So there are students who go th Australia, New Zealand, the United States to learn English, China to learn Chinese, and Singapore to learn both. Like this, there are many students choose to study abroad for their fluent foreign language skills.
Secondly, there are somes casees that going a studying abroad for college. in this case, many students go abroad to study when they are young. And it can be divided two categories of going to foreign and domestic universities. Let's first consider the case of going to a foriegn uiniversity. KAIST and Seoul National University,is the best universities in Korea, but they are ranked among the top 30~50 in the world. Therefore, in order to go to a university that is better than the university in Korea, students are going to studying abroad in that country and entering the foreign university. ,Before we think about the case of going to a domestic university, we have to know that there is a foreign admission system in our country. This is typical of foreigners or students who graduated from foreign schools taking entrance exams, and the competition rate is often lower than that of general admission. Thus, to easily enter a top-ranked university in Korea, there are cases where students graduate from a foreign school."	3.5	4.5	4	12
1519	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"KAIST is very popular university for korean student and foreign student. Many foreign students are registered in KAIST, so you can watch people who came from another country easily.
However, if you meet them in class, you sometimes feel uncomfotable because of some international student's laziness and non-participation. That is, some of international student in KAIST show lower level performance than KAIST expected.
Reason of this phenomenon is their lack performaces are based on their lack of study. 

 First of all, they feel freedom so much. In their conuntry, they feel some of guilt because of their parent's effort for them. so they study hard because they want to pleasure parent and want to success.
but, they flight to other country, especially they come their university's country alone, they released from guilt about their parents. And then, they lived free style because they aren't monitered by other people like their parents.
consequently, it makes their few amount of study and their lazy attitude.

 Second, they need more time to adapt new country. if people go to new environment, almost of them feel nervous and uncomfortable because they don't know about their new environment that different to their home. so, they spend many time to adapt new environment. it is similar to international student's adapting process.  so, they have to know culture of other country and adapt that.

 Last, they spend many time to meet new friends and play with them. if they completely adapt their university, they perhaps make new friend. this means they spend more time to play with their friend, they don't spent time to study. 

in short, some foreign student study abroad because they feel freedom, need more time to adapt, and spend more time to play other thing."	4	4.5	3.5	12

 What is your plan after graduating university? Everyone will have different plans and goals. You can get a job at a company or you can study more. However, in my case, I want to study abroad. So I will talk about why I decided to study abroad in terms of cost, specialized fiield, and view.
 First of all. the cost of studyimg abroad was less than I thought. In many university, cost of studying abroad is supported at the university level. When you study hard and get high GPA, you can get lot's of additional money from university. So I am studying very hard to achieve my dream.
 Second, each graduate school has a different sepecialized field of study. The level of graduate schools in Korea is very high too but, most of the research is about engineering. Therefore, people who want to study natural science study abroad to other country.
 Lastly, you can broaded your view of the world. When you study abroad, you will face to new country. You must meet new people and fell new culture. Through this process, your ability that empathizing and understanding with people will increase. I think this is the most important ability in social life.
 In conclusion, some people study abroad because cost is not too expensive, specialized field of each graduate scool is different, and make your view broaden. I didn't wnat to study abroad until I was high school student. However, I got lot's of advices from my seniors about studying abroad and career these days, so now I want to study abroad. You should consider studing abroad. It can be a new option in your life."	4	4.5	4	12.5
1521	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Sonemone can ask, 'why people study abroad'? Because it is studying in forign countries, so they use different languages and cultures, making the students from other countries to suffer the lack of communication. And I think there are several reasons studying abroad. I am going to share the thoughts I have.

First reason of studying aborad is, that some countries have better studying environment than the countries that he or she has born.
Better studying environment can bring you better degrees and better workplace, that is very important for your life.
 For example, there are no doubt that the United states have very good colleges of mechanical&science all over the nations and they leads significant part of the new science project.
So, It would be better, for example to study in US than egypt, for example. In US, the students are researchers will get more informations about the research he or she is doing, and have more opportunity to develop and share the research informations with others.

Second, Students who study abroad can learn the culture and language of those countries.
In introduction, I have mentioned that students can suffer the lack of communication due to different languages and cultures. It is sure that someone doesn't like it. But it also can be another chance to learn the culture or language of the countries. Suffering such hardship, one can better understand the nations atmoshpere, culture, etc. This can be precious experience of the students who study abroad.

Third, there the cost of communications between nations diminished.
In past, There are several inconviences when going abroad. One of the main problem was that it costs a lot to use national call, which is well-known for 00700 in Korea. But times changes. Now we can use several no-cost methods to using data and network. By on-line conference programs, now people can talk with other people from thousand kilometers away.
And the relative cost of aireplane tickets lowered and also, now we have many the airplane companies to use, comparing to the past.
So, one can travel easily by choosing the cheapest airplane tickets he or she needs.

As conclusion, 
Studying abroad helps students to study in better studying environment and to learn the culture and language of those countries. And as the cost of communication of commuications between very long distance diminished. So, one can talk to his or her family everyday.
In 21st century, studying abroad is not the fancy, or impossible way to take.  II think it is open to many people, and can give you lots of opportunites. I hope this writing could change the view of the studying aborad."	5	5	3.5	13.5
1522	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I think my country,Korea, is good country among many countries around the world. It has much freedom than China and safety than USA. However, our country has much problem these days. So, I'll take some problems of our country and show the one important thing that our country should change.
First, we have gender problem. Once gender problem occured at 2015, argument between male and female has been intensified. It was true that woman has low chances about making their opinion for a long time. For that, many movement such as feminism has occured.  But radical part of them made many problem and wanted more special treatment. Eventually, the conflict between two for their right has been deepen. Even more, problems are occured continuously.
Second, we have inequality problem. We want some rewards as much as we strive. But specific people have more chance to make more money. Many people work hard to make good results and sometimes they make it. But it is fact that not every people gets right reward for their works. Sometimes, workers couldn't get their right reward from their company even if they worked hard. This causes discontent with society and the upper classes.
Next, we have little problem for offensive replying culture in some communities. Some comments make stress for some people.
I think these problems are threatening our society and spliting people up. So, if I can, I want to change the internet culture of our society. Our internet culture is very offensive because of its anonymity. Most of our problem comes up with these careless condition of our society. If the culture of understanding to other person is created, I think we can create a happier country. We are experiencing internet society because of many reasons. So, internet culture could change our society."	2.5	3	3	8.5
1523	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" In my county, Republic of Korea, almost every students go to an university after graduate a  highschool. According to the study of the eduction ministry, more than 80% of students go to university. Also, Only less than 20% of highschool students find some jobs or other way rather than colleges. Concequently, because of this education culture of my country, our society and technology could develop. However, the education system makes some problems nowadays. This is the reason why I think the education system should be changed.
 For the first detailed reason, many students highly get pressure because of this culture. Most highschool student use their 3 years of highschool life to prepare to go to an university. Moreover, students feel they have to go to an university, and feel depression if they fail to go to an university. Actually, many people who did not graduate university are living well. The graduation of university is not duty to live in the society. However, because of this edcuation culture and system, many people in our country think graduation is neccesery things, and they do not want to hire the people who do not have diploma. Thus, to reduce the stress of the students and make society healthy, this system and trend should be changed.
 Secondly, the quality of the universities have gradually decreased. Because of the first reason, too many student go to university to get the diploma. Also, people think the university as a extended step, like the additional highschool. Most of the students of university do not want to study more after graduate the school. They just want to use school as a step to get a job. Thus, the universities are not the education and investigation organizations. 
 For these reasons, I think there should be a change in the education system. To solve this problem, I want to divide universities into two group. One are the education and study colleges and other are job education organization. Students have rights not to get the stress. University have to make some devlop of their qulity. The Society should change the trend."	3.5	3	3	9.5
1524	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" As I'm in double major course in Nuclear and Quantum Engineering department, I want to change everyone's mind about nuclear reactor. Although I know some people may have skeptistic opinion of this and I understand what they want to point out, I'll tell the reasons and safety of nuclear reactor.

 Before I start, I need to emphasize that nuclear reactor is not same with atomic bomb. 
Uranium in nuclear reactor cannot make blast itself but just heating the fuel rod. You may heard about Fukushima or Chernobyl accidents. Yes there were explosion but blast in Fukushima was due to just safety system which remove rooftop before Hydrogen gas concentration becomes critical and  design/operating failure in Chernobyl case. I'll not discuss too much detail about them since it may become too long, I just claim that it was accident due to human and for normal operating case, It is very hard to make accident especially in Pressurized Water Reactor which our country use. So we are safe now.

 Anyway, Nuclear reactor is economical. This is my first reason. One reactor provides us 1GW of electricity. Since I cannot open the other browser to check exact value of other type of generator, I'll just say this is tremensously powerful. And only small amount of Uranium needed for this. So we can make electricity with lower cost than diesel generator or something. When electricity becomes cheaper, the cost to make something or use something in factory or household becomes cheaper. Then Korea can be rich more. Just simple logic. You may mention that wind power and solar power does not consume fuel but land to place them is also cost. Furthermore, they are not developed enough to make same electricity with nuclear reactor. For 1GW, one third of Seoul is needed for wind power case.

 And again, we have technology that extract dangerous material and uranium in used fuel rod. Only government policy is matter to do this. We can safely dispose the High level waste in underground about 500m from ground, and They cannot escape from engineering barrier before the activity of waste is not considerable anymore. Technology is already there but USA worry about possibility that Korea makes atomic bombs. This is one and only reason that we cannot dispose or recycle our used fuel.

 Finally, because time is not enough, Nuclear reactor is safe and will be more in future. I already said about safety before start, Let me just introduce 4th generation nuclear reactor, which in progress to design. Philosophy about 4th generation nuclear reactor is for safety, economics and resistance to make nuclear weapon. For example, people in research are designing Thorium reactor which is perfectly safe from nuclear accident, or liquid metal coolant reactor which is also very safe. Our technology is developed more and more. Only matter is government policy and people's mind.

So I want to change people's mind about nuclear reactor for good. I want to discuss more but since time is not enough, I'll stop here.
Thank you for reading."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

One of the record is ' rate of youngman choosing death by theirselves'. And also reason why student or children choose death is academic stress. In korea, Almost people think that entering good college or university  is very important and make sure their life wonerful and beautiful.
 In this condition, some of student can fell good because they enter good school. But almost of other student feel stress. This stress not only make student feel bad, but also break their health and mind. Many student have mental disease. But they can't go hospitol or doctor, because they have to study instead of going doctor. 
 Also many talent are broken by  study.  Many parents say that study is one of the best way to make  and making money by otherthing is vert hard. In this environment, we can't see people who like Mozart, Dante and other famous artist.  In one study, many student do not have any ideea of their life after they enter university. Their school is choosed by their score. So they don't know about what are their talent. 
Therefore I want to change our country's study system. We shoud give chance that student find their talent and interesting to student. This change make our country more various and efficeintly.  Finally we can make stronger and more powerful country in the future."	3.5	3.5	3	10
1526	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I want to change population imbalance which is prevale in these days especially city by city, if i could change one important thing about my country. 
 Polulation imbalance makes harmful effect on all aspects of our lives. While It makes great city more great, it makes poor city more poor. Specifically, it incurs surge in price of real-estate by exceeding physically tolorable population in the city. Also, hot issue of these day in my country is concerned with real-estate problem. Government think that solution to stop the problem is on the  regulation. But, in my opinion, more fundamental solution is to scatter population evenly all around the nation. By doing so, we can expect the nation to balancely improve each other in terms of population and price of apartment.
 One can ask ""How we can make scattering population evenly?"". The answer to this question is to encourage and invest into the business which could represent color of each city. For example, Ulsan is popular with making something. There are a lot of factory, such as Hyundai Motors, KIA Motors  and etc. Also, Daejeon could be another example. Daejeon is popular with the city of science. It has KAIST, a lot of laboratory from big company and government.    "	3.5	3.5	3	10
1527	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I want to change a university entrance examination, because students have to suffer from stress. I think it’s more important to study harder in the university rather than high school. 
First, I want to change current entrance examination policy that choose student based on grades. Entrance examination policy will consider nonsubject activity and  passion of students. In this way, students reduce their stress from higi school grades. I know this policy could have disadvatnates about fairness. Nevertheless, simply lining up students based on grades is not good way. I saw friends who didn’t well study Liberal Arts Course, but did well study their intersting majors. So, I think that studnet interest and nonsubject activity is more important than high school grades.
Second, I want to increase admission quota of university, and make strict drop out policy. Students can have more opportunity through higher admission quota, and can develop oneself through competition among students. Excessive competition negatively affects students, but it is a problem that students in Korean universities graduate too easily.
I want to make high school students have more opprotunity, and university students have more competitiveness by change som e entrance examination policy and admission quota"	3.5	3	3	9.5
1528	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Republic of Korea, our country, is very amazing country. 50 years after becoming a poor country after the war, our country has become one of the most advanced countries. However,  because of the surprisingly rapid growth, there are  a lot of problems that need to be fixed. One of the important thing that I think should be changed is about the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family(MOGEF). It should be abolished.
MOGEF is  the department in charge of improving women's status through women policies and working on youth and family affairs. The purpose seems to be good and therefore doesn't look like it should be abolished. However, they have caused so many controversies and don't know what the problem is. For example, they almost do nothing when the ""#METOO"" incident first happened. They had to make some policies that can protect victims of sexual assault from perpetrators, but they didn't so long time. Also, they violated the rights of teenagers through the shutdown system. This policy prevents the development of the game industry. One youth professional gamer even experienced the termination of the game during the competition. They often distort the statistics to support their opinions. They insist that the women rights of our country is in very low level using incorrect statistics. However, the level of gender equality of our country is very high.
They are still distorting the truth and do only what they want. As long as they do such a way, the abolishment of MOGEF will be indispensable."	3	3	3	9
1529	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  There is many problems in Korea, but if I have the chance to change one important thing about Korea, I will change the major selection in university first. There is two reason why I will change he major selection in university first.
 First, in Korea, there are too many high school students who choose thier major by their grade, not by their interest. Most of high school 3rd grade students choose their university and major. But in this choise, since their grade is not enough to take both, most students confront with problem that they have to forgive either university or major. And in this case, many students choose the university, instead of major. This make many students have the major without their interest. So to release this problem, I think university should choose freshman without major, like KAIST.
 Second, in high school, we may not understand what we learn in the specific major. When KAIST students enroll the KAIST, they check the major that want to go. But after a year, many students choose the major which is different with major they choose 1 years ago. It means studying a university subjects and other experinments in university affect the major selection.
 As I mention above, there is many problems in choosing the major in high school. So I think we should chage to choose the major after university 1st grade."	3.5	3.5	3	10

because most stduents think that grade will take up almost of their lives. but when they grow up and come to society, almost knowledge that learned in school is not nessesary.
we need to change our education to teach more real life knowledge.
knowledge only studied in school is not very useful in our life, it just need some people who will study deeply such as researchers. 
In elementary and junior schools, we need to change like students can directly experience various acticities and learn knowledge in the activities such as math, art, other language...etc.
and in high school, student choose their major according to aptitude and learn deeper. 
I think that it will be more helpful to them for live better."	3	2	3	8
1531	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"My country is Korea and every young man in Korea go to army. So, if I can change one important thing in our country, I would like make no young man go to army.
 There are several reasons why I think like that.
 First, since technologies are improved, it is useless to have a lot of troops in the army. 
 Nowadays, technologies are developed and a lot of strong weapons like missile, submarine etc are made. We don't need to use a lot of people to use these weapons. We just need some people who operate them. So, I think it is useless to have a lot of troops in the army. 
 Second, a lot of problems and accidents are made by the system which makes young man in Korea go to army.
 We can see the news like 'In army, some soliders hit other solider and he get serious injury' or 'One solider shoot gun to other solider' etc. It shows that a lot of problems and accidents are made by young man go to army. Some people say these are very special case and almost every people don't have problems and accidents like that. However, there are more problems and accidents that happens which are not in the news and there are a lot of people get damaged by accidents like that. So, a lot of problems and accidents are made by the system which makes young man in Korea go to army.
 Third, I think already a lot of people think young man don't need to go to army. 
 For example, the time young man must go to army is decreasing. 20 years ago, young people should go to army for 2 year and 3 month, and 10 years ago, young people must go to army for 1 year and 9 month, and now, young people must go to army for 1 year and 6 month. It shows that a lot of people think it is meaningless to spend time in the army.
 In conclusion, if I can change one important thing in our country, I would like make no young man go to army because, since technologies are improved, it is useless to have a lot of troops in the army, and a lot of problems and accidents are made by the system which makes young man in Korea go to army, and I think already a lot of people think young man don't need to go to army.

1532	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Todays, the problems like income gap, discrimination, and some political issues are pervasive. Everything about them is critical issue. Many governments have tried to improve that issues, but it is too hard to be fixed immediately. For example, the current government increased the minimum income level to give low-income people much money. However, in the perspective of economical theory, it makes income gap much bigger by worsening the supply shortage. Like this, these kinds of problems are hard to overcome in the common ways. In this context, I think  the only and the natural way is effective ‘moral’ eduration for the following two reasons.
 Firstly, the education is the simplist root solution. The word, ‘moral’ education means something like Nobless Oblige, consideration.   Now, let’s think about the cases I mentioned above one by one. The Income gap’s solution is simply, the redistribution of wealth. As far as the government realized it by using the laws like taxes. It shows the directly effects, but people have a negative emotions. If most of the high-income people are morally educated, the redistribution is naturally occured as well as the negative emotions disappears. In addition, the conflicts between poeple like men-women discrimination will also be smoothly improved. The moral people will use the soft word to each other while discussing and the unnecessary bad words will be reduced.
 Secondly, the morally educated people have an tendency to propagate positive effects to others. In the korea, there is a non-profit group 5that educates high-level morality. They don’t show the great result during the first 5 years, but only makes 'moral people’ linearly. During the next 5years, they shows the statistics that the positively affected person doubles  in every year. Like this case, regardless of the bad or good thing, the traditions or habbits can be spreaded exponentially. Before the bads totally covered the whole society, the goods must be spreaded widely.  
 In conclusion, because the positive people tends to propagate the positive effects of the education, which is the only root solution,  I think the ‘moral’ education is more effectively changed part in my country. The current education in my country only emphasizes the importance of language, science, society. However, it only reproduces the bad conflicts in the country more and more. Now, it’s time to break it out. The first step to realize it is, right and great ""morality education""."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
1533	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change an important thing of my country, I would change our capital city, Seoul. Then let me give some reason for my opinion.
First, urban plan of Seoul is not good. Let's think about morning and afternoon of Seoul. Subway and bus are full of people and every roads also full of cars. The traffic problems are very serious. Many number of propotion can cause easily these problems. However, let's come up with Newyork's case. It has much narrower roads than Seoul's,  and more people have their job in Newyork than Seoul. But the traffic problem of them is not much serious like Seoul. That is one of clue of the bad urban plan of Seoul.
Second, I think Seoul has not much our traditional culture. Our traditional culture like architecture, art and clothes are very special and beautiful. But I think Seoul didn't represent them well. It's hard to find out traditinal architecture in Seoul. If some foriegn traveler want to see a Han-ok, he should go to some special places like Buk-chon or Gyeongbokgung. So I want to build more traditional building in some downtown of Seoul.
Finally, Korean local unbalance is very serious. Seoul has too many central functions of Korea.  So I think some functions should be carried to another city."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
1534	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  I think that punishment about smoking  in public place should be changed. In korea,  smoking is not forbidded in the public place except some city.  As a result of it, almost smoker smokes in the street, park, etc where people who dont smoke can be affected by the smokes. So, I insists that  smoking should be strickly prohibitted in the public place. There are sevral reasons why smoking should be restricted. 
  First of all, smoking is much wrose for non-smoker. In the case of smoker, they drink smokes through the filter which can block the harmful thing such as heavy-metal. However, when non-smoker drinks smokes through the smoker without filter, it would not be filltered smoke, so that it is much harmful than the smokes for smoker. 
  Secound, smoking can make fire. There are sevral cases of fire because of the sigarette.  If smoker throw away the sigarette after smoking without checking that fire is gone, it can make  the other thing to burn. Especially in Fall and Winter, the air is so dry that it is much easier to start the fire. In the case of view, if smoking is allowed in specific place, the probabillity of fire would be decreased. 
  I show you two reasons why we should restrict smoking. Smoking is Ok. But, what if we consider other people who don't smoke. I think it would be much better world if we consider other people. "	3.5	3.5	3	10

" If the question means I can change any one thing in our country like god, I want to delete covid 19 in our country. But I think it maybe about making some policy to change, so let's think about it. If we want to change something to improve our country, we have to know what is the problem of our country. Ofcourse there would be a lot of problems in the country like covid 19, but I don't know or a lot of them or their solution. So I want to focus  what I realize alot now. It is the problem of English.
 Korean students study hard in high school. So  I heard that they get almost top grade in the test compare to other country.  But many Korean doesn't do well in universe that much. Many reasons maybe causes it like they play alot in university, but I think English is one of the biggist reason. 
 When we learn biology or chemistry, we have to learn all term when we learned before Korean. When we take lecture, we take English lecture instead of Korean lecture like before. It is hard to Korean student like me,  But it is needed to study and communicate with other country. So we should not change our university, but we should change before university.
 We have to think about the reason of the problem. Korean students also study English hard. what made the problem? I think it is because they just study to do test well. It is not that much useful to take lecture or make their opinion in English. So I think Korean student should study English more for that technologies. They are focused on going good university, so university should focus on that when they choose student "	3.5	3.5	3	10

I think most of Korean are good at math. However , many highschool students give up math.
I have thought about this situation for a long time and I found out very important reason.
In my opinion, the reason is the method to teach math in school is wrong.
I have studied math in vary class. For example, I studied at ordinary middle school, high school for genius, and classes out of school.
In middle school, teachers taught math by using wrong way. They just said ""memorize this formula"".
They didn't think importantly why we need to solve these problems or why people made these formulas.
So they taught only how to solve the problems or how to easily momorize the formulas.
I  think math is study about ""Why"". Although result is important, reason is more important in math.
in Korean math education, students are hard to study reason, they only study result and formula and skill.
As a result, most of students lose their interest in math and give up math.
I want to change method or mathematics education from 'memorize formula' to 'ask why'."	3.5	3	3	9.5

"I think there are many  economic problems in our country because of  Covid 19. And my familiy will move apartment next month, I think the biggest problem is  cost of apartments is very expensive.  So, if  I could change one important thing about my country, I would change the cost of apartment of Korea. 
The first reason of changing cost is that this situation makes the huge economic problems.  The abnormal cost  makes range between the people who have the apartment and the people who do not larger.  And this is a huge economic range. So the economy is getting worse. For example, there was a simillar situation in Japan.  The Japan's apartment cost was too expensive to buy. As a result, there are few people who have the apartment, and most people doen't have the apartment today. We have to changing the cost for not being like a japan.
The second reason is expensive cost of apartments makes the birth rate low.  Korea's birth rate is the lowest in all over the world.  And there are many factors that make the birth rate low.  The biggest reason of the low birth rate is economic difficulty.  The young generation doen't have enough money to buy an apartment. Also they don't want to get their baby because they use almost money to buy an apartment and they  don't have a money to care their baby. So this causes the low birth rate.
Accroding to these two reasons, I would change the cost of apartment of Korea. "	3.5	3.5	3	10

" I choose start-up support policy as important thing to be changed. There are two reasons by changing start-up support policy. First, it is base for activating local economy. Some creative ideas are easily idealized in Seoul or neighbor cities. Thus the young go to seoul and local country age is older, which means that our contry, Daegu, undergoes fall of textile industry and then has no more local industry as economy base. To bring them to out country,  start-up support policy should be more attractive and aggresive than before. Consecontly it activates local industy in the other aspect. And second, it would make our contry more energetic and change our country image. Dague has prejudice that we are old and conservative values than other country. I think it follwes generation distribution. My surrounding people with the same age want to go colledge and company near Seoul. As a result, it is leak of young generation and hardens local image of Daegu. The people who are caught by attractive start-up support policy may be more creative and energetic and could induce changing of local image. So I want to change start-up support policy of our country. "	3.5	3.5	3	10

1540	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" KAIST is great university. It has lots of great professors and students, researching atmosphere with passion, and massive information for study. But I think there is the only one thing  that KAIST should change. KAIST should make a tunnel through Hill Eoeun. It probably sounds weird, so now I'll explain why the tunnel should be constructed now.
  First reason is that student in western KAIST dormitory can't excess their lecture rooms well. Many of KAIST lectures are provided in eastern or northern buildings, especially E11. The western dormitory is in the opposite site from them through the hill. According to the interview of a student living in Heemang dormitory, ""We should go around the hill everyday."" He added, ""If I want to go to N1, I should start walking advanced to 30 minutes.""
  Second, there is no people in the dormitory this semester. Constructing tunnel could make a lot of noise to students who live in a dormitory. However, now there are only few students because COVID-19 limited students not to get into the dormitory. So, it seems to be a great chance to make a tunnel in this semester. According to the statistics, even if we get vaccine of the virus this March, the mass immune would be created since this November 2021.
  The final reson is that we can get a cool passage during the summer season. Tunnel is quite chill because it is in underground. This could provide cool passage without making any air conditioning structure. Students have to take a long way to reach dormitory with hot condition. By this tunnel, students could get into the dormitory in less tired condition. So, it could make a less electiricity usage.
  It is the timing to make a giant tunnel throught Hill Eoeun. Western dormitory students claim for their imcomfortableness accessing the dormitory. Also, this is the best timing to build it with less pain of constructing noise. Also, we could get a cool place without using extra electricity.There aren't many students in a dormitory because of the COVID-19 situation, so probably we don't need it this year. However, we can feel the imconfortableness when we restart a face-to-face lecture after the situation. So, we need to start to make a tunnel through Hill Eoeun."	4	4.5	4	12.5
1541	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  There are many specific rules in my university, KAIST. Some of the rules are very special and hepful for students, but others are not , and students do not want to follow them. I also feel uncomfortable due to these rules and systems for five years, and there is the most  important thing that I think it should be changed. If I can change one system in KAIST, I would like to remove or adjust the rule which force freshman students to take fun college life and exciting college life. There are -- reasons why I think this system should be modified. 
  First of all, the two essential courses take too much time of students. They are on weekday evening and lasts about three hours. Every week, students must spend more than three hours where they do not want it because the classes are a graduation requirement. Thus, many students do not want to take the courses and complain the waste of time. In my freshman group, about 20 students do not wish to take this course, and It is almost 70% of our group. Even though many students do not prefere them, the school have not make any alternative to reduce the stress of students. To sum up, the courses spend too much valuable time of freshmans, and there is not any method to solve this problem from the school.
  Secondly, the contents of the courses are not useful and helpful for freshman students. According to the rumor, the two courses were designed to prevent students from suicide and adapt students to the school. However, in the courses, students just listen to some lectures and play some games and activities with freshman group members. There is not any function of the courses. Thust, many students feel these lectures are not efficient. One student in my freshman group even said, ""This lectures are a waste of time. I feel that tution fee for these courses is a waste.""  Consequently, many students think the courses are not useful for their school lifes.
  In conclusion, the two necessery courses for freshman are not useful systems. Many students are want to not spend their time to these course, and they also want to use that time for something useful. To solve the problem, I want to change the graduation requirement so that every students can choose these courses."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1542	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  Do you like walking? Whatever you answered, I strongly guess that you don't want to walk over 20 minutes to take the lecture only. However, if we can take offline class again, this problem may become reality. In my case, I already walk about 30 minutes to go to the laboratory. So, I want to change the area of our university small, and I think it has so many benefits.
  First, everyone can save their time. As I already mentioned, I use 1 hours everyday for just walking. If the distance becomes shorter, I and everyone else in KAIST can save our time. Please notice that 20 minutes per day is approximately 5000 minutes per year. We can use that time to the other valuable activities, rather than just moving to other buildings.
 Secondly, maintanence cost of our university becomes lower. I once saw people planting trees on empty space. Since it was not beautiful at all, I felt it is meaningless. If there is no empty meaningless space, those money used in planting trees may used for us.
 Finally, we can meet friends more often. Since our dormitories are too much scattered, people living at east side cannot easily meet west side. You may strongly agree that meeting people in reality is important in terms of students' mental health and communication abilities due to COVID-19. So, short physical distance makes people more healthy.
  Thus, if our university becomes smaller, we can not only save our time and money, but also we can care our mental health. you may disagree with me, since large empty space gives you some kind of freedom. What I want to say them is, please note that the number of students is about one third in KAIST comparing with the other universities."	4	3.5	4	11.5
1543	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Many students who study in KAIST say, ""There are too many assignment to get take a rest"". KAIST makes student study more than the other university students.  So  I want to change assignments in this university with some reasons.
First, many assignment has same or similar deadline. Some people said, ""Why is this problem?"".  Student can't takes a rest after they clear one assingment. Student should do their assingment everyday during semester. For example, in last semester, freshmen should do their Derivation and Integral assingment until Thursday and Physics and Linear argebra assingment until Friday. Many freshmen couldn't sleep in Thursday night to finish their assingment.
Second, level of assingments is not easy. If assingments are easy, I may not talk about this topic. Each assingments has problem which make students think deeply. Student should spend time to solve these problem. Although students spend a lot of time to solve one problem, sometimes they can't solve every problem. Also Zoom class and record class make level of assingment higher than before. So many students included freshmen were suffered by difficult problem in last semester. 
Finally, almost of lectures give assignment to student. Most of professor give assingment to increase students' level.  Assingment makes student to study and review, but a lot of assingment make student hard and sick. One statistic show that freshmen who enter university this year think a lot of assingment is one of the most hard thing in university. 
 In conclusion, assingment makes students study and review, but many assingment give suffer to student. I want to make system which makes professors discuss about amount of assingment, and  give small and not very hard assingment to student.  "	4	4	3.5	11.5

" My university, KAIST, is great univiersity for science & technology, but I like to change one important thing. This is region of my university. KAIST is located in Deajeon. This characteristic has little advantages, but if KAIST was located in Seoul, there were many advantages.
     First, KAIST can assemble talent students in Seoul. Many students want to live in Seoul because Seoul is center in Korea. Many culture facilities, and companies are located in Seoul. That is, students who entered in KAIST, may lose opportunity to enjoy cultural life. In this reason, some talent students prefer Seoul National University rather than KAIST.    
      Second, KAIST can link easily between students and companies. Most start-ups and popular companies have office in Gangnam or Pankyu for getting more business chances, so it is more hard for KAIST to send students to companies as intern. Also, when KAIST send students to companies in seoul, students, who don’t live in seoul, should  find little house with expensive monthly fees.
     To sum up, if KAIST was located in Seoul, more talent students entered in KAIST, and KAIST cooperated more easily with companies. In these above reasons, KAIST AI graduate university will be located in Seoul. "	4.5	4.5	4	13
1546	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"There are many students in KAIST. They entered KAIST through either rolling admission or regular decision. Although they can enter KAIST through regular decision, almost all students enter through rolling admission. This is because KAIST rarely recruits students through regular decision. However, I think more students should be able to register for KAIST through regular decision.
First, it can reduce the feeling of alienation of general high school students. Most of students in KAIST graduated from the science high school. Actually, 70% of KAIST students are from the science high school. Many high schools have few students, so students from there tend to already know each other. Therefore, students from the general high school can feel as excluded from them. If the registeration rate of entrance through regular decision increases, the rate of general high school students in KAIST will increase, so they will feel less left out.
Second, more intelligent students can enter KAIST. In one interview, a student who tried to enter KAIST through regular decision, but failed, said, ""KAIST recruits few students from regular decision. I got great grade in CSAT, but I failed to get accepted to KAIST."" This clearly shows that clever students cannot enter KAIST due to an admission quota of regular decision. If KAIST increases the recruitment number of student from regular decision, more wise students will have a chance to register for KAIST.
In summary, the increase of recruitment of regular decision can reduce alienation of general high school students, and it can cause the increased number of more clever students in KAIST.  In this year, only four students registered for KAIST thorugh it. It is one of the fewest number of recruitment of the university in Korea. Therefore, KAIST should allow that more students can enter through regular decision."	4.5	4.5	4	13

1549	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    Everyone regrets what they did and imagine the situtation that it changes. Since college students spend their first time of society on their college, there may be more regrettable events. Junior students are, especially, easy to do such mistakes. In my case, I have some events which I want to change when I was a first year student of KAIST. All the events are caused by excessive drinking. Therefore, if I can change one important thing about my university, I will restrict students not to drink freely and give specicial education on drinking for the following reasons.
   First, most of the severe events in the university come from over-drinking. For example, because KAIST does not restrict dormitory entering time, a lot of students start drinking lately, and continues drink until the morning. This makes students feel free from the rule of university, and students become easy to drink excessively. In addition, Statistics of the company SERVEY INC. prove that rules which restricts drinking can reduce the severe campus’ event  about 30%. This value is quite big, and it means that appropriate restriction is necessary for the safe university.
    Next, bad habbits on drinking can be developed after graduation. According to a survey of university association, 74% of graduated students feel that bad habits from undergraduated school life remain, and 88% of people feel that they lose their ablilty to think normaly when they drink too much. It means that the bad drinking habits are easy to be remained after the graduation. The main purpose of the university is not only an education on major subjects, but also an education on morality. Therefore, educations on excessive drinking should be conducted to the junior students to make them moral people.
    In conclusion, because many extreme happenings are from over-drinking, and the drink habbits can be continued after graduation, rule of KAIST about drinking should be changed. Specifically, some education that prevent junior students from addiction on drinking are necessary. The niversity should revise other way to improve current situations."	4	4	4	12
1550	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    In these days, one of my worried thing is my grade. In my university, KAIST, students should get the grade which is higher than 2.7 point. If we not, we can't take many benefits. Therefore, I think that this grade rule should disapear because of these two reasons.
     First of all, this rule reduces happiness of the students. I think you have heard about suicide of KAIST students. Several years ago, the sad events were pretty big  news. There are strong relationship between the grade rule and these bad news. According to statistics, ratio  of KAIST students' suicides increases 50% after the beginnig the grade rule. This result clearly show that the satisfaction about their school life of students badly decreases.
     Second, because of this rule, the freedom of choosing our own road is decrease. Let's assume that a student want to take some lectures of other major. However, he or she can't easily follow their choice. Because, he or she should take the lectures with the student who have that major, so he or she have high risk about bad grade. One of KAIST student Risa said, ""When I took the other major's lecture, I got a baddest grade in that semester. After that, I decide to forgive the challenge."" 
     To sum up, the grade rule can reduce not only students' happiness but also freedom of choosing their own intrests. Therefore, if KAIST cares about students' satisfying school life, they should erase thin grade rule in universty law."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1551	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"       Do you think which one makes the KAIST students cannot study well? I think the policy that the professors have to teach only in English makes the KAIST students cannot study well.  Of course, teaching in English has several benefits for students, but  I think it has more negative points. I will talk about the two reasons why I think this policy is not good for the students.
       First of all, there are some KAIST students who are poor in English. When the high school students take the exams to go to KAIST, they do not take the English exam. In other words, KAIST does not care about the students' English skill, because KAIST is the special university for science and technology. Because of this reason, the English skills of the students in KAIST are very various. I think some students cannot understand the classes well because their English is poor. I think it is not good situation that they cannot study well because of  language.
       Secondly, KAIST is the university for Korean. One reason of this policy is that there are many foriegn students in KAIST. However, if they want to study in KAIST, I think they should learn Korean first. I think it is very important manner that learning their languages before I go to the other countries. Therefore, foriegn students should study Korean to learn in KAIST.
       To sum up, because of these two reasons, I think only using English in the major classes should be changed. It will help that more students can understand the major classes well. Then their abilities will increase, too. I think it is more helpful for both the students and KAIST."	4	4	3.5	11.5

1554	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" After I entered KAIST, I can expand my point of view toward the world. However, I also feel limited because many students go to the graduate school after they finished the undergraduate course. It looks like there is no other choice after graduation. Thus, I think it is neccesary that the school has to support students to jump up chances for deveopments without only one way for graduate school, and there are two reasons.
 First, the location of KAIST is not adapt to catch other experience and information. In Korea, many companines are located to the capital region. It means that students who go to the university in the capital region have more opportunites to contact them easily. Also, almost information related to them may not pass to KAIST students. Because this infomation is considered as privated thing or secret, the person who wants to know that should make personal relationship. However, the physical distance limits KAIST students. KAIST should try to provide help to make interactions between KAIST students and related people.
 Next, even if KAIST notices the internship programs to KAIST students, it is not general. For example, SK intership implements in every summer or winter. In contrast to the range of possible majors which were uploaded in KAIST portal, the number of majors which thery want in real is n limited. KAIST admission could think they are suppoting students enough, but internships they release in KAIST portal are possitve effects to only small student.
 As a result, my opinion for chainging one important thing about KAIST is that the more effort is needed to support students in order to catch the chance of viewing other ways after graduation. Although the internet develops and provide information, there is limiataion by physical distance. In addition, the provided interships are not always good to overall students."	4.5	4.5	4	13
1555	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" KAIST, which is my university, is one of the best university in Korea. It has lots of professors and labs, and they also do various researches. One of the reasons why they can make a good work is that KAIST is located in Daejeon. Most of laboratories of goverment and companies are located in Daejeon. However, if I can change one thing in KAIST, I will change the location of KAIST from Daejeon to Seoul, because there is much more advantages, if students didn't enter graduate school.
 First of all, Daejeon dosn't have many culture and art performance. In Korea, high school students do not have enough time to enjoy culture and art performances. So, the time when they go to university is the only chance to enjoy those. But, if university is in Daejeon, they have to go Seoul or other places which the preformances are played. It is time and energy wasting. When KAIST is in Seoul, they can enjoy performaces easily. They have many chances to watch musicals, artist's performance, and exhibitions. They can even enjoy the busking in road or street exhibitions. 
 The second thing is about meeting other people. In Daejeon, especially at KAIST, we only meet people we know. It is hard to meet someone who don't know. It leads students to be idiots. They cannot share their ideas, and they don't have any chance to listend other major's idea. It keeps them trapped in their thoughts. It is a big disadvantage when they go to or make companies. However, in Seoul, there is many chances to meet other people. There is many events and clubs to meet others. Even though they miss the chances, they still have chances to meet others who major other in their university. It's a big advantage when they go to and make companies. According to the article, companies prefer the person who have many chance to meet other majors.
 In conclusion, if KAIST is in Seoul, there must be more advantages than disadvantages for students. They can enjoy arts, performance or exhibitions easily and they can meet lost of people who has different thinking with them. It leads them to be better people. "	4.5	4.5	4	13

First, it makes the street clean. As people go outside and do their tasks, they would buy something like having food or drinking coffee. Therefore, they are supposed to get trash periodically. Since there are no trash bins, people just put trash on the street.
Compare to other countries, second, it is absolutely true that more trash bins are necessary. In Australia, there are enough trash bins on streets. Bins are almost at every corner of blocks. It make people’s life convenient.

Some people think military is best place to clearing their mind and think about their future. But, this opinion doesn't considering why rest amount of time is given to soldier. Military is not a good place to do self-development. Many military base is in the country side even they located top of the mountain. This penalty can make lack of supplying resource from outside. Also, many base is lack of instrument because base builds too long time ago. So that, soldier has forcely their time that can't communicate outside well and situated lack of resource anvironment when end of day work.  Korea needs to change this military system."	3	3	3	9

Our country had hard time through 1890~1945 because of colonism, and then by the Korean War  and following  results. Passing through that hard time, we lost a lot of resources, people, and sites with our tradition. In addition, people had terrible memory because of it. This change is not possible, but it would be pleasure to imagine about rewriting the history.  This imagination can give motivation to know our history well, and keep bright side of it. 
At first, if we have preserved resources in Korea, economy of our country would be better. We can guess by Norway and other countries  whose GDP is high thanks for many resources. If we also had a lot of resources, we may don't need to work and study hard to have comfortable life. 
Secondly, many people  would be safe without the period. Many inocent people have dead through the period. Men had to participate the war or work for coal, and women had to go other coutries as nurses, or Jeong-Shin-Dae. These are terrible memory for them and their family. We need to know about that, and should not repeat the terrible history. 
Lastly, many sites and historical heritage will be remained.  They would help to study our history more easily and have precious time to see or visit them. We should try to get back the historical things from other countries and preserve them.

Stock tax means, if we sell or buy the stocks and get award money or lose original money,  we have to return several.

We are not centralized economic, and also we have already too many taxes.
 There's no rational reason for taxing, just blocking gambling they said. 
Make award is my own ability and effort, not sharing. 
It means, as we are in capitalic economic, owning individual capital is legal.
Even we have to pay tax, 20% of award is too much.

1562	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" After the Korea War, South Korea has been always trained the soldiers to protect our country from other countries especially North Korea. Man of Korea should go to army and trained for more than 2 years (Now, the term is shrinked to 18 months). But there're some serious problem I think in Korea about the military. If I could change one important thing about my country, Korea, I would change some millitary system.
  First, I want the people to respect the soldiers. Since every males serve the military, people tends to feel that it isn't that proud thing. For example, for the soldier's vacation, they should stay near to their base. The stores near to base sell products more expensive to soldiers than others. And also the companies started not to give advantage to the man who work for Korea for 18 months. These makes soldiers not to work hard. Because it doesn't feel proud. I will change our mind to feel thanks and be respectful to the soldiers.
  Next, I will change that some females also enter the military instead of weak males. The number of babies is decreasing. So the number of males will decrease. But the number of soldiers that Korea military needs isn't change. This is because Korea military should conquer the North Korea if the war occur. So it tries to pick weaker males for training. I think this isn't good idea. Instead, picking strong women for military rather than weak men will make military stronger.



If I have power to change one important thing in Korea, I will change some military system which is changing Korean's mind to respect soldiers, pick stronger women rather than weak men for the army."	3.5	3.5	3	10
1563	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" If I could change one important thing about my country, I would change the education policy especially about the system of entering an university. In China,  the only  and the most common way to go to a university is that taking an university entrance exam which named gaokao  and entering the university only by the grades of the exam. So there are three important reasons that I want to change the education policy in our country.
    First of all, students always get  too much stress from the exam which is the most important and biggest reason of  all.  The policy of  entering an university shows that whether a student can go to a good university or not is only decided by last one exam. Therefore, most of students feel extremely stressed when they are in third grade of high school. As far as we concerned, too much stress is harmful to our body and it always makes too much trouble between friends.
   Secondly, it is not fair to everyone. Eventhough a student graduates a high school in good grades, that not mean the student also go to a good university. We have too big exams in high school, one is for graduating a high school and one is for entering a high school. Thus if a student get good scores in high school  graduation exam but does not take the university entrance exam, then he cannot enter a university without any reason. That is not fair since although someone do great in his all 3 year in high school, the last one exam of high school can only decide his future.
   Finally, there are few activitys to make students excited. Since entering a good university or not is such a important problem, most of the high school does not give students to do many activities. Especially in the third grade of high school, students will only have the course which are in exam and one more P.E class. That makes a student so stressful and tired that even there were some students gave up their lives.
   To conclude, Chinese education policy  especially about the system of entering an university is not perfect and I hope one day the policy will be changed."	3.5	3	3.5	10

" In these day, the phrase 'discrimination crime' become famous. Society start notice there is lot of discrimination in this word, and try to remove it. As this social atmosphere, I want to change Korean to they have more common sense of human rights.
 First, human rights are most basic things to be protected. Even South Korea's elementry school textbook says 'human rights is needed to make human life normal at least'. Almost every countries, also Korea, admits all people have human rights and it should be protected by law. However, some Koreans not understand it and try to remove it from social minority, such as foreigner, religious, disability, and gender. Therefore, I want to make retellaly every person understand that human rights are general. 
 Also,  to against human rights hurts and kill person directly in these day. For example, Coupang, the korean online shopping and delivery company, are famous for not take care thier employees so that more than 40 employees died in workspace in 1 year. Because the company not keeps general rule for worker, workspace become danger. Moreover, the ex-soldier who be expelled from the military because she changed her gender is found as dead body in her house yesterday. To against human rights makes not only just discrimination, but also physical/mental damage and victim.
 To summarize, Korean should notice that human right for everyone is common thing so that make Korea more safe country from non-sense danger situation. I also keep my opinion in my mind everytime, and spread it to other people."	3	3	3	9

"The tax is a common way that the most nations use to redistribute the wealth. So Korea also use the tax like other countries. But, I think it is too much so that it causes several complex problems.  It is my old thinking about my country that Korean tend to hate rich people and refer to them as evil. But, I think it can't be justify that defining the rich as evil just because they have much money than other.  I'd like to change the tax. Now, Korean tax is too high than other OECD countries. Specifically, income tax and  property tax are too high. In usual case, the ratio of income tax who gets 0.1M dollars per year is 1/3. But, most of salary worker don't take the load of tax as much as them. And, about the case of property tax, the highest 10% take  half of the tax load. I think it is too severe about high-salary workers that making them they can't gather their money faster than other salary workers, even they have high ability and show great performance at their workplace.  I think the goverment have to motivate them with low tax to generate more value, and it will be positive effects of out economy. So I'd like to decrease the direct tax like income&property tax.

  If I could change one important thing about my country, I would change the test policy in high school. In Korea, there is big test for entering college. Most of student study more than 3 years(high school period) for the test. I think this situation is harmful for students. There is some reasons why I feel so.
  First,  I think that 'the big test' mess the student life. As I mentioned, the test is  big test for entering college so many student think the test is very important in life, including me. For that reason, a lot of high school students concentrate on studying for the test and spend almost every time for preparing the test. I think this is a big problem, because we(students) should always think about dream. (This is related with second reason.) However, the test steals our time for thinking about our dream. Some people can say ""Isn't it wishing and studying for college 'dream'?"" But it's not dream. It is short-term dream so it can be just kind of 'goal' for 'dream'. I think many students confuse their 'goal' and 'dream'. 
  Second, many students do nothing after the test. Because of situation that I mentioned in first reason. Many students confuse their 'goal' and 'dream', and think it is a dream that getting good grade at the 'big test' and entering famous college. Hence, many student don't do something for improving themselves. I'm not gonna inist that resting and relax is bad. But we always need to improve ourselves, and many students stop that after the 'big test'. Because t

 Second, we can save  money because of the weather. We have to buy cloth for 4seasons. And air conditioners and heaters are expensive. When only 2seasons left, we can save lots of money. 
 You can simply think that the workplace which is related to summer or winter will be decrease. And the usage of money will dcrease. So the economy wil be shrink.

"I think the age limit of drinking alcohol should be change in Korea.  So if I can change one important thing about my country, I will lower the age limit. In other countries, high school age can drink alcohol.  Also Koreans have negative site for alcohol. I think this things affect a lot  in difference of country cultures.  And I think alcohol culture of Korea is not really good and should be change. That's why I want to lower the age limit and I will talk about some specific reasons for my idea. 
 First, by drinking alcohol, we can make a lot of friends. Actually alcohol can make exciting  atmosphere and I think that only alcohol can make it.  Shy students can't make friends easily, but they can get closer to friends with alcohol. Moreover, alcohol helps us to talk honestly and talk something which is difficult to talk in daily life. This helps us to see a person more deeply and it makes closer with that person. Next, alcohol can get rid of stresses. Korean students have a big stress in studying. When the stress grows it can easily change into violence. It is really bad environment for students, but it is current situation in Korea. I think alcohol can lower the stress. When we drink alcohol, we became happier and no-brain. It sounds not really good. But Korean students need some no-brain times for a rest. With some no-brain times and communication we can lower the stress and be delightful. Last, little bit of alcohol can increase study ability. With a little bit of alcohol, we can relax and concentrate to study. Some students who can't concentrate well and think a lot of thingwhich is not associated with study can clean the brain and focus.
 By those reasons, if I could change one important thing about our country, I will lower the age limit of drinking alcohol. If I can really change this I believe that students will be happier."	3	3.5	3	9.5

"I will change the high schools of our country, if I can do. In my country, Korea, the students in high school are suffered from so many things. They are suffered by studing, they are suffered by The-big-test-for-university, they are suffered by their grads. So, compare with my experence, I will tell you why this is big problem and this must have to change.
First of all, the grading of high school must be changed. Most of high school in Korea, the the grading way is comparison--grading. It means that, if there's someone who do better on the test, than you never get better grades than that. If you want to get good grades under the comparison-grading system, than you have to make your best job and otheres have to perform wores than that. This give too much stress to high school students. In the same class and same school, they are all friends but they have to fight each otheres and wish to get a worse grades than each otheres. I thing this is very heacy stress for young students and it makes hard to study something in high school.
For the second reason why the high school must be changed is, The-big-test-for-university. In Korea, there's a big test called 'Suneung' which determind the university. And for that, students study very hard so they get good grades on the Suneung and go to the university where they want. The system 'Suneung' is also the problem but the bigger problem is, the high school in Korea teach only about Suneung. I think, there must exist some students that don't want to take Suneung and dont't want to go to the university. Instead of that, they may want to do othere thing in future and learn other things in high school. But almost all the high school in Korea, they ignore this opinion and force to study about Suneung. And this becames a very big stress to the students who have different idea and opinion.
I was in high school too, and thanks to my abnormal high school, my high school leave us to study whatever we want to. But it is just special case for me, I have many friends that studied only boring things that they didn't want to in normal high school. So, I heard directely about the suffers from high school by my friends, and I know they suffered from comparison--grading in highschool, and big test Suneung. So, to save these students from the stress, I want to change the system of high school in Korea."	3.5	3.5	3	10

Then I will change essential military regulation into optional without double check, which this essay insists with these following reasons.  
 
 First, essential military regulation deletes precious young men's time. Nobody denies that 2 years are very long time for young guys to do something for their dream; nonetheless, most young men of Korea should give their time to country, which can give for them to feel bad since they fall behind comparing with other country's guys, Korean women, and Korean men who jump military. Even in my case, being wasted time in army is feeled like a gold, I think applying to essential policer or American military, katusa. Therefore, country should give free time for Korean young men to achieve dream.

 This is another reason that military sometimes hurts armies.  I heard that if you preserve your health in military, you have a success about your army life. I thought it  is crap at that moment, but I think again about it now, it is very good advice for army sadly. Even in the case of my cousin's friend, though he hurts his leg in the military, he could not acquire any reward about it. He gives precious his time and more precious his health. Thus, country is demaging many Korean young men without any reason and apporpriate reward.

  In conclusion, if I can change only one important thing about our country, I will change essential military regulation into optional. This is because miliatry deletes precious Korean young men's time and sometimes hurts them without appropriate reward."	3	3	3	9

People who have studied in KAIST would have imagined KAIST in which placed Seoul at least once.  Some would argue that there are more advantages in current position of KAIST. On the other hand, others maintain that it would be better to be in capital area. I also believe that there are mor advantages when KAIST is in capital area. KAIST is important sciences institution so there will be many advantages if its position is changed to Soeul. It would help our study and increase qualities of our life. There are two reason that related in advantages of capital area.
     Most of all, that universities are placed in capital area can help their many studies. In current, there are many collaboration study with other universities. KAIST is not exception. Many professors and labs in KAIST would conducts research with other team. If research teams are in same area, efficiency of the study will be increased. The time exchanging information and sample will be decreased so people can finish their research in shorter terms.
     Another reason is that capital area can develope people's quality of life. Many freshman want to enjoy their university life. Seoul has many place where we can enjoy, see and taste. However, our KAIST is in Dajeon so many students have complaints since Dajeon is not fun city. People even said that Dajeon only has SUNGSIMDANG and there is nothing expect it. If our university is in capital area, many students are satisfied. Also, position of university would change level of it. In highschool, there are not little student who hate to entrance in KAIST because of position of KAIST.
     In conclusion, the change of position of KAIST is many advantages. It would help professors and students."	3.5	3.5	3	10

It is so variable even some people came from other country. each country has different things in culture and geological. So, many people has different view and has opinion about important one things what they want country to change So, I want to introduce just one thing  what I want country to change in following reasons. It is a bully in Korean students. My country, South korea should not have bully in student society. 

 First, For almost students, school is their biggest society. Students in Korea have to go school in everyday except weekend. For instance, if one student jiho bully other student juno, juno's society will destroy by physical and language violence of jiho. It is not fair to juno and other students.

 Second, Being Bullied cause PTSD to one or more students. If one person got bullied in neiborhood, a chance of that person to grow to mental-healty adult will decrease because he will have negative behavor for everything.

 Thesedays, many witnesses of bully disclose what happend in school about the enterteinment world.It will be goodflow for our society. So, If i could change one important thing about my coutry Korea, what I want is  disappearing of bully."	3	2.5	2.5	8
1574	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change one thing about my country, then I would change birth rate. I have three reasons why I think so.
First, the population of Korea is decreasing naturally. The birthrate of Korea is about 0.8, and this rate is too low compared with other countries. If this tendency will countinue,  all koreans may be gone someday. It is a very serious crisis, so we must solve it.
Second,the burden of a young man is getting heavier. Because of low birthrate and extended lifespan, the number of the elder compared with the young is increasing. So young people should pay more cost than before.
Third, Family relationship is highly associated with one's happiness. Nowadays, so many people choose living alone. I appreciate that living alone has many good things, but it is much happier and comfortable to make a family. 
For these reasons, I want to make birth rate of our contry high."	2.5	3	2.5	8
1575	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I think worst thing of my country is too much competing. Furthermore, reason of this phenomenon is that there are many things which universities want. So, I want to change things that universities order. These days, they make high school students write individual introduction paper 3500 letters and participate many museum and, study hard to the top while they are in school. But, this is so busy that many high school students choose dying. As we know, university students are busy but I don't think high school students don't need to be busy. So, I want to remove individual introduction paper because it is not important. If you want to estimate students, see the school life record paper not individual introduction paper. For example, KAIST pass three students who copy other people's introduction paper. Other example is DGIST. In my high school students write only 2500 letters but university order 3500 letters. However the result is pass so many students who are in my school think individual introduction paper is garbage one. To sum up, individual introduction paper is trash so I want eliminate this, and this will decrease high school students' concern."	2.5	2.5	3	8
1576	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Seoul is the most famous city in my country, South Korea. There are so many people and many high buildings in Seoul. However, other cities are not crowded and not developed as Seoul. My country is very good for me, but I want to change this one thing that many important things like huge companies, industry, and peole are all in only Seoul. I will give some reasons why I want to change this thing.
  First of all, Seoul is too crowded. Seoul is small, but there are so many people. Because of that, people can't do something freely they want to do. For example, people sometimes can't get on the bus or subway because there are already full. Also, people usually can't go to the famous restuarant or hot place. It is too hard to do something what I want to because around thousand of people are living in Seoul. 
  Secondly, it is not good that many important things for country are focused in small area. If Seoul is attacked by someone or something, our country may get very big damage because so many people and the huge companies are gathered in Seoul. I hope that my country is not attacked, but we should prepare for case. 
  Finally, my hometown is not Seoul, and I should go Seoul by taking the subway for an hour if I get some important happen.  I wish many things that are only in Seoul are also in my hometown. 
   As a result, by the three reasons, I want to disperse many things in Seoul to all around of my country. If I can change this thing, I think my country will be better for us."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

"In many African countries,  goverments are corrupt and the leaders are authoritarian.  It isn't diffrent in case of my country.   Ethiopia, is a nation of multi-ethinic groups.  Being a member of such a diverse society gives an advantage to share different cultures and atitudes  which is very beautiful. But, there are also some serious problems which are always tied to the concept of identity politics. In the past, about half  a century ago, the country was ruled by some specific ethinic group - Amahra. So this days, in the Ethiopian poltical arena,  most politicians claim that the identity and culture of many tribes was suppressed by one tribe.  The mass follows these hatred-full political figures and now the country is divided. The division among the people has put its negative impact on the economy of the country and it is beleived that the nation might be at the brink of civil war. 
Most of the accusations have no clear evidence and it is very likely that they might even be fabiricated stories.  The activists and the political party leaders are encourging and preaching violence by using various social media platforms. The majority of thier followers lack knowledge of usage of social medias and they are emotion-driven.  So, it would be great to ban such social medias in the country if they can't control thier users.  "	2.5	2.5	3.5	8.5

 Here are my opinions about military system.
 First, people has different knowledge, physical, ability. So if every person must have same roll, it is the inefficient way itself.
 Second, ourdays war will be scientific war. Then soldier's number  is not most import thing.
 Third, 18 months are very very long.
 So I want to change the military system's time 18 months to 6 months.
 But we have system about spare soldiers in 5 years.
 If we increase spare soldiers system time 5 years to 6 years. Soldier number in war will not decrease."	2.5	3	2	7.5
1579	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" If I can change the importatnt thing about my country it will be definitely the military duty. I think the military duty should be disappear for 3 reasons.
 First, nowadays, the tendency of war has changed. We just use the long-distance weapons, which are very powerfull and don't needed lots of soldiers to utilize it. This means we can fight with enemy with less number of soldiers. For example, when I was in the artillery only 5 to 6 soldiers needed to manage the one self-propelled gun. Compared with infantry company, number of people in one company are about 1/6. It shows us that we need less soldiers while our military technologies are developing.
 Also, it is too harsh to young man to spend about 18 month in military. Time is very precious to everyone. Although, we can do lots of things such as study, use self-phone ect. compared with the past. But, it is still very difficult to have their own time while they are in military. In my cases, I have to enter the office anytime when my bosses call me and ask to do something. Even though I was sleeping.
 Finally, the problem is because soldiers were not volunteered,  the efficiency of the soldiers working are not as good as their best performance. It is true someone have to protect our country. But it is not fair that soldiers work for the country only with the small money, under the 1million won. It is increasing, but still not enough to cheer up soldiers morale.
  So if I have chance to change something in my country, I will change military duty into volunteer, and give more money as much as public officials. It will approve the national defense power. "	4.5	4	3.5	12

"If I can change the on important thing in korea, I would change the working envirnoment. There are the 2 reasons for why I want to change working envirnoment.
First, Korea workers work the longest time in the world. Many workers are hard for their work. They don’t have time to take a rest. I think that long time work doesn’t make the good result. If reduce the working time it make better result than before. 

Second, worker work for making money. If the workers have family they can’t quit it easily. Some time bully in company or too hard work make lot of stress. It can some time cause sucide. More comfortable working envirnoment will reduce bad way and less hard for their wok. Also more comfortable envirnoment upgrade the people’s happyness.

Better result and make happyness is the reson why I would want to change the working envinoment"	2.5	3.5	3	9

For now, we are using a lot of  money for them living in the prison. but if death penalty exists, we don't have to use money for them. but there are many problems. It can be misjudged, so person who didn't commit a crime can be dead by death penalty. we have to judge for death penalty when crime has certain evidence. we have to imprison people who don't have certain evidence. Thanks to death penalty, we can use rest of the budget for other poor people. Also, we can isolate them from society forever.  these are my reasons that we have to return death penalty."	2	2	3	7

" I want to change the forbidding to meet more than 5 people outside. This rule may be efficient to prevent spreading COVID-19, but this also can make people get depressed and make health worse. Because of the rule of forbidding, people cannot play hobby like basketball or soccer. Korean students and workers have very busy and tired days. Many of them usually make stress out with playing soccer or basketball in the club, and also this can help to make healthier. Everyone will know the importance of exercising. But now they can't meet over 5 people so they can't play sports. This situation can lead to lower activities and worse health. Of course, someone will say like ""You can exercise alone. What;s the matter?"", it is right but usually exercising together is more funny than exercising alone, so exercising together can help people to motivate for fun. That's why forbidding to meet more than 5 people can make people's health worse. Loss of activities leads to increase of depression. Activities have benefits not only for health but also make people feel better and relaxed. So this rule make many people depressed.
 In the case of me, I also feel depressed sometimes because I can't play basketball or soccer with my friends. My friends also think they feel depressed like me because of the same reasons.
 I know that this is for preventing to spread viruses, but at least, correspond to outside, that place is not dangerous as much as inside. Also wearing mask can be more safer around sixty times than not wearing mask, so if we comply to wear masks, it will be okay to exercise together.

1583	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"One important thing which seriously affects us is studying same thing. 
As korean students, parents and teachers force us to study more, encouraging not to play and enjoy our own life. 
We don't know academic thing at 7~8 years, but we must study mathematics, korean, and even foreign at elementary school.
In such situation, we started to study same thing during 9 years.
Because entering elementary school, and middle school is necessary course in korean, we learn SAME thing without one's talent or interest.
I think this part has serious problem, making us chase one point like having nice business or going to great university.
If we don't stick to such studying law, i can strongly say that our country will develope. 
There aren't same people. All people have different talent, want to know different thing. 
So, we try to give a new studying course for new generations. 
I think we must give them to choice interesting part for 9 years (even game, gamble, traveling... and etc).
By checking their interesting part(although they felt bad after really doing it), they will seek their own road.
Like this, i hope to see various students enjoy their life probing themselves."	2	1	3	6
1584	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I can change something in our country, I'd like to modify education system. There are several things that I think that sould be changed. most of all, our education system is not made for thinking, but just learning. In my opinion, the reason why we learn is to make our own comprehensive problem solving method. and to do this, it's important to make a proper atmosphere, which the students can think their own way. but I'm not saying that just let them thinking with no regulation is good. definitely we have to set some kind of formulated route to lead students right way. but in our society, the route, which has been composed and modified for several decades, doesn't emphasize the importance of thinking, and push students to memorize imformation as much as possible. and there no way to use these kinds of knowledge properly, because thinking strategy is not yet constructed. so, it's essential to develop thinking strategy while learning things. and one of the good method is make students have continueous curiosity and teachers help to think it with various kinds of way.
In short, current education system, which have to be changed, doesn't promote active thinking, and it could make students lower their problem solving abilities."	3	3.5	4	10.5
1585	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" These days, many of students, exactly parents are interested in education of  their daughter and son. This phenomenon is not bad but the problem is this is really serious. Excessive passion of the education of parents made a wierd education system of Korea. So if it is possible, I will change the education system of my country for some reason.
 The first reason is about money. One of the wierd education system that I think is huge academy system, calld Hakwon in Korean. Most of the students go to Hakwon. I thaught about the reason why every students go to Hakwon. Students wanted to go and study more? Maybe some of them will have that purpose, but I don't think that is the normal reason. Students go to Hakwon because other students and their friends go to Hakwon. By studying in Hakwon, their friends improve their ability  of many subject, and parents want their childs get a good score. So, eventually, every students go to Hakwon. But how about poor children and students? It they don't have enough money to register Hakwon, they can't go there and their score naturally get low. Because of money, the knowledge distance between the childern who has rich parents and poor parents are becoming farther and farther. The test and exam should be the measurement of the student's attitude in class and achievement of the subject, but it started to involve the competition of hakwon, and this is the point. 
 The second reason is the concern about students' self learning  skills. I also went to Hakwon when I was teenager. When we go Hakwon, teachers in Hakwon do lecture and give homework, and this repeats all day and all week. Also teachers answer all of the question. If students  get use to this pattern and just do what teacher said except thinking, they will lose self learning skills. They could lose how to study by themselves because teacher did everything, and this will become really serious after they graduate highschool and go to collage or university. After the graduation of the highschool, they should plan and make their future by themselves, So self learning skiil is really important, and Hakwon is bothering students getting these skills.
 The last reason is that the importance of the school is becoming lower. Usually, Hakwon lectures are difficult than school lecture because students learn the higher level of the subject in Hakwon. So students naturally ignore and don't pay attention to the lecture in school, in bad case, also ignore teachers.
 By these three reason, I want to change the education system of my country."	4.5	3.5	3	11

"I think the most important thing of our country is make baby enough to maintain people who can work. The baby number per  woman who can get baby is 0.84 now. This is very big problem. we should remember the woman who can get baby also decreased, so the baby number decrease very strongly.  in 50years the old people(who can't work) will be bigger than who can work. It means the country gonna be broken. We need the solutions, but this is very hard problems for our country. the best way is gonna be same country with north korea. But it is very hard solution and we can't control it, so let's pass this solution. The other solution is 20s~30s should get married. But It is very hard with the economy. I am also don't like to make child because of the money. We can't get a little house in Seoul, without Lottery, stocks or something. 20s~30s best scenario is just get a job and get 1,000,000 won~2,000,000 won, and live a very little house with loan. Normal 20s can't get a job, and They just need to get some money to their parents. The problems of house and jobs are connect with the baby problem. So what is the solutions? The eaisest way is loan some money to 20s with a very low extra-fee.  And we need to make some people to get out from the Seoul and Gyonggido(I don't know the right spelling.). I know without the Seoul, there are many houses who doesn't live. we need to make people live outside from Seoul. And there are another problems to the baby problem. It is gender problems. Nowadays, for 20s~40s , Mans and womans fight each other. They fight with solider problem, woman police, disconnect of working routine, etc.. When we see the internet chatting, there are too many problems of gender. goverments need to stop the fight immediately. Who can be married don't like each others? Of course, it is very very hard.  In conclusion, to solve the baby problems, we need to solve the house problems, job problems and gender problems. These are very hard to solve but There are no answer for these problems. Of course we can solve these problems with very special law like all people should married or something like that. But this is impossible to the democracy country. In conclusion, we need to make 20s~40s can get jobs and houses. and reduce the gender problems. In total of 3 should be solve to solve the baby problem."	2.5	1.5	2.5	6.5

And also it is very sad that Korea is one of the few divided countries. I'm not saying to blame foreign dominant countries.
I think it is wrong to express anger toward foreign(Japan, China etc.) throughout history today. We should learn fault, not anger from history.

Nevertheless I don't know much about history, I think that enlightenment in East is slower than that of the West.
It is regrettable that even though there were many great scholars in Korea, could not contribute to modern science because engineering was ignored to Seonbi
If our country had not considered to be loyal to China and had not ignore the opening of Japan's ports, our country would have been able to concentrate more on learning.
Then maybe the Korean science can be developed a little faster, so I wish to change history of my country."	3	3	3.5	9.5

FIrst, my country, South Korea, was devided into 2countries, NORTH and SOUTH, and still devided now on. From that, many people had hard time. It tortured people in the past and still torturing  and even our childrens will be tortured because of that memory or history.  My grandma and grandpa was involved in ""6.25 war"".  The war that was evoked in June 25th. My Grandma was the nurse and grandpa was a soldier.  When I was like 10years old, i remember nothing about things i did in age 10, but i remember one thing. The story about 6.25 war from my grandma and grandpa. It seemed like they were really scared at that time.  Everyday was like hell to them and some still feel scared. For example, when i was in high school I volunteered in a hospital. In the hospital there was a grandmother who shakes if she hears loud noise cause of the memory of grenades and bombs. Like this, people has trouma becuase of the memory in the past. Being devided has no advantage. Bad memory, horrible things. money for military, men going to the military. Everyday every second, we have to be nervouse and cautious. So I want to change the history so we could gather, North and South.

Second, my country was civilized by Japan. And my grandma was about 18years old at that time. She said that some bunch of Japan soldiers came and said they will give good foods and money so follow us. My grandma did not follow them. She said she was so lucky. Now, we know that Japan soldiers took Korean girls to use them for sexual slaves. From that one sentence she said, I could feel how scary that situation would be. Like this, many people have big trouma from that civilization such as 6.25.war.

For example, If I eat out on the weekend with my family, I should spend about 1 hour to arrive the restaurant. And it is not just for the special holiday but for the normal weekend. I think the main reason why traffic jams happen is that our city is the way to go to the seoul. It means that many people try to move on to the seoul using the road through our country. And the road is also narrow so that it is weird if there is no traffic jams.  
 In the main street, there are cross-section, and it is the most chaos section. So, I want to build a basement-road. Then, it would be much easier to pass through because there is no traffic lights so that cars do not need to stop. Secondly, I think that it would be better to change the time of traffic light of the turning left. As I experienced, there are few cars turning left. Most of cars want to go straight. So, shortening the traffic light of the turning left is good way. Finally, If they make the width of the road longer, road can take more cars. And it is the most important solution to solve problem. If traffic problem solved, It would be wonderful country to live. "	3	3	3	9

First, the culture of our country is basically really fast. Everyone lives fast and does what needs to be done quickly. You can see that people get on the subway or bus very fast. Therefore, it seems that individual's  leisure life is not properly enjoyed. secondly, there are people who think that the culture of other countries is a little better than the culture of Korea. For example, some people think that traditional clothes from other countries are more sophisticated than our hanbok. I think we need to fix these ideas. Third,  There are not many trash cans on the side of the road, so you can see a relatively dirty envionment.  There are also a lot of people who inadvertently throw trash or cigarette butts on the floor without any thinking.

And I think the individual answer will be affected by personal complain in their own life. For me, I want to change the language, Korean to English for several reasons in the view of globalization. 

 First, there are some limitation in sharing cultures. Recently, we are sharing cultures actively. For example, K-pop is getting attention all around the world these days. However it is centered groups or members who can speak English. I always think that K-pop can be more famous when we use English well. 

 Second, learning two languages requires big effort. In KAIST, we have to study with English. And I think it is necessary for our development. But our mother language is Korean, so it has difficulties with getting information in one round. We have to translate it first."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

In truth, I think people's life is important than country's life. So, I don't want to earn a lot for country. I want to use my money for my happy life. Next two sentence is about my opinion.
First, country can use money to increase people's happiness. Country's money is used in many different kind of policy like military and technology, etc. Their purpose of using are same to make happy country. So, country's money is using to make happy people. 
Second, people don't have to work a lot for country's develop. People have to pay tax to get country's service(?). If country is rich, country can decrease tax without decrease quality of policy. 
As a result, If country has a lot of money, people get money from country and don't have to work a lot for country. Then, people can use their money for their life.

There had been many changes in education these days. But I don’t think they are  good change. Because they do not change fundamental education. In many Asian countries, especially Korea, educations focus on going to university. Students study Korean, English, math, science to go to university, not for their knowledge or personal interest. Unless students are not interested in these parts, they are useless. Graduating middle school is duty in law. But high school and university is not. If someone don’t study in highschool, it is not illegal. That’s OK. But In our society, it is treated as illegal. People who dont’ go to highschool or university get penalties in many part of society. How wierd it is? Not illegal things are treated as illegal things. It is big problem. We should solve this problem. How? Changing fundamental education system! What I want to says is not a small change in some part of math, English, etc. What we need is fundamental change. 
First, in highschool, we should not push students to university. But, for many people, studying in university is not necessary. If someone wants to be a writer, reading many books,  watching movies or just think a lot can be better. For photographers, traveling around the world would be better. There are many ways to study about their job or life. University is just one way of studying, not only way of studying. So we should find many ways for students to achieve their goals.
Second, we should teach many useful knowledges for students. The world is changing faster and fater. But education is stopped. If you looke some picture of school in 1980s, you would know that school didn’t change a lot. It’s almost same! These education is too old. We should teach students how fast our society is changing. What is AI, how to use programing language, how to predict future are good examples. There are so many things to know, but these education system don’t teach them. We should change this.
Third, we should make them happy. You know that Korean suicide raking is 1st in OECD cointry. Many highschool students are not happy. They wake up early and go to school. They study and study until 10pm at school. It’s not the end. They go to study cafe to study more until midnight. They are always tested. If their grade is poor,  they blamed. They study 3 years like this way. How they could happy? But some countries, students are happy. They study what they want to learn. They do not concern with grades. They just study to upgrade themselves! It is real education. Studying a lot and go to good university is not real edution. It makes students just like studying robot. We should find a way to make students study happily. 
As we know, changing fundamental education need many efforts. I think changing education system has many conflicts. But we should do that. Students who got good education will grow up and will make better society. For future, education changing is what we really need."	3.5	4.5	2.5	10.5
1596	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  If I could change one important thing about my country, I would try to change the education program in South Korea. Since I have lived here for 20 years, I had lots of points that I regret because of the education program. Especially, I want to change the age when we have to go to highschool or college. There are two reasons why I think we should have spare time before going to highschool or college.
  First, the age 16-19 is an important age to choose what we want to do. Usually, most of students' puberty ends when they are 16. During the middle school, students' opinions can easily change because of sources from outside. Age 16-19 is a time when they can think what they really want to do. If students go to highschool rightaway, there are less time to think about their dreams. In normal highschool, studying is usual and there are less chances to experience about their future dreams. Also, after students go to special highschools such as Arts Highschool or Science Highschool, there are lots of students who move their schools because they don't fit in. This can be a huge loss of time. So, it is better to give students chances to seriously think about their future dreams before going to highschool.
  Second, there can be students who need to earn money for their future schools. There are tragic cases which some students can't go to higher level schools even though they have great abilities because money. If there is spare time before students go to highschools or colleges, they can earn money themselves, and they can concentrate to things what they want to learn in highschools or colleges. I think this spare time can be a important time for students to change their future.
  There are lots of students who have hard time finding their future dreams because they didn't have enough time. Also, there are some cases which great students couldn't get a chance to learn because of less time and money. I think this spare time in the education program can be a chance to change some students' future. All of the students should have enough chance to learn or find their future."	3.5	4	3	10.5
1597	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  I want to change education system in my country, Korea. Few years ago, I was under in high school in Korea. I felt there are so many unnecessary things in education course. In my opinion, student should choose subjects like university. There are several reasons why I want to change education system.
  First, There are too many subjects.  When student in middle school, student learn fundermental things. however, student learn specific things in high school.  Threre are some disadvantage. For example, some student don't want to learn math. Because, they don't need too specific mathmetical knowleage and mathmetical idea. If student can choose subject, this student may not learn math, and learn more useful subject for them.
  Second, student can learn deeper. For example, math education course 's volume in high school is decreaing  becase of class time issue. If student can choose subject, student who want to learn math may choose many math courses, and they can learn deeper. Korea's math course teach too finite area. It is also in other high school education couse.
 Third,  It can decrease competition. Nowdays, knowleage is not important. For example, In economic class in high school, economic knowleage is not important. That is only memorized text need for test score. Most of student don't have any interest in meaing of text. If student can choose subject, diversity of subject will increase. So, student can focus on their interesting subject. In my opnion, student may feel less stress becasue that subject is not only for competiton.
  For these reasons, if I could change one important thing about my country, I would change education system. It can make Korea students happy and fun high school."	3	3.5	3	9.5
1598	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"if i could change one thing in our country, i want to change the education system of our country.
there are two reasons.
first reason is that now education system make students compete together. this problem makes students 비교하다 each other and makes the stress.
so, many students feels sad because of their grade and some students do the dangerous things.
second, this system is not efficient. it just make students know many information and do well in test. so, this many information is not easy to use in daily life. and this system does not teach important things like leadership, teamwork and creativity.
finally, this system only likes academic things. for example, in middle school, students have to learn math, korea and science for 5 hours in a week. but not academic things like art and music is teached only one or two hours in week. and stuents have no choice about that. if they want to learn about art more, school doesn't do that. so in these area, only the person try to learn it because system doesn't help.
for these reasons, i wnat to change now education system edcation system that is more usefull and free and makes studensts happy."	3	3	2.5	8.5
1599	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  Nowadays, we separate to 2 countries, the north korea and south korea. If i could change one important thing, i will unify them. There are several reasons.
     First, there are many families who can't meet each other because of separation. I can't imagine how they are painful. But, at least, i'm sure that it is one of the most painful things. Because the separation isn't their fault, they have the right that meet their family who are loved by each other more than everything on earth. 

    Second,  there are pros and cons if we unify north korea and south korea. Unifying them will solve a lot of problems . But, it costs a lot. Really a lot. It can be the reason why people hesitate when someone ask them ""Do you want current governments unify two separate korea?"". To unify them, some generations carry the problems.  So, if i could make them as a country which had never separated, no one suffered because of it.

    Last, we are using so many sources as army, money, time to make tense between north and south korea. I think it is totally useless. Of course, because we come a long different way and build very different two culture and governments, it is hard to live as one country. That's why we are wasting our valueable sources. But we should try not to waste our sources, and we know that we need to try. And it's difficult. So if we could make north korea and south korea as one that had never separated, no longer need to waste our sources and be painful because we know we should try harder difficult ways, but it's not sufficient .

    Because of these reasons, for me, unifying two different korea is the first task if i could change one important thing."	2.5	3.5	3	9
1600	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If i could change one important thing., I would change the cold war with north korea.
We spend 3 billion dollars for army every year, and it's more than quarter of total sepnding.
The reason why we spend numureos money is we have kept maintain negative position with north korea.
So we can use money more widely following to the end of the cold war.
Also, korean man have to use their time at duty for the army.
18 months is very long time and most of them go to army at 21~22. It's very important time for everyone.
Most people study for their future or get some refresh. But soldiers can't. Also there is no fair reward for them.
For thsese reasons, I want to change the relationship with north korea."	3	3	2.5	8.5
1601	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   If I can change one thing in Korea, I would change the education system.  Compared to USA or other countries, Korea's education system is too strict and unhelpful. Korea's education system is loosing purpose. I will give you three reasons why and how Korea's education system should be changed.

    First, the SAT system should be changed.To get good score in SAT, Korean students should be act like ""machine"".  The subject of SAT is limited, and similar questions are given every year. It might be looks fair, but it means lots of private eduaction and money are effecient for students. 



   Second, money and private education is wasting young student.  For examle, in Dachi-dong, there are a lot of elementary students studying high-school math.   Because of parents' force, young students can't enjoy their life and they are just studying at academy. I think it is bad becauseother activities like sports, art or experiences are a lot more important than studying math, especially in young age. Then, how this can be changed? First, changing perceptions of Koreans is important. Koreans think student who get good score in math test is good student, and going good unoversity is the most important thing in life. We have to change these thinking. 
    And then, Korea should provide good public education. Not only subject like math, english, or others, government should give student to think about their future. One way is making more job high schools. Even though there are schools like art high school, or fashion, cooking schools, they are not active now. We should increas the number of them and give more diverse choices."	3	3	3	9
1602	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I want to change education policy in Korea.
In Korea students fight with each other unneccesarily, since they are young  and they think other students as rival. They study hard and fast in order to enter good high school(science high school or school  knowned for good score), and good university. In my experience, I take the high school's normative course but also additional class and contest is needed.
And students(including me) are accoustomed to scoring themselves 1 to 9 grade or A,B,C... . I think such situation is so sad because they learn the way to know their limit after disappointment, although this limit is not their limit actually. Grading with number for student's ability kill their will, courage, potential and dream. So I think education policy should be free and personal, not encouraging rival. For such policy, We give many many opportunity to young children to seek something that they interest, like, can do well. Now, society tell them 'You should  Korean, mathematics, English, biology, physics, chemistry ...' And if they find their 'flame' parents or teacher encourage children's flame to be bigger. this time, if parents or teacher cannot support their dream, government should support. government should plan and accomplish support program for unaided children.
Of course, existance of rival is sometimes needed in same field. it may stimulate individual's motivation. But we compel everyone must study same thing now, the result is overhitting competence. So, I think we can reduce unnecessary competence by supporting personal and free education."	2	2	2.5	6.5
1603	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I always think many of problems in South Korea is from hierarchical order or confucian culture. So, I want to change the cause of this culture. For example, we can easily to contact with news about someone do ‘갑질’ from their money, power in society, or age. These news always cause many people’s furious and relative deprivation. Additionaly, news that recently hot about school violence are also in this problem that appear in not only adult’s world, but also in teenager’s school. Obviously, this problems is not only for our country. There are a lot of countries who moan for them. However, I have some details about ‘why these problems more severe in our country’.
Korean have two different type of words called by exaltation and ordinary word. In Korean, ‘높임말’, ‘예사말’. When we use exaltaion in some situation, obviously you recognize that the other person is higher than you. Contrary says, when you use ordinary words, abviously you recognize that the other people is lower or equivalent with you also. And this cause the problem. Otherwsie, when someone recognize the other people is lower than him or her, more likely to behave worse. 
Conclusion: Korean language help to recognize the other person’s level(사람에 level은 없지만 마땅한 표현이 떠오르지 않습니다...), and that cause more worse behave like ‘갑질’.
To add, our confucian culture from Chosun – 가부장적, 노인공경 등. Also add this problem more bigger. I think I don’t have to write more details for this. It’s hard to explain in word, and all of we know about it.
In conclusion, I want to change the language – 높임말, and some of history that ignore inferior."	2	2	3	7
1604	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I think we need to improve the politic system. These days, 'Deobul-eo Minjudang' has more than 70% of the whole seats. I'm not sure that's the right reason, but I can't help thinking they make and discard the laws easily even if it is really unefficient. That means the laws can't work well.
 For example, we can use electric kickboard without any license because the rate of car accident is increasing. It doesn't make any sense. In my opinion, it's natural to set the limit higher in order not the raise the rate fo accident. If politicians made this law carefully, they could easily catch that it is wrong way to fix the problem.
 So I want to fix today's system by limiting the rate of seats for each politician groups lower than 50%. Than other groups can defense bad laws to pass when one group wants."	2.5	2.5	3	8
1605	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  I am always tired. I usually take a sleep for 8~9 hours but I want to sleep again and again, so if I could change one important thing about my country, it would make a napping time. In some countries, there are napping time called ciesta(?). It is on 1 ~2pm after the lunch. Then I will give some specific reasons and details why I want to make a napping time.

  First, people can get energy through this napping time. These days, many people get tired because of their works. Especially, my country, Korea, there are many people who works a lot. They usually get up at 7am and work or study about 12~13 hours. Working hard for their life, goals, money or reputation is good but I want to get relaxing time. After lunch, people are sleepy because of lunch. Through this napping time people will get energy, then their work efficiency will grow. It will be good cycle. 
 Second, taking a nap is good for their health. Many students in my country, they study over the midnight, especially test weeks. For their body and mental, taking a nap is one of the best way that can prevent getting disease. 
  Last, my country will be full of happiness. When people are tired, they easily get angry. Getting stress is one of the biggest reason why people argue each other or fight each other. Napping time will bring relax in their mind and decrease their stress. If my country has napping time, people get relaxed. Then, decreasing argument, fight and criminal. My country will be full of smile.

In my opinion, I would make a napping time with those 3 reasons if I could change one important thing about my country."	3	4	3	10
1606	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Not a thing can regulate a country. Neither a system can.  But I strongly believe a small change in a small part of the country can have an enormous impact on itself. Moreover, if the thing that changes is related to some serious problems, then the effect  would be beyond our imagination.
 For these reasons it is very hard to pick only 'one' thing to change as we cannot simulate the sequences it might occur. So first, I'll start by setting up the goal of the change. If the goal doesn't need to be our welfare, or something good, I would change our 'language'.  Not on a bad purpose, it it just to satisfy my pure curiosuty. Then to what? to English. For sure I agree that having our own mother language is way better than borrowing other's language(or alphabet) to write and express our thinking. But I would try it anyway. Not only the way of writing, the language we speak too. Imagine, from now on, we should speak, write in English and alphabet, instead of Korean and Hangul. We can simply imagine the consequence about international problems, such like 'We don't need to bring interpreter to visit another countries!', or books abroad don't need to be interpreted as well. Then what about inside the border of our country? Childrens don't need to study Hanja(I don't know the correct expression in English) to read books and to learn more about vocabulary, and we won't have any problems reading and using newly coincided words, as they usually include English expressions. In addition, in the world that Korea uses English for its national language, I won't be writing this essay for pre-test, as there will be no English class in universities anymore.
 Yet there's large amount of disadvantages as well. The disadvantages would be much more than the advantages we have by using English. Well, to be concrete, they are not disadvantages but the lost of enormous advantages we can get by having our own language. Could we have this kind of humanity as Korean without our language? Never we would and never we could get it by using international language as our language. Imagining the consequences by changing language is not an easy one but it really stimulates my curiosity."	2	2.5	3.5	8
1607	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."

1608	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"One thing I want to change in my country, Republic of Korea, is education system. It’s well-known that most people in Korea are sensitive with education and whole kind of school. Furthermore, there are still many discrimination with what school he or she graduated. “in Seoul” shows that discrimination well. I will give two reasons why education in Korea has to be changed.
First, we don’t need traditional education anymore. Last few years, Artificial Inteligence (AI) developed rapidly and it is changing world. It looks neaerly impossible to find things that don’t use AI. Therefore, world needs AI experts more and more. Even who don’t actually develop AI should be familiar with AI. That is thesedays trend. However, traditional education can’t make students AI friendly and we don’t need simple memorizing and calculating anymore. AI, computer, and internet do much faster and accurately. Hence, we need a new paradigm of education, but Korea’s education system is not changing fastly and properly. It should be changed fastly
Second, we spend too much resource for education especially from elementary school to university, the whole school life.  How surprise most people in Korea experienced “Night Study in School (야자)” and after school academy. All of Korean are mad at going to university or make their child to go university. That made huge private education market and most people use it. I don’t care if private education was not for university and something like for students' variety experice. I don’t care if people spend small amount of money that they could handle. However, it looks only for university and many families I have seen spend too much. We should stop running with closing our eyes. We should make better life for students and spend resource for much meaningful things like outdoor activitites, voluteer, and reading books.
I proposed two reasons why the education system in Korea is wrong and why I want to change. I hope much better country by changing education system in Korea. If education system changed first, it may be solve our problems naturally we face thesedays like lack of children and ""Republic of Seoul” problem.

1609	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" There is a 'Grouping Culture' in Korea. It is an old cultue that belongs from Korean tradition of harvesting rice. However, people especially students tend to make groups in schools too much and this is becoming a problem nowadays. There are tow reasons why I think the 'Grouping Culture' in Korea should change.
 First, too much grouping can lead to peer problems in school. For example, one who didn't included in any group can naturally be excepted from the whole class and be alone. Students should not avoid of hate another students just becuase they're in different groups.
 Second, too much grouping block the various way of thinking. People tend to follow the opinion of groupd which they're in even if one's opinion in defferent fron that.
 'Grouping Culture' makes people help each other and makes people feel friendly to other people but too much grouping can lead to several problems. To reduce today's bad issues caused by too much grouping, Korean 'Grouping Culture' should be changed."	2.5	4	2.5	9
1610	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I want to change the education policy, espacially for the highschool in my homeland, Korea. I choose education bacause it's about how to shape a nation's future.
 Why education is so important? Because it's the most effective way for poor peaple to get rich, or at least earn enaough money to live as a human being. To succeed as a artist, athelets, actor, ect. are far more difficult than most people may think. Education is the easest way to get success, so It's sort of widest ladder put on the society to go up. But nowadays this ladder becomes narrower and bent, so I want to change some points.
 First problem is the purpose of evaluation. Basically evaluation aims the enhencement of students' performance, but now evaluation is the most important aim of the education: who follow the class well, and who do not. This problem is especially extreme in the high school because of the second problem.
 Second problem is, now high school's largest roll is a gateway to go to the universities. I graduate Science high school, which is built for the science education of tallented students with not disturbed by the university admission test. But when was in there, whole school always focus only on the university. I guess other schools would be severe.
 And the effect of Second problem, students (especially in high school) takes so many lessons. In my high school, most of my friends take at least 3 lessons and  quite proportion takes more than 5 or 6. So they don't concentrate on the school class, because they already know! It makes the school class faster(because everybody knows) and students more concentrate on the lessons.
 By the 3 reasons above, I want to change the edu."	2.5	2.5	3	8

Second, If anyone use bad cheating, we can report them now. Through this,  it can reduce polices' tasks, because polices find them easily through real name. But it may get rid  of people's cheating.

First, Korean's punishment is not enough. In these days, many people anonyed about people who do criminal get just light judge.
I think it is wrong, too. For example, the person who do sexual violence takes punishment only few of years and live comfortably, but
victim doesn't.

Second, Korean's law has many holes. Smart people can use these holes. They can do anything by using these holes. We can see a lot of examples in Korean
movie. They just do criminal openly, and disappear quietly. And only people who don't have knowledge get judge.

For these two reasons, if I can change one important thing about your country, I will change law."	2.5	3	2.5	8

I'm not underevaluating people's effort to have a job like that, but what I want to say is so many people have this thought and I don't want they have likt that. I will show you why I want to do.
First, looking down some kinds of job is just ignoring people who have worked on that. I found the article which treated some argument between academia lecturer and food delivery worker. That lecture have disrespectful view of them, and so, she mocked the guy and this was the reason of argument. Surely, there is some bad people who work on what we call bad work, but I believe humans should not be degraded by what they are working because work has nothing to do with their attitude or personality.
Second one is about kind of wish. These days, some parents told their child that 'you have to study  hard if you don't want to do bad job.'  The youngesters who have learned that statement will not want to do that bad work. But I believe society and the member of society need those work, and human who do that work now and even at the future. If all people hesitate to do that work, society lose one work which is necessary for remaining well. 
In conclusion, I believe there should not be any recognition of job anymore among people in our country because of the two reason I have explained. And I wish the reality come true where all human get respect whatever they are working on."	2.5	3.5	3	9

Thesedays, due to the COVID-19, many people stop to go out to keep their health. So, people make more trash than before COVID-19 and many country suffer from handling the amount of trash . Our country is not expect of this problem. A lot of people use deilverly serves at home and the serves make plastic trash. Plastics is cheap, easy to make and easy to form a structure. But, it is not necessary to follow the disadvantage that pollute the enviroment. The time that plastic discompose to nature state is more than 1000-years. Therefore, many country burn the plastic trashs. If plastic burns, the carbon dioxide which make global warming is release in the air.
The worst effect of plastic is attack ocean enviroment. Some plastic products flow in to the ocean and they decompose until micro size. If plastic be a micro size, we call that micro plastic. Micro plastics are looks food of small ocean speices therefore many speices eat micro plastics than real foods. And big ocean speices catch the small speices which involved micro plastic.  At last, people eat big ocean speices with plastics and it make diease in our body.
From these reason, I argue that people stop using the plastic products."	2.5	3	2.5	8

The new-born puppies send to puppy shop and wait for the familiy. If puppies getting old so they cannot choosen for people, they should comeback to dog factory and have to live miserable life.
First, the dog factory is not clean enough to live. Dogs have to live in very small cage that almost newspaper size. Most of the owner of the factory don't cleaned dog's poop or their cage. And this is really toxic to living creature.

1616	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If i can change one thing about my country,  I want to make a takoyaki store.
   
       the first reason why i want to make takoyaki store is because I like takoyaki.
takoyaki is a food that made of flour and octopus, cabage,etc.  And Its shape is simillar to sphere.
I like takoyaki because of its sweet and salty taste and the hot temperature of it. when I eat takoyaki, thoes thing makes me feel alive.

       the second reason is that takoyaki usually  selled on food truck vender. 
And most of food truck in korea have some sanitary issue. For example, I found aluminum foil in the takoyaki which I bought at the food truck.
I think if takoyaki store made, the sanitary problem will be solved and the taste of takoyaki be more stable.



This is why I want to make a takoyaki store on my country. thank you."	2	2.5	3	7.5
1617	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  I had studied hard and have enrolled KAIST eventually. However, if I'm asked whether I'm satisfied, then I'll answer it isn't, due to the stress of studying during the school life.  If I could change only one thing about Korea,  I'd like to reduce study stress for students. There are several problems with hard competition.
 First, Students can't sleep well because of the stressful sleep-less life pattern. 2 years ago, I slept only 6 hours everyday for later tests as other friends do. Although the studying life was ended, I'm nervous yet when I go to bed to sleep, probably in order to wake up early. They would be tired and angry about all things just because they didn't sleep well.
In addition, it's easy to see friends not to the 'real friends', but 'competing rivals'. Universities bring each of them in the order of their grades, so it's not possible for professors to take students without comparing the grades from their schools. Then students should compete each other to enter the wanted university, and the stress makes them see friends the steps of the stair during competition.
 In some aspects, the situation that the way to live a good life may turn into the opposite way might be ironic. I hope students to decide what the better life is and find ways to reduce study stress."	3	3	3	9
1618	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"this is a really important topic especially right now. If I could change something in my country I would try to eliminate racisim. it might be impossible but we really need it. people are dying every day, womens are being raped, the civil war that was in my region was because of racisim and it leads to starvation, many properties and the wealth of the country has destroyed, and many working people  have died during the war. it hurts so much. 

so if i had the power to change one thing in my country i would ofcourse finish the feeling of being racist from the people. I just can not imagine how we would look like if no one was racisit, we have every natural resourses, we have more than enough population like in the working age, we have not been colonized, there was times in which we were the biggest and rich country in the very past ages during our ancestors time but now we are the poorest country in the world, we failed to protect the country that we have been given by the blood of our parents, we prefered to eat each others, we prefere to divide insteade of making a better history of our generation we prefere to lose what we have get. and that is so sad. 

BTW, I am from Ethiopia. i just can not express how bad the situation is now in our country. I do not know when we might be stable again. but yeah that's it I want to eliminate racisim from its corner stone eventhough it is impossible. because it become the worest pandemic ever. even worest than COVID19

1619	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    If I could change one important thing about our country, I will change the army system. Now, our country, south korea has not good army system. Adult man of south korea has duty to go military during two years. I think It is bad to people who should go military. Because there are  three reasons that time is too long, you can get injury, and there are no reward.
    First, Two years is terribly long time to go military. If you have two years, what would you like to do? You can enjoy game with your friends, travel to other country, and you can study anything a lot. However, Due to the fact that you are a man in south korea, You lost that time. How sad news for people. When you go military, you should might have face that have give up motions.
    Second, You can be injured in the military. Your body and heart is important.  In my opinion, our country doesn't give reward when you have injury in military. There are hard and terrible training that can cause injury. It your leader is angry, He can strike you, hit your body. In this situation, you can be injured your part of body. with no reward. In addition, We saw some news that some army were dead because of gun. during the shooting training, If there are some mistakes and the bullet go to anyone, He will get extremly injury.
    Third, Country does not give enough reward to leave in military. In korea, Army get some pay but I think it iis too little. If your owner give you 10 dollars and you should work every day, You will work? I think you might run away. People in millitary train and run everyday for country,  bur  food of military is not tasty, and pay is too small. I think this duty that we should go military should be changed. 
    For these three reasons, If I could change one important thing about our country, this duty  to go millitaty  should be changed. I think country should change millitary systen from duty to only for people who want to do army. Instead, the pay of army should rise. When it is possible in our country, people will have more chance to have career and enjoy their life."	3.5	4	3	10.5
1620	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Most of Korean students feel hard to follow the education. Have you ever thought about the reason? There are many other education systems on the various countries. If we look at those carefully, we can find some problems and lack of Korean education. If I could change one important thing about our country, I would like to change the education system like North European one. There are some reasons about  rest time, private education and test.

First, rest time is really lack in Korean education system. Taking enough rest is really important to study. Learning something makes brain tired so we need to let it rest enough, but in Korean, students are so busy to learn so many things. In other countries, they give students rest time to do self-development. Doing exercise, play instruments or reading books can make themselves grow not only in study but also in life. It is really necessary in Korea.
Second, too much private education exists in Korea. In Northern Europe, students in there are smart as much as Korean students without private education. Korean public education is falling down and down. Students can't follow public education in middle or high school without private academies. Northern Europe let us know that education can be better without private education, and we have to know how it can be possible. Public education must be stronger than now.
Third, Korean method to test students is wrong. We have enterance exam for university in the end of  high school. If a score of the exam is not good, students can't go to university where they want to go. However, it is not a good system. In Germany, there are graduating exam rather than enterance exam ,so it is easy to enter the university but hard to graduate. I think Korea should do like this. Students should be able to learn what they want and in a place where they want. It is more important to test how much they learn and understand well rather than qualification to enter  the university. This system also makes students study hard and happily. 

In short, Korean education system should be changed for those reasons. If I can do that, I really want to change this system. In reality, it is hard to change the system which continues for many years. I really hope and work hard to be. "	4	4.5	3.5	12
1621	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There have been COVID-19, the virus hitting the world, that we sadly have had lots of problems with joining offline class. Now the online class replaces it very successfully, even some advantages of online class sometimes makes me prefer the online class than offline.  Time advantage is the most simple point of them. When I take the offline class, I have to go to classroom for about 15~20 minutes, coming back to my place, too. Taking online class, this time wasting disappears that I can use my time more efficiently to my hobby, studying and working.   Convenience in taking class and asking questions is also important point, which helps students to understand and concentrate to class. Before, there were rarely students asking questions, simple or easy one. But in online class, the number of asking students and questions are much more than before. I guess this situation happened because of convenience in asking questions. Also I have bad sight so I can't see the black board clearly, but I can see computer screen very clearly that concentrating to class more than before.   At last, one of the biggest world trend is global, which needs online platforms. Therefore college students should be exposed in online platform like zoom, naver band, or youtube streaming to follow or lead the world trend. This experience are going to help us to go out to world easily very much. "	3	2.5	2.5	8
1622	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"After the COVID-19 pandemic got serious, a lot of schools all over the world started online classes. People says that there are some problems during online courses, but it is true that there are also advantages of taking online courses. So, I am going to explain two reasons of advantages of online classes, especially in college. First, students can save their times. Most of under high school students' school is near from their home. But, usually college is far from home compared to high school. Also, in college, every lectures' room is different. So they have to move quite many time during a day. But, if we taking online courses, we don't have to move from home to college, college to home, also lecture room to other lecture room. Therefore, students can save their time at less a hour a day, or more. Next, it helps students to understand lecture well. This one is not only for college, but for all schools. If we misunderstand or miss some parts on offline class, we have to ask it to professor of friends after the class. However, online class is quite easy to record it. Even some class is not real-time but recorded. So, even though we missed some parts, we can replay again and again. If that part isn't that hard, we can understand by oneself. These two are the advantages of online courses that i think. Of course, there are a lot of advantages but I think these two are the most common."	3	3	3	9
1623	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Due to the COVID-19,  most of the courses are online courses. At first I had a hard time getting used to it but now i think that there are some advantages.  First, you can save your time. All of the courses are on online so you don't need to move to other buildings to listen to courses. You can do all of your work at your room. Because the scale of the college is big, it takes a lot of time to move to another room. For that time, you could study more or do your assignments.  Second, you can listen to the lecture again. It is impossible to understand everything. Because the lecture is a video, when you missed something you can go back and see. Also if there are some parts you think it's hard, you can watch that lecture again and again. You can improve you skills by online coureses  Third, you can make up your schedule. When offline courses, you can listen to the lecture only at a period. If you have another schedule at your lecture time, you need to give up one of them. Because the lecture is online, you can do your work and listen to the lecture too. It would be more efficient if you make your own plan.   These are the reasons why i think that online courses take advantage compared to offline courses."	3	3	2.5	8.5
1624	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"We should listen to the lecture online because of COVID 19. At first, many students could't deal with online materials and they complained about the online system they used first. At that time, the situation that every college changed from offline lecture to online lecture was very sudden, so there are many problems like communication problems. But more than a year later, many inconveniences have improved, and rather, many advantages are emerging compared to face-to-face classes.  First, online courses help students understand the lecture. Although real-time lectures didn't allow students record them, video lectures allows students to watch them infinitely when they want to. It is helpful to review what they learn. Also, students can concentrate on the part they lack, and they can study the parts they didn't understand in class again. Moreover, students can pause the lecture when they feel the speed of the lecture fast. Eventually, students can absorb classes without missing anything, which allows students to gain more from lectures.  Second, students save their time and money. Before taking online courses, students had to go from their house to school every day to take classes, so they spent a lot of time and transportation fee. For example, my friends always got up at 6 and took the bus for 40 minutes to go to school. But now, they can attend class anytime, anywhere with their computer. They can use time and money they save to self-develop and take a rest.  Finally, various online materials can provide rich lectures. In face-to-face classes, teachers used electronic devices alone, so there was a limit to the teaching method. But in online classes, teacher can conduct classes in various ways. In my cases, I think it was impressive to be able to communicate smoothly with the teacher using the ""Annotation"" function in ZOOM class.   Like this, online courses which may have been inconvenient at first, offer many advantages to a growing a lot of people. Although it's a class style that started with the unexpected appearance of COVID 19, I think the online class method will continue even after this situation is over, and the good influence will be even greater."	4	3	3	10
1625	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Since 2020 March, the world has changed a lot because of coronavirus. Almost every part of our lifestyle has changed. In order to stay away from each other, we started unexpected kind meetings, online meetings. Online meeting was held everywhere including works, school, interview and everyplace where human needs to meet. Now here are some advantages of online meetings and I would like to talk about online schools, especially online colleges.   The first thing that I like about doing online courses is that I don't have to move around the huge college campas. Not like high school college has a huge campus and we need to walk around in short break time to catch the next time class. While I am attending to online class, I can simply change my zoom link to move between classes. I can use break time for only resting. Next benefit of the online course is I can stay where ever I prefer. During online course semester, I can choose if I will stay in dormitory, home, hotel or any place I want to stay. I don't need to pay for dormitory and stay home. This gives me another happiness because I don't have to move my stuff every time I move in and out of the dormitory at the end of the seamester. Also, I don't need to carry heavy books, laptop to classes. For the last by doing online class professor usually takes a video and upload so we can take a look whenever we like to. By doing this I can use my time freely. I don't have to stay outside because of the empty time between classes. I can stay home and watch the lecture when I feel like doing it. I have talked about the advantages I take of doing online courses in college and I think these reasons can be shortened in one sentence. The online course gives us freedom in time and space."	3	3	2.5	8.5
1626	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are several advantages of taking online courses.  First, if it is not a real time class which is zoom, I don't have to be in the class in fixed time. This can mean that I can take more sleep if I want to. However most of the time, I complete the class earlier than the fixed time. This can make me feel more comfortable even if I can't understand the part at once. I can go back to the part and listen more carefully what professor said.   Second, I can control my schedules easily. For example, in my case I have almost all the classes in Tuesday and Thursday. After the application period finished, I thought it would be better if I can move some classes from Tuesday to Monday. And this could be possible thanks to un- real time class. For the result, this modification made me concentrate more in each classes.   Even if it is a zoom class, there are some advantages also. Although I didn't experience the offline courses, it would be hard to find where the classroom is and go there in my foot which can be terrible in summer time. In contrast, I never move my body to access to a different classroom. I just need some finger exercises. So this is really comfortable compared to the offline courses.   These are three advantages of taking online courses. I can admit that I am more comfortable than the offline courses, but to participate hard in the classes and communicate each other I hope to start offline courses in college.   "	3.5	3.5	3	10
1627	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Due to the COVID-19, many schools including colleges are having online courses to prevent the disease. Since this was a quite rare experience, many students were able to know some advantages of taking online courses. In my opinion, the advantages of taking online courses are that we have opportunities of better understanding of the courses and also we are able to save time and energy. First advantage I thought was that having online courses provided us the opportunities of better understanding of the courses. This can be in many ways. First, until today, we had to go to the classroom in the right time. However, since the time we take the course became comparatively flexible, we could take the courses whenever our thoughts are clear, rather than listening to the lecture from the early morning with not-awakened brain. Second, since many of the lectures are done through the online video, it became much more easier to take time to have note-taking, or think again about the stuffs that we are struggling with. Last, although it may be similar to the second reason, it became easier to search about things that we don't know quickly through the Internet, since the lectures are online. Second advantage is that we can save time and energy. In school, we have to move the classes frequently to take the different classes. Especially for the college, many classrooms are in different buildings, which takes so much time. This is not only linked to the time problem, but also to the energy problem. There is only small limited time to move between the classes, so after we move, sometimes we get too exhausted to concentrate for the next class. All these problems are not going to happen through the online courses, so isn't it beneficial to have online courses that will save your time and also the energy to study? Sure, having online courses can disturb students from making a lot of new college friends, or it can also make them lazy. However, there are a lot of benefits like these from having the online courses. So, don't be so gloomy that you are not able to enjoy your campus life, but think positively that this is the chance for you to experience a lot of new things by yourself and earn the rich knowledge."	3.5	3	3.5	10
1628	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"The coronavirus is too contagious to have face to face lectures. So multiple colleges choose to have online lectures to prevent contact. When I faced this situation for the first time, it's too hard to get familiar with the system. But after a semester, I realized there are various advantages of online courses. There are about 3 reasons why. First of all, online courses make easier to ask questions in office hour. Office hour is the most important system in college. We could get some more details about the concepts that you are confused about, and we could refresh relation between professor. But in the traditional college teaching system, it's quite hard to go to the professor's office. This is the only problem that makes it hard to use office hours effectively. Nowadays, we can easily enjoy the time because what we have to do is just a click to enter the zoom!  second, the online courses let us able to study during the corona pandemic situation.  Without online lectures, what we could do is just staying at home and spending time.  Of course we could study by ourselves, but it's way harder than studying at classroom. online lectures gives us an opertunity to keep study and make in touch with others. Last of all, we could use our time more effectively. Walking down to the lecture room at E11 and way back to dorm is quite long and harsh.  when the weather is too shinny, sweat is additional.  In spite of all these advantages, face to face lecture is better to concentrate and study hard. I hope this situation will end soon.."	3	3	2.5	8.5
1629	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Last year, the serious disease named COVID-19 came up. It was hard to cure but easy to spread. In order to decrease the number of patients, the government had to forbid people from seeing each other. From that moment, the online courses has arisen. When we first had online classes, we had many troubles. It was the first time that many people used online class platform at the same time, so the server was easily paralyzed. Some people needed really long time to learn the online class system. Beside of the difficulties, there were also many advantages of taking online courses.    First of all, we can use more kind of visual supplements than doing offline courses. The online platform such as 'Zoom' or 'Google hangout meets' are linked very well with presentation programs such as 'Powerpoint'. When we were having offline classes. we can only see the TV screen or whiteboards, but now we all have each one's screen individually, so we can see more kind of visual supplements.   Secondly, we don't need to be hurry. We were always chasing by time before online courses. When college students plan their time table, they had to consider the distance between each buildings and classrooms. Sometimes they even had to skip their meal to attend offline courses properly. Now we can just click the link and wait until class to begin.   Lastly, the students who live far from the college can easily take courses. Some of my friends once sad that they have to take subway for almost 2 hours to go their college. Some had to move away from their parents. Now we don't need those problems anymore since we can take courses by just one click.   Until today, many people are worrying about online courses and online platforms. It might be hacked by enemies, we even became easy to sleep in some courses which we don't have to turn on our camera! But beside all those disadvantages, but I bet those three advantages make us keep taking online courses."	3	3	2.5	8.5

The biggest benefit is that i can listen to it wherever i want. Instead of moving busy from place to place to attend the class, all we need is just to turn on the laptop and watch the video. Due to that i can save lot of time everyday. And those saved time will be helpful in many ways. Second. We can watch lecture video again and again until i got to understand it. In offline lecture, the only way to remember the content of it was to write a note. But now I can just watch the lecture again. That is really precious. Still there are few disadvantages, but online lecture have great benefits too. I like it."	2.5	2	2	6.5

"Due to the Corona 19 virus, KAIST has turned most of its class from off-line to on-line. Thanks to this change, many KAIST students get several advantages from online courses in college. The advantages can be classified into two parts: physical advantages and academic advantages.   Instead of going to college every morning, moving from one classroom to the next classroom, online courses enabled students to attend the class at near cafe or even at home and become tireless and comfortable. It reduced lots of walking. Students do not need to move between two classes' buildings. Also, if it was offline courses, there might be situations where some students left important textbook or homework or pencil case or some other stuffs at home. However, most of the students who listen to the lecture at home in online courses won't bump into that horrible situation. Other students who listen to the lecture at cafe near home will waste less time to bring back stuffs left on home.   There are academic adventages, too. FIrst, when the lecture is given recorded, students can go back to the part where they didn't get perfectly. It's much better for students who are timid to ask questions during the lecture on offline course. If students have question, they don't need to wait until the class ends. They can just go on to the Q&A page and write down the question.   These are the two advantages of onlie class. Thankyou."	3	2.5	3	8.5

"These days, many schools and colleges are having online classes because of the COVID 19. Here are 3 advantages of taking online courses. First, we don't have to move to take classes or go to school. Students who are in a college which have big campus size, moving around during breaktime makes one-self very tired. Plus, for the case of my friend, since she didn't 등록 dormitory, she spend more than 2 hours to go to her school every day. On the other hand, if we take online classes, we don't have to move to take class during breaktime, and we don't have to go to school neither. Second, professors can open huge classes which many students can join. For example, the class CoE202(인공지능 입문), the student number who are attending this class is more than 270. If this was not online class, it will be (행하여지다) on a big hall. However, thanks to the zoom, we can take CoE202 with a good quality. (Good quality means we can see the slide, hear professor's voice clearly) Finally, if there is a online platform, such as google classroom or KLMS, it is very convenient. For example, it is much easy to see some notifications, send homeworks to TAs etc."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
1633	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"When I was still a high school student, I dreamed about enjoying my campus life like making friends, getting registered to the club, and having noisy alchohol party. But because of COVID-19, everything changed, even the way we take lectures. As we take online courses in college, first, we can use our break time more efficiently. If we are taking offline courses, it take time to look for and visit the place where the course held. But, as we take online courses, there is no need to go around the campus and spend our time. Also, as we can listen to courses in any place, there is no problem if we have many empty hours between lectures.   Second, there are less absent or late for the lecture as we take online courses. If we have offline lectures, there are several reasons that causes us to be late for class or absent for the lecture like traffic jam, car accident, or being trapped in the elevator. But, as we are taking online courses, we can simply click in to the lecture. So, it became much safer for us.  Third, we can enjoy our night. This might sound awkward, but as we are taking online courses, even if there is 9am lecture, it takes only 5 seconds to join the lecture. And when the lecture is over, as we usually stay in house or dorm for 9am lecture, we can simply have short nap between-lecture-time. What I want to say is, even we stayed up late last night, we can follow up the lecture more easily in comparison to offline courses.  Lastly,  if we want to, we can spend our time with family. I think the best advantage of online courses is that we can listen to lectures in any place we want. So, we can listen to the lecture when we have a family trip. Unlike high school, in university, we usually live our own life and leave from our parents. So, many parents feel sad about their children leaving. But as we are having online courses, we can stay at home during the semester, and we can go for a family trip during the semester because we can listen to the lecture in any places. So we can have extra time to be with our family.   As a student who takes online courses, it's a little bit sad that we can't have offline lectures and can't meet many friends, as I dreamed before I came to the university. But, as I took several online courses,  I became to think like 'It's not that bad to have online courses .' It's quite sad that we can't have offline courses because of COVID-19, but I will do my best to enjoy taking online courses. "	3	2	2.5	7.5

But, if we take online courses, we need not to move. Therefore, we can take a rest during our whole rest time.  Second, It can reduce lateness and absence. Assuming that we take offline courses. If we forget our courses, we must be late or absent from courses. Then, we must lose our attendance grade. It affects our credit. But If we take online courses, we can reduce worry like that. If we forget our courses but we  realize schedule before starting courses, we can attend our courses. It can maintain our credit.

Another advantage is that it can overcome the limits related to space that offline courses had. Students can take classes more efficiently without waste of time caused by moving between classes. Plus, students who had difficulties in participating classes like handicapped people can easily take the lectures.  Last, you can use internet-friendly materials much easier by taking online courses.

First, students don't have to move to take class because many of courses are done in ZOOM meetings or replaced to video classes. If students have to take ZOOM classes, of course, they are similar with offline courses because students have to be in time. But, in video classes, they don't need to do that because the attendances of video classes are done by checking whether students watched video. It means that students can change their timetable as they want. If unexcused something happened, that's OK. If students have many homework to do, that's OK, too. It is allowed to watch video after finishing something you have to do.  Second, students can make environments as they want. They can take classes on their houses, even on their beds. It can help students to make easy while taking classes because they may set their environments that they can be relax and take rest. Also, they can sleep anytime they want. They can sleep just 5 minutes to get rid of fatigue on their beds. Sleeping on bed is quite different from sleeping with the motion of putting head down and making arms like pillow.  Lastly, it is convenient and useful. Students can just get in KLMS site and watch videos. Or click the ZOOM links and just take classes. Even if they are freshman of college, it is easy to do. If the courses are taken by offline, maybe freshmen don't know where to go like ""where is the E6 building?"" or ""I don't know how to go back my dorm."" Of course, there are seniors to help freshmen, but not all of them can help freshmen. On the other hand, it is useful to get a lot of credits. If students take the lab class in offline, they should do experiment in the lab, and write report in time. This is hard for everyone. But if they can take lab classes in online, they don't need to do experiment in the lab. They just need to write report in time. So the online courses help students to get many credits. In my case, I made the timetable which can get 20 credits. I don't think this is hard because all of classes are done in online. Many of students thought like me, so they also applied lots of courses.  These are 3 advantages of taking online courses in college."	3	3	2.5	8.5
1637	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, COVID-19 that prevent people to gather in small place such as lecture room became a biggest issue in our world. To deal with this situation, almost of the college converted lectures to online. Some student argues that the online classes make student hard to focus on studying. However, there are several advantages from online classroom that make the efficiency of studying high. The first benefit from online meeting is time saving. When we proceed lecture on offline environment, student have to walk a lot to find the classroom for next class. If the distance between two places is far away, much time will be consumed by this factor. However, when people get education in online, they can easily move the next class. It gives student time to prepare of remind about lecture. Also, there is no restriction in place. Many people want to use proper tools that can help study. In some cases, it is hard to use that kind of devices or books because desk at the lecture room is not big enough to use them. However, they can do it when they study in network environment.  Those are the advantages that student can earn when the courses are proceed in online."	2.5	2.5	3	8
1638	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"The intriguing topic at hand is whether taking online courses in college has advantages. Of course,  students can't understand professor's lecture well in online class. It is understandable why some people would contend that they think taking online courses in college  have many disadvantages. However, I think that taking online courses in college has advantages which make students more easier to take a class and make students study more efficiently.  To begin with, students can take class more easier. In general, students can access online class link to take a class. To be specific, students and professor can save time and physical strength. For example, If we take offline class, not only students but also professors have to go to the classroom and have to carry heavy books. However, if we take online class, we don't have to move to classroom and we don't have to carry heavy books . So we can save time and physical strength. Hence, students can take class more easier.  Furthermore, students can study more efficiently.  In general, professors upload their lecture, lecture hand-out. To be specific, students can download professors lecture, lecture hand-out and etc. They can listen lecture again and they can understand lecture perfectly. Also, if student lose their lecture note, they can print lecture hand-out again. In conclusion, students can study more efficiently.   In a nutshell, whether taking online courses in college has advantages. I have opinions that I agree that  taking online courses in college has advantages on account that students can take class more easier and  students can study more efficiently. "	3	2	3	8
1639	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I love KAIST. KAIST is really nice university and one of the best university in Korea. However, there is no perfect university. KAIST also has some problems. I think the location is worst thing of KAIST. So I want to change the location of KAIST from Daejeon to Seoul because of several reasons.

First, there is no funny things in Daejeon. The bakery Sung-Sim-Dang is only landmark of Daejeon. Many KAIST students escape Daejeon to search some funny thing every weekend and their goal is Seoul. There is so many funny things in Seoul. Delicious foods, shopping malls, activities, shows, and so on. This is the first reason why I want to change the location of KAIST to Seoul.

Second, my home is in Seoul. If KAIST is in Seoul, I can go home so easily and meet my mom and dad often. Also I lived in Seoul before enter KAIST, so I have many friends in Seoul. I want to see them more.

In conclusion, I want to change the location of KAIST from Daejeon to Seoul because of these reasons. I know Daejeon is also nice city, but Seoul is more friendly to me. If KAIST is in Seoul, my life in KAIST will be happier."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
1640	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST, which stands for Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, is the best university in the area of science and technology in Korea. At KAIST, it is true that all students must speak in English at almost every lecture. In my opinion, it is not proper to use English at KAIST. I would like to suggest that lectures of KAIST do not have to be only in English with two reasons.
    First of all, KAIST students do not have enough English skills. English is not Korean mother language. Most of freshmen are the Korean students who just graduated from high schools and have learned only Mathematics and Science. It is sure that they have not experienced any English environment. They must be in troubles about English.
    The next reason is that some specific courses are not proper to use English. For example, lots of students always get hard time to take major lectures in English. It is because the course materials of major lectures are difficult and hard to understand. Student may not understand them well even in Korean. Professors have to explain the material in Korean additional, because students get hard to understand it in English. It happens frequently. How inefficient is it?
    Some opposed people may mentioned about foreign students who are studying at KAIST. However, there are only a few foreign students, and it is not reasonable for all students to speak in English because of them. People need to determine what the most significant point to teach students is. To sum up, I agree with speaking in Korean at KAIST lectures because of the lack of students' English skills and the courses which are not proper to use English."	5	5	4.5	14.5
1641	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" If there is a chance to change the one important thing in my university, I want to change the laundry system of our dormitory. When I lived in west dormitory calls Hope lounge, laundry place not managed clean enough. After cleaning my cloth using the laundry machine, I can feel always bad smell like fungus and uncomfortable wet smell. I thought that this bad smell was absolutely my fault because usually this smell appears when cloth not enough dried well. However, even I cleaned small amount of cloth and dried as soon as possible after the cleaning, still I can feel the bad smell. There are several reason I found. First, our laundry machine is too old so that input pipeline where water through into the machine is quite a bad condition. It makes the cleaning using the dirty water. Second, some of students close the cover of the laundry machine after finishing the process. This can makes a high humid in machine and a very good environment for a fungus and other bacteria. Obviously, machine in the dormitory is more faster decreasing the ability as a too many use. However, dormitory doesn't care until the machine is broken. As a result, I want to change the laundry place location of dormitory for more comfortable to manage and replace the old machine quickly. "	4.5	3.5	4	12
1642	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I would recommend students to sleep enough simultaneously in regular.
I think KAIST is safe enough for both in night and day for man and woman thanks for police officer. 
However, I think students sometimes skip sleeping because of the tradition of drinking and studying. Both of them are all because of stress in process of being a great person and have fun. 
1.
Before the era of Covid19, it was fine due to many festivals. 
Times go through, students have less chance or interest about enjoying concert held by university. Fortuantely, a few clubs are operated well and it  is worth to share. 
Even though older students are busy to look for their own job and prepare for it, club tradition is essential for KAIST. 
2-2. 
I think there should be more support for students who took a rest in semester 
In addition, giving them some guidelines again is helpful. 
Maybe the participation of OT and remind of life of freshmen is helpful to them. Of course, it includes preparing for next semester and having hobbies. 
2-1. 
The next idea is scholarship for who tried until their limit. They can share their experience and get some scholarship and support. It would help people who got trouble attending KAIST. 
In addition, it helps students to know the exact condition and messages from the friends who couldn't keep contact with. 
In conclusion, I think enjoying the normal festival for all of members of KAIST is necessary. I think clubs, 자치단체 and festival hold by undergraduate students is also helpful for graduate students and professors. 
Secondly, I think support for students' experiences will help them and their friends to overcome the situation. Some stories written by them will touch people's mind. I think also this class have those effect. So maybe the assignments made when they were students should have exact expert, because they are also included in creative making. For example, 이무진's song for assignment was hot for this season. 
In third,  connecting with other university and cities and countries should be encouraged. 
There are some differences and students should travel around and respect their own characteristics. The attitude will help their life to be successful. "	3	3	3.5	9.5
1643	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   KAIST is in Daejeon, not Seoul. Many students say, ""The only one drawback of KAIST is location."" Daejeon is also big city in Korea. But, compare to the university in Seoul, we do not have much opportunity of participation, such as Intern, cultural activity or education. So the one important thing to be changed is the location of my school.
        The first advantage is to increase opportunity of participation. In the perspective of career, most of companies are located in Seoul, and they offer several Intern activity or event for university students. If we were in Seoul, we would get less constraint of time and space. More students can get the more benefits. And there are the more opportunity of cultural activity like concert, exhibition and club activity. We can be more collaborated people.
        Second, there are more interaction with other university, so we can increase our network and meet various people. In KAIST, there are only science and engineering department. Although KAIST is the top university in the world, we might have narrow thought. If we were in Seoul, we can meet many students in other university and interact with them. So we can get more various thought and network. Also we can learn the other culture to increase our adoption in society.
        We can get more participation and interaction, if KAIST were in Seoul. I think KAIST in Seoul is the best university in Korea. Also, the students' talent will be increse than now. So if i get a chance to change one thing of our KAIST, i must change our loaction."	5	5	4.5	14.5
1644	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"      Everyone has at least one dissatisfaction in their school. Sometimes I ask KAIST students like this : ""How do you think about KAIST? Do you regret about entering in KAIST?."" At that time, I wanted to know other's thinking about KAIST because I had some difficulties on surviving at KAIST. There were various answer about my question, but mainly their dissatisfaction was the location of KAIST campus. If I could change one thing about my university, I would move my university to Seoul. Let me tell you the reason why the location is most important issue for students and the advantages of moving campus to Seoul.

      First, taking a rest is very important for KAIST students. We are too busy to study and to do homework. The contents for hanging out with friends are too limited at Daejeon. The students whose campus is in Seoul can enjoy their freetime nevertheless their freetime is short, but KAIST students' free time usually fills with drinking soju or just eating delicious food. Drinking soju and eating delicious food is not so bad, but students want to spend freetime more variety.

      Second,  KAIST would be No.1 university in Korea if KAIST moves to Seoul. I'm not Seoul civilian, so I didn't have any obsessive about entering university which is in Seoul. But I heard many Seoul civilian have the obsessive about that. And if the campus is shown to the students in Seoul and the region near by Seoul, they would study to aim for entering KAIST, not Seoul National University. Watching real campus is more important than we think for students on deciding their goal.

      In conclusion, these are the reason why most KAIST students including me think the location is most preferential thing to change. Actually, nobody think seriously about change the location of KAIST because they know it is impossible in realistically.    "	4.5	5	4	13.5
1645	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  School cafeteria is very important part of the university. The reason is that almost all students and employees use the school cafeteria for their lunch and dinner. It should not be too expensive and it should use good ingredients. I think our cafeteria is doing well on this so a lot of KAIST students satisfy with our cafeteria. However, I want to change some part of our cafeteria if I can. 
  First of all, almost all cafeterias except for few cafeterias close on weekend. However, a lot of students stay at school on weekend. Therefore, students are not able to choose the menu at cafeteria. If they don't like the menu of cafeteria, they should go to the outside which is much far from dormitory compare to the cafeteria. It takes long time and it is expensive. For these reasons, I want the cafeteria to open on weekend.
  Second, For some dormitory, it is so far to go to the cafeteria. For instance, I live in Mir hall which is located in the west of the KAIST. Since there is a small mountain between our dormitory and cafeteria in west, I should walk for a long time to go there. If I go there by walk, it will take about 25 minutes to get there. Therefore, I want to make the path that takes shorter time to reach the cafeteria in west.
  In conclusion, If I could change one important thing about my university, I will change some part of our cafeteria. I will change the cafeteria to open in weekend and to make new path for the students who live in the dormitory that is far from cafeteria. If our cafeteria is changed to this way, I will be happy to go to the cafeteria in KAIST."	5	5	4.5	14.5
1646	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   Nowadays, entering in an university is not as hard as before. I am now studying in the university called Korea Advanced Institute Science Technology (KAIST), which is one of the most famous universities in Korea. Even though I like my university and it considered as a good university in Korea, I want to change one important thing of it, which is the location. Followings are my specific reasons about why I want to change the location of my university.
            First of all, Daejeon does not have many entertainments to enjoy the college life. As far as we know, Daejeon is a big city, but it is really peaceful. To be compared with Seoul, which is the capital of Korea, Daejoen does not have some places that can play like ""lotte world"" in Seoul. KAIST students always have much stress and it is important to rest and get out of stress sometimes. However, KAIST students only can go to eat delicious dinner or go shopping while Seoul National University students are going to lotte world and play extremely. In my opinion, studying hard in the university is important, but enjoying college life is also as important as academy. Therefore, if I could change one important thing in my university, it would be the location of the university.
            Furthermore, Daejeon does not have many opportunities to internships. Since Daejeon is a bit far from Seoul, there are not big companies in Daejeon. During the university, it is quite important to go to internships and get some social experiences. However, for KAIST students, it is very inconvenient to do internships because of the locaiton. Most of students want to do internships in big company and big companies are always located around Seoul. Moreover, if we do internships in Seoul, we should find a place to live during the internship, since it is too far from our dormitory.
            To sum up, my university is good for academy, but since it is far from Seoul, it is uncomfortable for enjoying college life and doing internships. Therefore, if my university were located in Seoul or around Seoul, it would be much better. "	5	5	4.5	14.5
1647	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    People say the freshman term in university is the most beutiful period in whole life. It is a time to meet new friends and study new things in new place. However, my freshman life was not so different with high school life. Of course, one of the reason is COVID-19 situation, but it is also critical reason that I did not participate in university life well. If I can change one thing during my university life, I want to go back to last year and participate almost every events and programs that I can do.
    First at all, I did not make many new friends while freshman period. Because of online lecture, I have no chance to meet other freshman on year. In addition, I try to join in two circle, in Korean 'Dong-a-ri', but both tries failed. Moreover, I did not participate in online festival well. During a freshman period, I communicated only with my friends who I already knew from highschool. Therefore, I felt that freshman in university is simmilar to high school life.
    Furthermore, I not used services that make study efficiently. I got low GPA in both semasters in freshman. I understand that its the most biggest reason is a lack of study time. However, not only the study time, but also my study style also wrong. There are many services and programs in KAIST to support study. For example, KASIT students can ask question about study to seniar and juniar by tutering system, or to proffeser by email directly. Sadly, I did not use those ways efficiently. I try to solve all problem and question by myself, without person who can check I was right or not. This study style makes me misunderstand the lecture, and make lecture more harder.
    To summerize, I missed and passed many chances that make me and my freshman life better. I realize it at winter vacation of freshman, and deeply regret it. Now, I finally join some dong-a-ri, and study with friends. The period that I was freshman never come back. However, it does not mean that I have no chance anymore. I trust that I can make more beutiful life than my freshman period."	4	5	4	13
1648	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" There are several things that I want to change in KAIST. But, to pick one of them, it is ""Academic English courses"". 
  I think current courses for Academic English is not so effective. English ability that each students need is different in details. For example, students that hope to go academic course for research need ability for reading and writing, rather than listening and speaking. Because they have to interpret papers written English. But, students that hope to go company or do business need ability for listening and speaking, rather than reading and writing. Because they have to speak with other people in same business, and present using English for many people. 
  Students need different ability for English in details, as I mentioned above. So I want to change current English course in KAIST. For details, I want to make selective system for English courses. The ""selective system"" means the system that students can choose the English class that they need. For example, students who trying to strengthen writing ability can take the English class about writing skills. I think it can reduce stress from English for students. 
  First, students don't have to study the parts of English that they don't need to strengthen. For example, ""students in intermediate level of English listening and don't need to improve it"" have no more duty for taking ""Academic listening"" class in this system. It can reduce stress of students. Second, students can take the class for their hope. I think it will make the participation of students in class. And, students can improve the ability that they need, or they lake of. 
 In conclusion, it will be good"	4	3.5	4.5	12
1649	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"How long takes time to go to complex terminal or station from the university? It may take about 1 hour. I think 1 hour is too long. So, If I can change one important thing about by university, I want to change the location of the university. There are two reasons to support this opinion.
     First, as I said at initial of essay, it is too far to go to complex terminal or station. Also there is no bus that go to terminal or station directly. We have to change the bus to arrive there. There are many people who came from different cities in university. They may go their hometown every week or every two weeks. For example, I usually go to my hometown every two weeks. whenever I go to my home, it take about 3 hours. However, time to go terminal takes 1 hour among 3 hours. So, if location of our university is near to bus terminal or station, students will be able to go their hometown easily.
     Second, traffic methods to use are restricted. I think traffic method that we can use easily is only bus. However the number of bus that we can use is vary small.  If we want to use subway, we have to take a taxi or ride a bike to go to subway station. Therefore, it is hard to go to other place in Daejeon. So, I want to improve the traffic method by change the location of university.
     In conclusion, Since it is too far to go to complex terminal or station from university and there is no many traffic method to use easily, I want to change the location of university. Then students's life quality will be increased."	5	4.5	4	13.5
1650	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  Comparing with high school or middle school, the university is freer for students because there are not many mandatory subjects students must study. For this reason, we can choose the subject and the major we want to study. However, I think there is one significant policy we have to change. It is grading policy. In my opinion, it is helpful for students to change the grading method from ABC grading to SU grading. There are some reasons why I think so.
  First, we do not need to study by force. You maybe know many students have a hard time for the exam period, and most of them study by force because of their grades. I think this situation is totally wrong because I believe we should study or complete the work voluntarily. Since I think KAIST students are very good at not only studying but also self-management, I think they have the power that they can choose the material to study and study hard for themselves. I feel ABC grading hinders this process.
  Second, we will be able to challenge more things. I have experience with this topic. When I was doing an assignment for this class(HSS011), I feel something strange. I wanted to try the new sentence structure which is not introduced in class, but I could not try that, because I was worried if my score is reduced. Like the situation, I think ABC grading forced students to do just finite things,  although students can do infinite things.
 To summarize, change the grading method from ABC grading to SU grading is necessary for KAIST students for these reasons. I hope KAIST students think about this topic once."	5	5	4.5	14.5
1651	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" 'Kaist' is one of the best university in Korea. It has a wonderful professors, and it's systems are most efficient in Korea. However, there are also disadvantages which I want to change. One of the disadvantages which I hope to be changed is  the location. The location of the university is 'Daejeon'. However, I wish KAIST to move to Seoul. There are several reasons why I think like this.
 First, there are many interactions in Seoul. Meeting many kinds of people is important to university students. Because it can improve one's sights and make experiences. However, in KAIST students only meet people who is KAIST students or neighbor university students. This because there are little university compared to Seoul. 
 Next, it will be more happy if KAIST move to Seoul. Daejeon is a famous place where there are almost no place to have fun.  And Seoul has a lot.  The university students need to have fun a lot. University is the best period to play because of the reality. Therefore,  move to Seoul will help students to enjoy their university life.
 These are the two reasons why I think KAIST should move to Seoul. I think moving to Seoul will improve the quality of university, and give us more  chances to us. "	5	4.5	4	13.5
1652	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   I'm a student of KAIST. KAIST is such a good university in Korea. A lot of Korean students want to go there. KAIST has great education systems and great campus. However, I am not fully satisfying with my university. I want to change a lot of things in my university. If I could change one important thing about my university, I would change every cafeterias and restaurants in campus.
             I love to eat something. In usual, male students do not have a big interest in food. However, I am really interested in it and I know well about foods and restaurants than usual female students. That is why I want to change the total cafeterias and restaurants. First, I want make menus of cafeteria more various. I love to try new menus and new restaurants. I do not like going same restaurant everyday, but in university, it is not easy. Many students go cafeteria to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner. When we go outside of university and eat food for everyday, it spends a lot money and time. College students' most valuable thing is money and time, so we have to eat food in campus a lot. In reality, we go same cafeteria called Kai Maru everyday, because different cafeteria is too far from dormitory. However, there are just few kinds of menus in Kai Maru. It needs just 3 days to get bored about same menu. Next, we need more cafeterias. In our college, there are just few cafeterias, so students are crowded in cafeterias in every lunch and dinner time. We need to wait for eat food and the average waiting time is almost 20 minutes. However, some day we have only 30 minutes to eat lunch. We have to eat really fast or can not eat at all. Last, foods need to be healthier and more delicious. Kai Maru's food is famous for awful taste. Except few menus, taste of menus are too strong and not good at all. I think cafeteria needs to provide more healthier food, not using instant foods and too spicy and salty foods. 
             If there are real change in the food and cafeteria, many students will be happy and do not get stressed about foods. It can even affect to study I think. This will give a big change in our campus life."	5	4.5	4	13.5

" There are many important things in our university life. Someone could think that study is most important, and someone could think that club activities are most important. However, now there are one most important thing that affect to our university life. It is COVID-19. Because of COVID-19 in our university, our university life become abnormal. We lost many things in our university life because of COVID-19. Therefore, if I can change one important thing in my university, I will delete the COVID-19 from my university.
 First reason why I want to delete the COVID-19 from my university is because of studding in university. Because of COVID-19, we cannot study as normal. We have to make distance in our life, so we can cannot study together with our friends in university, and we cannot meet our teachers in offline. Therefore, I hope that COVID-19 will delete from my university and study with my friends and teachers in offline.
 Next reason why I want to delete the COVID-19 from my university is because of university festival. Most of universities had significant size of festival every years, and students in universities could enjoy this festival. However, because of COVID-19, universities could not hold these festivals. My university also had the festival in spring, but it disappear for two years because of COVID-19. Therefore, I hope that COVID-19 is over, and enjoy our university festival.
 To sum up, I want to delete the COVID-19 from my university because I want to study with my friends and teachers as normal, and I want to enjoy our university festival. I know that COVID-19 is global problems, and it will not disappear easily in our life and our university. However, I hope that COVID-19 will disappear at least in our university, and I hope that we could enjoy our university life without COVID-19."	4.5	5	4	13.5
1654	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST is a university one of the best engineering university in Korea. However, KAIST has two critical disadvantages, which would be told below paragraphs. If I could change one important thing about my university, I would establish a college of liberal arts, which can solve these critical disadvantages.   
     First, KAIST students have a difficult in improving their insight. Most people of KAIST have similar childhood such as graduated science high school or gifted school, being interested in science and math from when they are young. Moreover, since their living pattern is also similar, they have a difficult in widening their insight. Therefore, if I establish a college of liberal arts, by communicating between engineering student and liberal arts student, they can improve their insight.
      Second, KAIST has a bias gender rate. It is also critical problem that KAIST has few female students. It gives bad influence not only to male students but also to female students. It is important to know how to deal with different gender people. However, most KAIST male students have a difficult to get enough skills for dealing with female. Female have also problem. They have few same gender friends who can share their difficulty. Thus, by establishing a college of liberal arts, KAIST can increase a rate of female students.
    In conclusion, KAIST has two critical disadvantages. First is KAIST students have a difficult in improving their insight. Second is KAIST has a bias gender rate. KAIST can solve these problems with one method. It is establishing a college of liberal arts."	5	4	4.5	13.5

It is an essential rule of our university so all students and professors must use English in class.  Some would argue that the English class would increase the English ability of students and it helps that the students go over the world. On the other hand, others maintain that English would interrupt students' studying ability. I also believe that using English in every class would decrease the level of students since there are many students who do not participate in class due to English and then there are limits to deliver some logical things. I want to change English class in KAIST.
Most of all,  English classes reduce students' rate of participation. In my case, my English ability like reading, listening, speaking, and writing is low rather than others. I cannot understand most parts of the video or explanation and I cannot ask some question about the class. It is not only my problem. Many friends have these problems and they always say these problems. Surely, we should study English and increase our English ability more. However, not only the speed of increasing our ability is slow but also It is not easy.
Second, there are limits in the transfer of the logical structure. In KAIST, most professors and students are Korean. They have used Korean until now and they would feel comfortable when using Korean. There are professors who have low English levels among professors in low probability. Then some professor who has low only read ppt. In studying, It is important to transfer the logical sturcture but there are limits when we use English. Especially, there are larger problems in natural science such as physic, chemistry, etc.
In conclusion, I want to change the system of English class. There are two big problem, one thing is it would reduce students' rate of participation and other is that there are limits in the transfer of the logical structure. I think that if it will be improved, there will be many good point"	5	4.5	4	13.5
1656	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"As age of education approaches, university has become important in Korean society. Each university has different trait. So, there are many debate about things that have to be changed. Have you ever thought about this? If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? I want to change dormitory. In this paper, I want to explain my opinion for several reasons.
  First of all, I want to change quality of university dormitory building. That is too old. For example, there are a room where we can take a rest. In that room, the microwave and chair is sometimes do not work. Similarly, the cleaning machine in the restroom is so dirty. When I use this to cleaning my underwear. My white socks and pants was getting dirty. If I could, I want to change about this.
  Second, I want to change management system of air conditioner in my university. The summer is coming , the temperature is getting hot. Turning on the air conditioner in all of our dormitory is needed , so that we could study under the cooling and optimum condition. However, there are some dormitory where the air conditioner is not turned on yet. In addition, because of this, one person ,who lived in that dormitory, says ,""I can't sleep at night because of hot temperature."" this is serious problem. Therefore, I strictly want change this unequal system, too.
   To sum up, you can see that the changing of dormitory system about the quality of cleaning and the air conditioner management is very important to increasing the quality of our campus life by using the well working microwave and clean machine. Only the voice, which ask some changing point about our university, changes our campus life."	5	4.5	4	13.5
1657	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Do you know about all sites in Korea Academy Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)? Some students do not notice these so they have difficulty about adaptation to KAIST. Therefore, I think our university should make a Kakao KAIST that informs KAIST, such as events and sites.  
 The first function of the Kakao KAIST is explaining KAIST's events. There are many events in KAIST like the KAIST-POSTECH War or the Strawberry Festival. However, some KAIST students do not have a method for knowing its dates because there are no people who report them. Therefore, Kakao KAIST should have a function that informs the events of KAIST before these events begin.
 Kakao KAIST reports also sites of KAIST. KAIST has lots of sites, such as KLMS, mail, and portal sites. For example, some freshmen confuse about applying for their courses because they cannot adapt to many KAIST sites. In fact, some students do not notice portal sites of KAIST so they lose applying for their courses. Therefore, Kakao KAIST has to report KAIST sites for their freshmen.
 To sum up, KAIST has to make Kakao KAIST whose can explain the events and sites of KAIST to their students. Furthermore, they should add Kakao KAIST's URL in students' ID cards to report to students about many things about KAIST."	5	4.5	4	13.5
1658	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  I love my university, KAIST. I believe that KAIST is the best university in Korea. KAIST is almost perfect, but it has only one thing that makes me sad. That is the location of my university. I sometimes feel sad because of it.
  Therefore, if I could change only one thing about KAIST, I want to change the location of my university. Moreover, I want to move KAIST to Seoul or near to Seoul. I have three reasons for my opinion.
  First of all, my university is so far from my house. I live in Suwon, in Kyung-gi do, so if I want to go KAIST, it takes much time and money. Even if my parents drive their car for me, it takes about 2 hours, so it is very hard work. Of course, there are other ways to go to KAIST that take KTX or SRT. If I ride them, time will be saved, but they are pretty expensive. 
  Secondly, most of my friends are in Seoul or near Kyung-gi do. I went to my high school in Sejong, but there are many friends who live in Seoul. I graduated my high school now, but I usually miss them. However, I am in Daejeon, so it is too hard to meet my friends in Seoul. Although my friends sometimes come to Daejeon to meet me, I want to see them more. 
  Lastly, there are many convenient systems in Seoul. First, I can go anywhere in Seoul so fast because of subways and buses. There are also very many places to enjoy. We can go Gang-nam, or other hot places in Seoul. Because of COVID-19, I can't play there with my friends, but after everything become better, Seoul will be the best place to meet my friends
  In conclusion, I want to change my university's geometrical location because KAIST is so far from my house and my friends, and there are many convenient systems in Seoul. Of course, there are not only disadvantages but also advantages because KAIST is in Daejeon. For example, Daejeon has very many scientific organizations, so we can focus on our research or studies. I know that it is impossible that move my university, so I just do my best in KAIST, in Daejeon."	4.5	4	4.5	13
1659	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" My University, KAIST, is one of the best universities in the world. It has very organized departments and the professors are all world-class. However, I believe that there is still room to grow and improve. The university is wold-wide and, it has enrolled competitive international students. It has weak approaches towards the international community. I have met some university students who do not know the rules of the country and have suffered a lot because of this. I myself have faced problems that I would not face if anybody told me before. Therefore, in this essay, I will mention two reasons why KAIST should work hard to improve its approach to its international community.

       The first reason is that many foreign students faced problems regarding VISA extension and related immigration problems. I can present myself as a compelling example of this.  I was fined around 400 US dollars for not changing my D-4 VISA to D-2  VISA on time. I would have not paid this amount of money if I was informed about this before by KAIST. As a student, any foreign national who faces such kind of problem would not quickly recover from the financial crisis created by such havoc. Therefore,  organizing a team that gives a briefing on VISA and immigration issues is important to alleviate any problem that can happen without knowing.

        The second reason is that  internationals feel isolated in the university.  One of the main reasons for this is the language barrier. There is an outcry of loneliness and dissatisfaction from the international students on the anonymous Facebook page.  Encourging students to engage in cultural events and to practice their Korean language would solve this problem. Moreover, creating a strong tie between international students and domestic students plays a vital role in creating a harmonious university environment. This way, KASIT could shine more globally. In general,  the role of forming a club or a group which promotes the relationship between international students and domestic culture would solve the problems of the students as well as renew the spirit of cooperation.

         To sum up, If I get an opportunity to change one thing about KIAST  I would improve the university's image  in the mind of international students.  The main reason that this change needs to be applicable is that the international community in KAIST has faced problems because of not knowing important rules and regulations in the country. Moreover, some international students have had a hard time intermingling with domestic students due to the cultural difference and language barrier.  Hence, this problem needs immediate action, and the best measure is to create groups or clubs that exclusively work on such issues."	5	5	4.5	14.5
1660	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    Almost all of KAIST class must use the English. But it has many inefficient points. So if I can change one thing in KAIST, I  want to change about English usage policy in KAIST.
    First, sometimes English is inefficient to understand difficult class. When students study about their major class, it is not easy. But, not only difficult major but also English is stress. When students learn about difficult thing, often english is inefficient. 
    Second, KAIST English lecture curriculum is good. So if KAIST extend neccesity English lecture, it will be good choice for student's English skills. Every class don't have to use English.
    Third, I felt difficult to study. It is very personal thing. English was my complex. When I study major lecture, always I find word's meaning. Sometimes I couldn't question to professor. Because I didn't say my question at English. Also I know that English is very important. Nevertheless KAIST's English policy is bad way for some students.
    In conclusion, KAIST's English policy is inefficient about many cases. So I want to change. Every class don't have to use Englsih. And I want to extend English curriculum in KAIST. Then students' studying efficiency will increase."	4.5	4	3.5	12
1661	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   If I can change one important thing about KAIST, I will change the location of the university to Seoul. KAIST is one of the most famous science and technology universities in Korea. However, it is located in Dejon, far from Seoul. I think this is a big disadvantage for my university for two reasons. 
     First, communication with other universities is restricted by this location problem. University students do lots of things with other students from other universities, such as club activities, and research projects. However, it is hard for KAIST students to do activities like these because they don't have many universities around them.
     Second, students sometimes need to fresh their brains, by playing with other friends. Most of the students drink alcohol with their friends or hanging around the city where the university is located. It is true that Dejon is a good city to live in. But, have fewer places to play, compare to Seoul.
     In conclusion, I think KAIST can be improved, if it moves to Seoul. I saw some friends choose another university rather than choose KAIST, because of the location problem. Almost half of the students and people living around Seoul. So, if KAIST is located in Seoul, it can make our university better than before. "	5	4.5	4.5	14
1662	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"As a KAIST student, I really like my university. There are many good things in KAIST. Many great and kind professors, high technology device, and education program such as KLMS are the examples. But it will be a lie, if there are only good things.  There are few things that want to change. Specially, I want to change about grading. It is important for all students and professors. Now, I will present why I want to change grading process.

First, ABC grading programs are too old program. ABC grading program was used when my parents are in university. In some case of class, they can chose SU grade or ABC grade. People know already about KAIST students are smart. I think it will not need who is better than the others. ABC is too old programs, It should be change to another thing such as SU grade.

Second thing is final exam percentage are too big. May be many student and professor know about the percentage of final exam. Most of final exam percentage is 40~45%. Some subjects are almost half of entire grade percentage. This situation causes the unfair of  grade. For example, one student did really hard at homework and attend. Student got good grade on middle exam, but when student took a final exam, student was sick. So he got a bad scores on final exam and low grade. As the student student did hard work entire semester. But one mistake on final exam make student get low grade. As a example, I think it should be changed the percentage of exams.

Last one is about the assignment. In KAIST, all students have assignments every week. When they finish one assignment, they should start next and next assignments. Moreover, there are same amount of assignment during the exam week. Also assignment is not easy because of KAIST students. It needs more the 1 days for 1 assignment. But score and percentage of assignment are really low. In case of program subject, there is lab homework every week. Some program is really hard. It need a lot of time someone is not good at program such as me. I did it really hard, but the lab homework is not effect on grades. Student should do it, but it is not effect to grade. It should be changed. KAIST should change the assignment amount, percentage, or levels. 

As the three reasons,  KAIST should change the grading system. If KAIST change it, KAIST can be better than before. As a student in KAIST, changing the grading system make the happy college life. KAIST is one of the greatest school in Korea."	5	4.5	4	13.5
1663	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    KAIST is one of the most popular universities in Korea. It's nice enough for students and professors, but there is a problem. The problem is that KAIST is located in Daejeon. There are many labotories and institutes about science, so it can be a great place. But I want to change KAIST's location to Seoul. Here are my reasons.
    First of all, many people live nearby Seoul. Over 20 millions of people live nearby Seoul and Gyeonggi-do, so they have to take train or bus to visit their home. Furthermore, It's far between KAIST and Daejeon station. For example, I live in Anyang. It takes 3.5 hours to go there. If KAIST was located in Seoul, It would take less than 2 hours.
    Second, Daejeon doesn't have enough places to play. Many special places such as amusement park are usually located in Seoul. When I meet my girlfriend in Daejeon, we don't have place to go. One amusement park, 'Daejeon O-world' is very small. Because of these reasons, many people call Daejeon, ""not-fun city"".
    Third, students of KAIST don't have opportunity to meet other students from Seoul. There are high-ranked universities in Seoul such as Korea university. Because of our location, we can't have any chance to meet them. Only Chung-nam university is near, but it's not enough.
    There are many things that we can't get because of our location. So I want to move location of KAIST to Seoul for time, fun and friends. Thank you for reading my opinion."	4.5	4	3	11.5
1664	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  When I first saw inside of the KAIST, the most impressive thing except something related with study or research was Ryu Keunchul Sports Complex. In there, people did many sports like basketball. For me who like basketball, It was amazing feeling by its massive size, good state, and variable use. But by COVID-19, Sports Complex has been closed or limited to use since early 2020. Now I think it is time to remove the limitation for use of Sports Complex. KAIST student should use that place freely. Let me tell you the reason.
  First, we should think the student's right. For students who like to plat sports, they will want to use Sports Complex, but they cannot use freely because university blocked it. This situation is the case student's right is not considered. They should have the right to use the place in KAIST freely as KAIST students.
  Second, students is getting tired. When I was in school at January 2020 by some class, after a series of hard classes, I get rid of my stress from playing basketball at night. Also the research says playing sports is helpful for not only our physical health but also our psychological health by expose of some hormones which affect people to feel happy. Like this, playing sports is funny thing and the way to remove stresses. But now, students feel hard to find some place to play sports, then this can lead to depression and getting tired.
  In conclusion, Sports complex which has massive size should be opened now. I think these negative affects is bigger than the positive things by limitation. Of course preventing spread of virus is important, but if limitation is too long, students' life is too tired and depressed. If we prevent to use of people who is not related with KAIST and manage the place, for example, cleaning  and tak very well, we can avoid some bad situation by COVID-19. It is time to change."	5	4.5	4	13.5
1665	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"      According to static of 2017, static says students of KAIST spent 30 hours a week studying their major. This quantity is the highest time in university of Korea. This means many students of KAIST have a focus on studying. Should we spend most of the time in studying? My answer is strongly ""NO"". If we only spend our time studying in library, it is same as wasting a time. So, KAIST must decrease the quantity of studying for students.
        First of all, in KAIST, there are sufficient opportunities that help advance us. That is, students can conduct diverse things like completing projects, meeting various people, and etc. There are so many things that we cannot write in this paragraph. So, I mentioned the very important two things. Completing projects, which many succeed people say it is priceless, is very long memory as we live. Completing projects yourselves will enhance your ability of collaboration, knowledge about that, and especially it gives us experience. To experience directly is very valuable as it gives us what we cannot learn from theory. Also, if we meet various people in diverse fields, we can accept and exchange many thoughts. It is also useful as we live.
        Last but not least, decreasing the quantity of studying will increase quality of life of students. As students have more time, they can take a sufficient rest, and release their stress easily. Especially recently, many people thinks work-life balance is very important. If students find this value important, it will make a fresh atmosphere in campus. Then, energetic circumstances will increase the efficiency of various activities. Therefore, it will make a positive circle in KAIST.
        In summary, students should not be tied in studying. There are tremendous things that cannot get in a chair. Students should experience diverse activities, and it can develop themselves. Like this, decreasing the quantity of studying will carry enormous things to students. KAIST should make students sufficiently free."	5	4	4	13
1666	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST is a superb university at science and technology, but like all other universities, there's several things that can be modified. In my case, if I could change one thing about our university, I like to make classes that professor and students can use english and korean freely. I will inform you why I want to do that.
First, english could deter fluent expressions about thoughts. This is a quite a problem especially in university, in that it is the place where the active interactions and opinion exchanges are seriously required. This kind of limitation emerges when we are participating in class. Although professors can speak in english sufficiently for conveying informations, but there's substantial loss in content when professors convey their own thoughts and visions, which require sophisticated methods to be expressed. As a result, classes that only uses english can just end up with reading lecture notes or textbooks.
Second, it is not convincing that using english in classes can improve student's overall language abilities. This reason is particularly related to my own experience. For several years, I've seen various kinds of videos in YouTube which are in english, but I'm not confident that I can use english freely. I believe that the second language acquisition being done by listening and reading has a critical point that cannot be surpassed without actual interactions.
In conclusion, using only english in class can lower the quality of lecture, and the reason that classes in english can improve student's language ability is not that reasonable. In my opinion, the ultimate purpose of university is improving one's thoughts to be more complex and detailed, and using only english in class could make the exact opposite result. Constructing thoughts should be done before using foreign language."	5	5	4.5	14.5
1667	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I'm a student of the KAIST which is the greatest and most popular engineering university in Korea. KAIST has many advantages such as a nice dormitory system and great professors, and I am very satisfied from them. However, I think the location is the only disadvantage of the KAIST. KAIST is located in Daejeon, not Seoul. If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I will change the location of the KAIST from Daejeon to Seoul for some reasons.
 First, transformation system of Daejeon is not as comfortable as the system of Seoul for students. Students of university usually don't have their own car, so they ride a bike or walk around. If they must move longer distance, they have to use bus or taxi. In the case of KAIST, there is not enough taxi. I saw many students missing the train because of the lack of taxi. How about the bus? In order to take a bus, students have to go to the front gate or east gate of KAIST which is very far from their dormitory. Moreover, underground train in Daejeon has only one route, and distance between KAIST and the closest station is still very far. In the case of Seoul, the capital city of Korea, it is more advanced and complex city. There are more bus stations and underground train routes. Using those two traffic system makes the transformation of students very comfortable and convenient. 
 Second, students of KAIST can not experience more various thing because of their location. Most of the facilities are concentrated in Seoul, and almost of the festivals or expo are held in Seoul. Thus, in order to have various experience, KAIST students should go to the Seoul. However, it is not simple. They should get the train at least 1 hour, and the cost of the transformation is quite expensive. Because of the time and cost, KAIST students can't make a decision easily of going to Seoul and can't have experience. Most of the companies are also in Seoul, so the location is one of the reason why KAIST students stay and study more after graduation.
 In short, location of the KAIST, Daejeon, is quite uncomfortable because of the transfomation system and the lack of experience. Therefore, if I could change one thing about KAIST, I will change the location from Daejeon to Seoul."	5	5	4	14
1668	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"       All of Kaist students have to learn the sports classes. In every semester, sports classes make somebody can not graduate the university. Because,we need luck to learn the sports class. Of course, health is important to study hard, and sports classes make many students healthy. However, there are too many bad points of the sports classes. I am going to talk about 3 main reasons why we need to change something about sports classes.

        First, our ability of sports are different, but sports classes can not give different study. It means some people feel too hard from class, and somebody feel too easy. This is not good for our health. And it makes we can not get any interest from exercise. In this situation, it means exercise ourselves is better than sports class.

        Second, it makes the gender issue. In our university, some sports club members do not have to learn one sports class. It is unfair process about gender. Because, It is very hard to be sports club members for man without the ability of sports. For example, I failed to be soccer club member because I am not good at soccer. But, it is easy for women with manager process. It makes a big issue about gender, so we need some change about sports classes and process. 

        Finally, we do not have enough sports class. Every students have to learn one or two sports classes. But in one semester, only 200 people can get sports classes. To learn a sports class, we need to be selected from random. It means we have to be selected to graduate. I think it is very fun situation. Also in this situation, we can't learn sports class which we want. We need some solution about these problems. 

       In summary, sports classes make us healthy. But, It makes gender issue and graduate issue. Also, it is not better than exercise ourselves. In my opinion, university should delete sports classes, and make some facilities to exercise in university. Except some dormitories, we don't have a place to exercise well. We do not need the class to exercise, we need place to exercise."	4.5	4	3.5	12
1669	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I love my university, KAIST. Our campus is so beautiful and our education is the highest level among the world. Even KAIST is awesome university, however, some of students have some demands to change KAIST. I think that the most important thing to develop KAIST is the sufficient rest time with some reasons.
 First, KAIST have too many assignments. Since KAIST is university for technology and science, it has many experiments and calculation homework. That kinds of work need so much time to solve. It is common to study at midnight in KAIST. Our dormitory even has no time limit to sleep. It makes body clock of student be confused. In fact, I got backache since I often slept at desk midnight. Therefore, KAIST should make sufficient sleep time to students.
 Second, KAIST demands too many classes to graduate. Since each class have many assignments, we cannot take enough classes if we take care about grade. I heard that many of KAISTian are early-graduated from high school, and many of them decided to take one more year in KAIST. Of course, I think every lectures are very nice to study, but late-graduate is disadvantage for compony entrance candidate. So, we should have less time to solve assignments by make sufficient rest time.
 In conclusion, KAIST demand too much time to study now, and it harms health of the students and time to take other lectures. I graduated science high school, and it had many lectures and assignment similarly. So, many students had to study at midnight, and school thought we need more rest time. As a result, school made a extra space to take a rest, and that made efficiency of studying more efficient. I guess the enough rest time for students will bring the more efficient learning. Therefore KAIST should consider about developing the rest time."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1670	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST, my university, has lots of great benefits. For example, it has lots of programs, festivals, and team projects. But if I could change one thing in KAIST, I would change the lecture in English. Now I will tell you two reasons why I want to change it.
First, students have a hard time having English lectures. For example, my friends who did not have studied English a lot, have a hard time understanding lectures in English. That makes student's academic performance to get decreased because they can't understand what the professor is explaining. If students do not understand the lecture, they have to study that part again and again, which is inefficient.
Second, professors have a hard time speaking in English too. When I was taking the course, Signals and System, the professor said he has a hard time having lectures in English. He said he will use his mother language sometimes. Like this, professors also have a hard time having lectures.
The English lectures have been used since 2004. At that time, four students and one professor have committed suicide because of the English lecture. Also, about 35 professors lost their job because they did not pass the English test. Nowadays, students and professors have to study English because of the test they have to take. This is annoying to everybody at KAIST. In conclusion, students and professors have a hard time having English lectures, so I want to change this part in KAIST."	5	4.5	4.5	14
1671	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     Where people live is the most important thing in people's life. It determines the quality of lives cause home is the place is where you sleep, take a rest, or get an inner peace. Since students of KAIST are living in dormitory of school, dormitory is a huge factor that determine the students' life. However, dormitory in KAIST is not that good to live, though it has very reasonable price. I think that dormitory is one of the most important things should be changed in KAIST. 
     First, there are too many warms. If you had lived in dorm in KAIST, you might experience of facing warms. I saw warm called '돈벌레' and '바퀴벌레' in dormitory last week. It is not only bad for the sight but also bad for health since '바퀴벌레' lives in the environment that is dirty and could spread a virus. Many students cared about the bugs in dorm. If the environments have changed, it would be more happy dormitory life. 
     Second, It is old and small. Almost dorm in KAIST is over 20 years old, so it ha s germs called '곰팡이' in the walls and windows, and average size of dorm is less than '4평', the unit used in Korea. The size of dorm is too small to live with 2 people, which contains bathroom, shower room, two closets, two desks, and two beds. There is almost no place except these furnitures. In my experience, I took a exercise class in my room, but it is almost imposible to do. I think room size matter after the Covid-19 since it make more time to spend in dormitory. However, it would be great if the dormitory remodeled, so that students can live in better environment.
   In conclusion, dormitory in KAIST has 2 disadvantages which is warms, old and small. If these disadvantages are improved, it becomes the best dormitory in the world. I hope students can live in better environments. "	4.5	4	3.5	12
1672	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     My university is KAIST, one of the best universities in South Korea. I'm proud of my university. But, If I could change one thing about my university, I would change the Silloe Hall. I live in the Silloe Hall. There's so many inconvenient points that I think redesigning is the only answer. So, I'll discuss why I want to redesign the Silloe Hall of KAIST. There are Three reasons.
     First,  the Silloe Hall is too old. Almost part of the Silloe Hall is not in fine condition. Wall of building can't block humidity from outside. Rooms are too small. Every night, air conditioner turns itself off by error. Filter of air conditioners are not cleaned. vending machine in front of the Silloe Hall makes error every morning. Until May, drying machine in first floor was out of order. There are more things which is out of order in the Silloe Hall.
     Second, orientation of the Silloe Hall's is strange. Unlike other north dormitories, the Silloe hall faces strange direction. Its direction is perpendicular to other north dormitories. Because of its orientation, half of the rooms in the Silloe Hall face sun for the entire afternoon, and half of the rooms in the other side of the Silloe Hall can't face sun forever. My room is always in shadow, too. 
     Third, Silloe Hall is too far from outside. Because cooking inside the dormitory is impossible, I and my friends usually order food with delivery application. But, some restaurants which delivery food with motorcycle can't reach Silloe Hall. Then, we should take our meal in front of women's dormitory, which locates next to the road. It's too far.
     To sum up, if I could change one thing about my university, I would redesign the Silloe Hall because it's too old, its orientation is strange, and its too far from outside."	5	5	4.5	14.5
1673	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Because of the COVID - 19 situation, KAIST excuted a method that all classes should be held on online class. So the Intermediate English Reading and Writing classes is also held on online class in spring semester. But I think our classes should be held on offline classes. 
              First of all,  this class was completely done, I think this class had lacking point. This class such as other English classes needs to interact each other but because of COVID - 19 we should held on online class and we can not interact each other.  Also, If we held on offline classes, We can do assignment together so we can give feedback immediately. 
             Second, many people in KAIST feel more fun about offline classes. Now many people in KAIST have boring because during online classes, we cannot meet new friends. And my friends say ""I am not making a girl friend  because of the online classes. Also due to online classes, many students have yet to come to school.  So many students will be able to feel the beauty of KAIST campus if they can do offline activities. 
             Lastly, offline classes will ensure fairness in taking the test. But it does not matter if we take a test with multiple cameras, there are few test that are not fully managed. Indeed, as far as I know, there is a lot of cheating going on in such tests. The biggest problem with online classes is fairness.
            Online classes make us lose fairness and fun. I think these are the two most important things in college life. It is said that vaccines against COVID-19 are now available and that people who wear masks are less likely to be infected. I think "	4	3.5	3.5	11
1674	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     KAIST is one of the best university in the world. KAIST has plenty of things that students can enjoy their academic life. However, there is one important thing about KAIST to change. It is the dormitory problem.
      First, some dormitories of KAIST are very old. There are cracks on the walls and floors, and they are very dangerous for students in the dormitory. For example, my friend in KAIST dormitory said, ""If an earthquake happens at KAIST, people in the dormitory must die first.""
     Second, students suffer from harmful bugs. Behind the dormitory, there is a mountain. Therefore, bugs are everywhere in the dormitory. For example, my friend in KAIST dormitory said, ""There are so many bugs, and they climb up to my bed."" In addition, there are plenty of garbages in the dormitory, bugs like the environment of dormitory. They are also harmful to people. There are many bugs that have poison.
     In conclusion, the dormitory problem must be solved. First, some dormitories of KAIST are very old. Second, students suffer from harmful bugs. The dormitory is the place that students spend most of the time. Therefore, KAIST have to solve the dormitory problem."	5	4.5	4	13.5
1675	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"My university is KAIST focuses on science and technology in Korea. There are many differences between different universities because of the focus of science and technology. Because of the gender imbalance in my university and the difficulty of taking classes in various fields, I think KAIST students cannot have various experience. From now on, I will explain what I want to change to our school.
     First of all, I want to change the gender imbalance in my university. According to this year's statistics, KAIST's gender ratio is 8 to 2, which has a very large gender imbalance. There is a word ""hakyeondong"" in Korea. It means love experience is important as studing. However, many male students in KAIST are in a difficult environment to have love experience as university stuents. Gender ratio is important not only in love but also in academic and various thoughts. So, I hope many female students enter KAIST and balance the gender ratio of the KAIST.
     Last, I want to change my university so that I can take classes in various fields. In KAIST student community, it is often posted that they want to take classes in various fields. Due to the nature of KAIST, the propotion of major classes in engineering is overwhelmingly high and there are limited types of liberal arts classes available. I think cutural knowledge is important to engineer. So, I hope KAIST will open many liberal arts classes so that students can have various knowledge.
     To sum up, I hope KAIST students have various experience. To move in that direction, KAIST should make improvements in the gender imbalance and number of liberal arts classes. I hope KAIST students study with various experiences in KAIST and do more wonderful things in the world as engineer."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
1676	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"For many students, KAIST is one of the universities that everyone want to study in. Almost every people think KAIST is one of the best universities in Korea. And I also think it is true. Unfortunately, however the university is good, there exists not good things in there. I think it is in our educational system . If I can change one thing is KAIST, I'll change some part of it. I will make student more creative and smarter for our future. This do not means studying science and technology more hard. I mean study about world. I'll explain how and why I want to change educational system.
    First, KAIST have to teach society for students. Science technology comes from people's uncomfortable things. We develop fans because it's too hot in summer, we developed robots because we don't want to work hard. There are many problems like that in our society. And its answer is technology. To know about these problems that people have, we should know society. But in KAIST, many people don't know about society. Reading newspapers, watching TV news programs, to go out of KAIST and meet lots of people are such a good way to know society. But many students are stalling in KAIST and just study science and technology. I think studying society is very important. And KAIST should know this.
    Second, KAIST have to make students read more books. There are not bad books. Reading comic books, fantasy novel is not a problem. When you read comic books, creativity grows. When you read novel, you can know other people's life. We know almost every successful people read many books, even if he or she works at scientific company. If we meet someone at street and ask about reading books, almost everyone will reply that reading books is important. But many people do not read books. I think this is big problem. For more creative KAIST, we should read many books.
    To summarize, I want to change some part of educational system. I explained about teaching society and reading books. But it is not enough. There are many things, not in science or technology parts, we should study. If we want KAIST to be better and make KAIST best university in world, we should focus on these parts too."	4	3.5	4	11.5
1677	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     KAIST is a great university. It has lots of advantages for students. There are lots of buildings for students such as libraries, cafes, stores, and sports places. However, even though there are lots of advantages in KAIST, they still have some disadvantages. I think the most important problem in KAIST is social transportation. If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I would add social bike stations in KAIST. There are two main reasons why.
     First, KAIST has a huge campus. It takes about 20 minutes to go to the front door of KAIST from the dormitory. Many students go out to Ueun-Dong and Gung-Dong for their meal, and those two places are very close to KAIST. However, because of the huge campus, students use lots of strength and time to go those places. My friend, who is a freshman in KAIST, said, ""It takes so much time to move in the campus, and I can't manage some urgent problems in the dormitory if I am outside."" Social bike stations would be very helpful for students to move inside the campus.
     Second, other social transportation in KAIST are limited. Most of KAIST students used to ride a scooter or a taxi. However, a driver's license is needed to ride a scooter, and there are lots of students who don't have a driver's license. Also, taxi is expensive, and it is hard to always use the taxi. There are some students who ride there personal bikes, but it is hard to take it to the campus. Social bike stations are  cheap, convenient, and easy to use.
     In conclusion, social bike stations can be very helpful for KAIST students. KAIST has a huge campus, and unlimited social transportation is needed for KAIST students.  I am very thankful for several advantages in KAIST, but social transportation is still a problem. I really hope for social bike stations in KAIST. It will be so helpful!"	5	5	4	14
1678	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  Are you participate any clubs in KAIST? I am participating in two clubs in KAIST. In my opinion, KAIST's club culture is very bad. If I could change one important thing in KAIST, I will change club culture. I will remove people number restriction in each clubs because it causes a lot of problems.
  First, people number restriction decreases meaning of the clubs. Club is group of people who are interested in some common subject. However, in KAIST,  It is hard to participate in some club because each clubs have people number restriction. So, many students try many clubs even they are not insterested in that club. At the end, each clubs are composed of people who are not interested in that club.  Also, failed students make other minor-clubs because they are really interested in that subject. This situation is not only unefficient but also waste of club-center money. However, we can prove this situation very easily by removing people number restriction.
  Second, people number restriction make failed students. I can see students who are interested in some subject, but they failed in that subjcet club. KAIST students are very busy and they don't have many time to do hobby. Clubs are very good way to do hobby with friends, but most of students can not participate in that club because of restriction.
  In conclusion, If I could change one important thing in KAIST, I will remove people number restriction in each clubs. I also agree with that some special clubs need people number restriction. In the other word, most clubs do not need people number restriction. This restriction causes many problems. It decrease meaning of clubs and make failed students. I have not seen any university that club has people number restriciton. It is very important  thing for students and it should be changed as soon as possible."	4.5	4.5	4	13
1679	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"There are many things which I want to change in my university. If I choose one thing, I want to change a position of our university to Seoul. There are three reasons for it.
The first reason is that now my university lacks place to play. For example, there are many places to play in Seoul. In Seoul, people can enjoy the culture like movie, eat foods in famous cafeteria, and ride rollercoaster. Dajeon has some of them, but the number of them is so little.
Second, the traffic is bad in Dajeon. A subway in Dajeon has only one line. It is not easy to use subway. Therfore, people often use bus. In my case, I use almost one day in oredr to go to university from my home. But in Seoul, there are many subway lines. So, people can go around easily.


Finally, many famous companies are in Seoul. I think that a university is period to be ready to go company. So, it is not comfortable that a company that I want to go and the university are far away from each other. For example, you study in oredr to go the company in the university. Then you go to the company in Seoul for only interview. It needs not only time, but also money.
To sum up, Seoul is better than Dajeon in place to play, traffic, and position of company. Furthermore, people say for joke that ""if KAIST go to Seoul, Kaist win the Seoul university easily."" Although this is just joke, if KAIST go to Seoul, I think that students can enjoy more comfortalbe campus life. "	5	4.5	3.5	13
1680	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     I think one of the best college in Korea is KAIST. KAIST helps students can study whatever they want. And KAIST gives us good environments. But there is a problem in campus that needs to be changed. If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I will change the location of smoking areas and the form of smoking areas in KAIST.
    First reason that I want to change smoking areas is the form of smoking areas. There are holes on walls that surround smoking areas. Through the holes, smoke move out of the smoking areas. And smoke reach other people . Because of this, in fact, the walls are useless. So, I want to change the form of smoking areas to be surrounded by  walls with no holes.
    Second, I want to change smoking areas in KAIST because of the location of them. There are some exercise equipments in campus. The purpose of them is caring our health. But there are some cases that smoking area is next to the some exercise equipments. When we exercise, we breathe fastly than usual. So, if there is smoking area next to exercise equipments, it will give really bad effects to our health. Therefore, it is ironic that smoking areas are located next to the exercise equipments.
   To summarize, there are some problems with smoking areas because of the location of smoking areas and the form of smoking areas.  Because of these reasons, we need to change the location and the form of smoking areas in KAIST to make better campus."	5	4.5	4	13.5
1681	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"
          KAIST, one of the best university in Korea is in Daejon.  So, most of the KAIST students have to live in Daejon more than 5 years. Of couree Daejon is good city, but if I could change on thing form KAIST, I want to replace KAIST Seoul from Daejon for three reasons.
          First , Daejon and Seoul have huge difference between acceibiilty to other cultures and  doing activities. Many famous musicians do their concert only in Seoul. For example, Psy, IU and AKMU concerts are held in Seoul, but Daejon did not. Not only for concerts, many festivals are held only in Seoul. Also, Seoul has many cities like  Sinchon, Hongdae or Itaewon ,which has  their own characterestics. live in Seoul can have various experiences than Daejon.
          Second, there are many college in Seoul, but Daejon do not. KAIST students mostly study Industry or nature science. So meeting other students is very helpful for KAIST students. But there are not enough college in Daejon compare with Seoul. If KAIST move to Seoul, it will be easier to do interactive with other college students. I hope KAIST students meet various people.
          Finally, university in Seoul will increase the name value of KAIST. For above reasons, many korean students want to go university in Seoul.  So, In-Seoul university title will increase the value of KAIST. It wll make more people can know the name of KAIST.
          As a conclusion, I want to replace KAIST to Seoul for three reasons. there are individual reasons, but all opinion will be helpful for KAISTIAN'h happiness and pride. I want KAIST students experience many activities and culture. Daejon is also a good city, but silence city than Seoul. So, it will beb etter if KAIST replace to Seoul."	5	4	3.5	12.5
1682	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    When I first visited KAIST campus, I was really surprised that  buildings are numerous and campus is wide and  beautiful. While living in campus, I felt walking through campus costs time a lot, so  I bought a bicycle to move faster. Not only me, but nearly half of students use bicycle. However, I experienced many unconvinient moments when riding bicycle in campus. Therefore, if I could change one thing in KAIST, I would change the bicycle road system. There are three reasons why I want to change the bicycle road system.
    First, bicycle road is not well connected. KAIST has a lot of buildings, so there are many roads. However, except the big, main roads, the road is disconnected. For example, in endless road, since there are no bicycle road, I had to use the car road. However, when OLEV or other cars come behind me, I had to avoid them because the speed of bicycles are slow. Not only endless road, many narrow roads don't have bicycle road, so I had to share the road with pedestrians or cars. It's really dangerous.
    Second, pedestrians cannot distinguish pedestrian road and bicycle road. According to the traffic law, bicycles are classified to cars, so bicycle should use the car road, which is made of asphalt. It is right to locate the bicycle road between the car road and pedestrian road, and mark it as a red color. However, as you can see in KAIST campus, users and pedestrians share the road together, and the only way to distinguish is the color of the block. Therefore, pedestrians who had never rode bicycle in campus even do not know that the half is for bicycle users. In addition, when a group of people walk along together, they unconsciously use the bicycle road. Pedestrians use bicycle road  is a big problem of passing and it can even lead to accidents.
    Third, number of bicycle parking slots are not enough. As I mentioned, there are many buildings in KAIST, but not all buildings have parking slot. Also, the crowded place like dormitories or libraries are sometimes overflowed. I sometimes cannot park in the parking slot, just leaving them. When bicycles are not well arrayed, it is hard to unpark and bicycles can fall down in harsh weather. 
    In conclusion, I hope the bicycle road system in KAIST should be changed becuase bicycle road is not well connected, bicycle road is hard to distinguish, and number of parking slots are not enough. I hope the bicycle road system in KAIST is changed so that all car users, bicycle users, and pedestrians can move safely without interrupting each other."	5	5	4.5	14.5
1683	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"        KAIST, our university in Daejeon, must be very excellent science and technology oriented university in Korea. KAIST has many outstanding students, professors, labs, and research result. I delighted in take this university in freshmen year and until now. However, I think there are rooms to improve for the better school. That is interconnection within students! In addition, there are few opportunities for meeting our friends because of COVID-19, so many students take difficulty in hanging on people in schools.  I think our university should provide opportunities or events for students to meet and close each other via online or offline. There are many benefits by increasing connections of our students.
             First of all, connection of students can create synergy. KAIST has many talented student, and just connecting them open other infinite possibilities. For example, we assume there are student in major computer science and another students in major business technology management. They can share acknowledge that they learned in their course, plan to start-up, or reinforcing understanding about certain subject through different access method. Such case can be occur in many diverse regions.
            In addition, students can take their rights by connecting each other. There are many student councils and organizations for students in KAIST. However, many students don't have interest in them. Actually, student council in 2021 have not constituted by students' vote, because we have any candidates. If student councils and organization work hard for students welfare and comfort, students can enjoy better campus.
            Finally, interconnection with foreign students can provide growth of each other. Korean and foreign students take advantage by communicating. They not only learn another language naturally but also expand aspect of seeing world. Now there are some programs for communicating such as buddy, language exchange programs, but I think programs should be larger and available for much. This must be very excellent opportunity for both Korean and foreign students.
         In conclusion, I think our university should increase opportunities, programs, or events for students' communication. That can create synergy, increase students' welfare and right, and expand aspect of seeing the whole global world. "	5	5	4	14
1684	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Recently, univercities, different from high school, are recognized to public splace. Because, universities don't have access restriction and there are a lot of event for not only their students, but also for outs. In the other words, the number of floating populations be a condition for great and enjoyable university. However, KAIST's public transport is not enough to make a lot of floating populations. Therefore, I want to change KAIST's traffic condition. (public transport, region) Let me talk about reason of them.
 First, students want better traffic environment. KAIST's public transport have so many inconvenience. Subway station ,'월평' is so far from KAIST and city buses have crazy dispatch interval. This inconvenience make someone stressful who don't live in dorm and want to go home at weekend. KAIST make shuttle bus to solve this inconvenience, but it is not enough to satisfy for our students.
 Second, other people want better environment, too.When we see Seoul area unvercities, most of major university be landmark of their region. People can walk on the campus, take picture of campus, and enjoy the fresh atmosphere. Also, university and something to enjoy is always accompanied, so nearby of unversity frequently be a lot of young people's  hot place. However, KAIST also have beatiful campus and fresh atmosphere. So when KAIST improve our traffic condition, KAIST can be a Daejeon's landmark.
 In conclusion, good traffic is essential condition for great university. KAIST must improve traffic problem for make a better campus, and for in and out person of campus."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1685	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    As COVID-19 spreads out, I had to study in my home for the first semester. It was really hard for me to concentrate to my own study. Since the second semester, I could live in the dormitory. While I live in the dormitory, I felt how comfortable KAIST is to live. So, I am satisfied and accustomed to the system of KAIST. I love everything of KAIST. But there is one thing that I want to improve. That is the wifi system. There are three reasons that I want to change it into much better system.
    First, it disconnect itself often. I live in Mir Hall now. But when I went out and come back, my cellphone can find the wifi but have difficulty connecting the wifi. So, I have to wait and use my data until it succeed to connect wifi. The same phenomenon occurs to my iPad, too. It is uncomfortable to use. Even during this post test, the iPad that I joined to the Zoom link was disconnected because the wifi suddenly broke down. So I had to use my hotspot system of my cellphone to connect to the link again. 
    Second, the speed of the wifi system needs to be much faster. I had some experiences about late submission. When I had to submit the assignment rapidly, I could not submit it on time because of the wifi system. I know that I should have taken care of it and submitted it earlier. But if the speed of the wifi system was faster, I could do it on time.
    Lastly, there are some places where I can not use wifi. Except for the outside of the buildings like the roads, the sidewalks. I can not use wifi in some places of KAIST. I know that it might be just a dream that can not be realized, but sometimes I feel uncomfortable.
    To conclude, I felt uncomfortable to use the wifi system of KAIST. Because it disconnect itself randomly, the speed of it is slow, and there are some places that I can not utilize it. If it is improved, I will live and study in KAIST happily. I know that the reasons that I told might not be appropriate to support my opinion. However, that's because I felt really comfortable to use the whole system of KAIST, and it was really hard to find the point to be changed."	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5
1686	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   Everyday, I go to my university, KAIST, to listen classes or study my major.  My university has a lot of advantages that help studying such as library, dormitory and restaurant. However, It also has some kinds of disadvantages which are about location. Therefore, if I could change one important thing about my university, I want to change its location to Seoul with three reasons. 
     First of all, Seoul has a lot of comfortable system and service. In KAIST, which is in Deajeon, it does not have enough place to play or eat some delicious foods. If we want to eat some delicious foods, we should go outside very further. Also, Deajoen has public transformation more less than Seoul. Seoul has a lot of subway so that we can go anywhere in a few times. Eventually, if KAIST is in Seoul, we can go anywhere in a few times with many public transformations.
     Second, Most famous univerities in Korea is in Seoul, so we can interact with them. We have some programs that interact or exchange our students with other univerities in order to study more or develope our education systems. For example, we can interact with Seoul Univerity, Korea Univeristy, Yeonsai Univeristy and all the other universities in Seoul in oreder to exchange their students or some festivals or interesting programs a lot. It will be helful exactly. 
     Last, our univerity can develop. Seoul is a capital in Korea, so half of people in Korea live in Seoul. Therefore we can accept more students than before. Then it is sure that we have bigger education system and many professors. KAIST can be a symbol of science univerity in short time. 
    To sum up, If I could change one important thing about my univerity, KAIST, I would change its location to Seoul with three reasons. I am sure that one of the best science univerity, KAIST can develop more and more if it is in Seoul. "	4.5	4.5	4	13
1687	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   Daejeon is one of the largest city in Korea, and it is usually called 'science city' since a lot of research centers and factories are there.  My university, KAIST, is also in Daejeon. The students of KAIST can be benefited by the great infrastructure of Daejeon, but I sometimes imagine what would happen if KAIST were in Seoul. Being in Seoul should have some advantages, so if I have a chance to change something about my university, I would change the location of it. I'll suggest two reasons why I want to place KAIST at Seoul.
   First, the infrastructure of Seoul is better in general. Yet Daejeon has a well-structured infraware, that of Seoul is stiil better. For example, Seoul has a lot of subway line, whereas Daejeon has one line. This difference can affect the welfare of students. They can go  wherever they wantby subway, and any students lives in Seoul can visit KAIST with ease. Besides, since Seoul is the capital of the country, many systems and policies are applied to Seoul first. To think in innovative way, it is usually better to experience new things in the earlier stage. This can be expecially true for KAIST students. So, we can be benefited by the better infrastructure of Seoul.
   Second, we can take advantage of the diverse environment of Seoul. In addition to its infraware, the invironment of Seoul is more diverse than Daejeon. Daejeon has specialized in science, but not in the other fields. On the other hand, Seoul has specialized in culture, tourism, and researches, as well as science. Being in Deajeon, KAIST students cannot get much chance to experience such things except science. However, with the variety of experiences of students, they may show better performance in their researches, since they can generate more creative ideas with different kind of cultural experiences. If KAIST moves to Seoul, this improvement can actually happen.
   In conclusion, KAIST can be better off if it moves to Seoul, by taking advantage of Seoul's great infrastructure and diverse environment. It is true that Daejeon is a nice city, and the city helped KAIST a lot. However, it is also true that KAIST still have some potential to step up only if the surroundings were better. We should consider about this problem in a more serious way."	4.5	5	4.5	14
1688	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST is located in Daejeon. Deajeon is peaceful and quiet city. In addition, Daejeon is called science capital city since many research centers, including KAIST, are located in Daejeon. Therefore, it is the best city for research or study. However, even Daejeon is great city to study, if I could change one important thing about KAIST, I want to change the location to Seoul. I will give two reasons.
First, it is hard to communicate with other university students. Last year, I tried to join badminton club. I wanted to join united club that students from many universities participate. However, I could not find any club that I could join. Because most of universities and clubs are concentrated in Seoul, and there was no club for KAIST students who live in Daejeon. That shows that KAIST students are hard to communicate with others.
Second, it is hard to make girl friend. 80% of KAIST student is male. Hence, it is so hard to make girl friend in KAIST. I had many girl friends before I came to KAIST. However, after I came to KAIST, I faced serious problems with making girl friend. Once, I asked my friend about how Seoul students make girl friend even most of students are male in his school. He said, they can meet outside of the school because there are many people and many place to meet outside of the school. There are less places and universities than Seoul that we can meet others in Daejeon. Thus, it is so hard to make girl friend for KAIST students.
In conclusion, I would change the location of the KAIST to Seoul because of the two reasons. The first reason is communication with other university students and the second reason is making a girl friend. However, it is almost impossible to change the location. Therefore, I hope Daejeon grow larger as Seoul so students can enjoy university life."	4.5	4	4.5	13
1689	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Last month, I have visited SNU, Seoul National Unversity, to meet my old friends. I was surprised becuase the students in SNU were hanging out well with other students in the same major while the students in KAIST tend to feel less friendly with other students in the same major becuase unlike  other universities, KAIST students don't have major when they are freshmen. This kind of phenomenon in KAIST is being more severe since last year because of the COVID-19. However, I think making good and close relationships with other students in the same major is beneficial for both students and school, so if I could change one important thing in KAIST, I want to make more opportunities to make relationships with other students in the same major.
 First, making good relationships with other students in the same major is beneficial for the students themselves because they can help each other when studying. As the peer interaction is one good method for studying, asking questions and answering for them is very helpful for both students in studying. However, it is a big problem that there are a lot of students who don't have any friends to ask for some help and ask questions in the same major. Increasing the opportunities for making the relationships with other students in the same major would ruduce this problem.
 Second, makgin good relationships with other students in the same major is beneficial for the school because it can gather students into one. By doing so, students will better follow the school's various instructions because a group is more powerful than an individual when doing some actions. Also, students might love the school more than before since their satisfaction increase.
 In conclusion, making good and close relationships with other students in the same major is beneficail for both students and the school. By increasing the opportunties to make relationships with other students in the same major, students can help each other and share the informations when studying,  and the school can make students to love the KAIST, and to follow the school's instructions well."	5	4.5	4	13.5
1690	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" The final is comming, and students are busy to prepare the last and the most important schedule of their semester. So there are lots of students who study in the library, caffe, and any other places. But due to the COVID-19, many suitable places for studying is banned to use. Especially, the library is closed in the weeked to prevent the massive infection. I agreed to the policy at the first time, but as time went on, I felt that it did not achieve the inteded purpose and bought many side effects. Thus, I suggest to open the library  in the satruday and sunday during the exam period for the flowing reasons, even though it's COVID-19 era.
 First, closing policy has no effect in preventing the COVID-19 infecition. Even though the library is closed, students do not give up to study with each others. They find other sites to study together in smaller space with denser position. It vanishes the expected effect of library close. For exaple, students gather to study in the N13-1 building, so-called ""Shinhakgowan"". It's is not reasonble to ban the library only and leave other public facilities. But it is imposible to prohibit the study in every public facilities, it is more effective to open the library and take care of preventing the infecton in library. In coclusion, the library closing policy do not achieve its intended purpose.
 Second, this policy bring the unfairness in study pleces. Because of the library ban, students often go to thier club room to study during before the final term in the sunday. But those who do enter no club have no chance to study, which is not fair. For example, one of my freshman friend has no club nor room of department study room, do not found proper place to study. Of course, it do affect little to his grade. But I believe that which club or department they are registered should not cause such uneven inconvenience.
 The library close policy had beed operated to prevent the massive infection of COVID-19, it has no intended effect and cause a unfairness of study place.  You might argue that we should be pay a great attention and effort to block the COVID-19. But I would like to mention that most infection case of KAIST has occured in the laboratory, not the library. Since we cannot stop to work and stick to the dormitory, we have to distinguish which work to ban and which to allow. And I believe opeing the library during the weekend is one of the the very things to be allowed."	4.5	4.5	4	13
1691	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I'm studying in KAIST now. Although KAIST is best university, I think it exists some problems to change. One thing I want to change about KAIST is homework. So, I will talk about reasons to choose this. 
 First, homework in KAIST is a lot. Professors give us one homework everyweek. But, since we don't listen just one class, we have many homeworks to submit. For example, I can't usually sleep these days because I should write two essays for General Physics and General Chemcial Experiment in week. 
 Second, homework is so difficult. In order to solve homework, we should study about contents. However, homework is so difficult, as well as contents that we learn is so difficult. So, we should study a lot of times to know contents and solve homeworks. For example, I studied 10 hours in week in 2020 fall semester to solve Physics 2 homework. Also, because there are other subjects' homeworks, I should study without holiday. 
 To sum up, students are doing a lot of homeworks without rest. So, I want to reduce homework's amounts. And I want to make the policy to  increase gradually by raising ages. Then students can adapt and study well in our university."	5	4.5	3.5	13
1692	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   If I could change one important thing about my university, I would make program that can interact with the other university students who are not major in science or engineering. Someone can think it is not effective and meaningless, but I think that students in KAIST need to meet people who have different background with them. Let's analysis why it is important.
    First, students could find their hobby for eliminate their stress. In KAIST, there are many students who are only good at study. I think it is bad situation. When they meet people who are not major in science or engineering, they can know various thing to do and can find their hobby.

    Next, students in KAIST can grow creativity by meeting various kind of people. The statistics show that people who have great creativity generally have their own hobby which is not related to their job. ""The great idea often thought out when I was not concentrate in that part,"" Einstein said.  We could know by this two cases, meet various people and do something except analysis and study can grow creativiy.

    Finally, they can make girlfriend more easily. I have many friends who have ability to make girlfriend, but in many cases, they are solo. They get lots of stress that they do not have girlfriend for a long time. The major reason of this situation is the number of girl in KAIST is so little than boy, so they are hard to make girlfriend. Therefore, when interact program occured, they can meet lots of girls in that program and the probability of making girlfreind is increased. Finally, it can lead to reduce boy students stress level and make campus mood more positively."	4.5	4.5	4	13
1693	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Many students in our college know what we have to take a course or reach scores to graduate KAIST. And most of us generally choose the most difficult one to achieve graduating condition is physical AU. We need to take at least two of them without club activities since it requires 4 AU and each of class gives us 2 AU score. But the problem is that all of those courses has really low attending limit, so we cannot easily take it. So, some students suggest that if one go dedicate to national defence by being soldier for 18 months, then he can get 2 physical AU. I totally agree with this statement and I would like to explain why I think in this way.
 First reason is that there are increasing students who feel that the period when they work for troop is just wasting time. As alternative way in our school gets even harder to conduct, many students are considering working for national defense. Nevertheless, almost all of us do not want to go there and we even cannot take any course what we want to take in there. Thus, if we can get AU by going there, we can get meaningful result on our requirement of graduation even it is small.
 Second, we can potentially expand the attending limit of those courses. As I have introduced, it is really difficult to take physical activity courses. For me, I could not take even one of them for six semesters, even though I always have handed in that I wanted to take those courses. However, if we were able to get 2 AU from other activity, the demand for those course would be lowered and this might allow us to take them more easily.
 To sum up, I hope our college gives us 2 AU by conducting the national defends for the above reason I have explained. Even though there are some opposite opinions regarding this idea, but I believe KAIST needs to be a college which carefully hears the opinion of their students. Also, I hope our school president would consider this idea and we can get a positive outcome by that."	4.5	4	3.5	12
1694	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   I think that KAIST should reduce amount of assignment. In KAIST, students are suffered from a lot of assignment, and I am one of them. In comparison another universities, KAIST has many assignments to do. So, I will explain why I argue like this.There are two reason why I want to change amount of assignment.
    First of all, students cannot join the club activites. Many subjects have assignments every week. In order to do assignment, students give up other activites. For example, I had to do club acitivites which make a video and presentation for  introduce our club to freshman. But, I got no time to do acitivites due to assignment. So, I make worst presentation in my life. I feel really sorry to club members.
    Second, assignment are not helpful to make a good grade. Assignments are not give a big effect to grade. In major subjects, assignments take 10 ~ 20 % of final grade, however exams are take 50 ~ 60 % of final grade. In electives, exams are thake more than 60% of final grade. A few assignments are related to exam, by the way many of assignment are not test range of exam.
    In conclusion, college should have to reduce assignment to activate club and to make good grade. I hope someday, students are no suffered from assignment like me. "	4	4	4	12
1695	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     There are many electronic kickboards in KAIST. Many of students use this kickboard when they move to other class. It is because university is too large for walking. When you see the load, you can easily see that accidentical moment between car and kickboard. Actially, kickboard are very dangerous when it crash with car. It does not have any safty band, and  it just handdled by owner. So, I think kickboard should not be allowed in car zone for student's safty. 
 First, kickboard does not have any safty band. When you driving a car, the first step of driving is ""seat belt on"". However, kickboard does not have any safty belt or airpack. When you have accident with your kickboard, your body jumped into the air. This means, even if accident is small amount, your boby will damaged hard. A kickboard is not safty for rider.
 Second, kickboard's speed change fastly. Kick board's speed is connected with your pressing power. However, kickboard's pressing handle are not sensitive, so it can change its speed suddenly. This can be problem while you started or finished your kickboard riding. If you press handle before you are not perfectly on it, this will make you hurt. Also, If you supprised at crossing cars, so you suddenly decrease speed then it stops immediately. Immediate speed change is not welcome for kickboard, because you can jump into the air. 
 To sum up, kickboard is not safe for students because of these two reasons. So, I think university should restrick the rule that kickboard should not allowed in car zone. The university is too large for walking, but for the safty, you should take taxi or other riding things. Everyone in KAIST should feel safty in anywhere. "	4.5	5	3.5	13
1696	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST recommends English 100% lecture for major subject. I think major subject should be Korean lecture because 100% English lecture has many weakness. Using Korean in major lecture can make higher performance than using only Enlgish.
  First, only using English for major subject can deprive uniqueness from students. Because  we have to follow international trend, English is very important language in world. However, science need steadiness and uniqueness for research. For example, some people in Japan got Nobel prize, even though they never been to other country. Therefore, studying in Korean would improve uniqueness in academic research.
  Second, most Korean students have lower performance while adapting to English lecture. Most of major subject are difficult to understand, and English lecture for major subject is much more difficult for students. According to survey, more than 50% of university students think that English lecture in major subject has poor opportunity to discuss. Thus, allowing to teach major subject in Korean will activate discussion in class, and this will improve academic performance of students. 
To sum up, English lecture for all major subjects is not benecal because it deprives uniqueness from students. In addition, teaching major subject in Korean wiil raise academic performance of Korean students. For this reason, KAIST should add some major lecture in Korean. "	4.5	4	4.5	13
1697	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    KAIST is the name of my university. It is research oriented school.  KAIST is one of the top universities around the world, because it 
consists intellegent professors, hard working Korean and international students, and creative community. However, the work load in
is too much for both the professors and students. It is almost unlikey to see students doing other entertaing stuffs during the school
 time. I strongly believe that it is sometimes good to take time to treat yourself and your mind.  Thus, if I had the power to change 
one thing in my univesity, I would decrease the work load from both professors and students. The methods I would use are 
changing the grading system and organizing trips.

    First, I strongly believe that changing the grading system from letter grade to S/U grade would decrease the stress and work 
load from the students. From my experience and from what I heard from my friends, the main cause of stress in our school is not 
gettinga good grade even after you thought you worked hard. Moreover, after graduation the companies that we are going to apply 
do not see how hard we worked during our school, they usually tend to judge by the grade we have.  However, If our transcript is 
graded in S/U they would give us the opportunity to show them that we can do well.  Therefore, the stress and work load on us 
would decrease significatly.   
    The second method I would use is organizing trips. It is almost unlikely to see members of KAIST, students and professors,  
getting  off work. They do not have the time to explore the good thing and the problems in their community.  In addition, not 
being able to entertain your mind creates stress. However, if we could organize atleasst one trip per semester, we would get alot 
of advantages besides refrashing our mind. For example, we would be able to see the problems in our society, who lives out side of 
the campus. Therefore, we would create solutions based on our experience.  
    Finally, I strongly believe that changing the grading system and organizing trips would results an effective happy and creative 
community in our school. It would decrease stress and work load for the community. It would give the students as well as the 
professors the opportunity to see the problems of their society, so that they would have a great ideas on how they can solve the 
problems by using their academic knowlege."	4.5	4	3.5	12
1698	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    Do you think about the most important thing? I believe the most important thing about my university is health.  So, If I think about ""If I could change one important thing in my university, what would I change?"",  The answer is that maybe I will change the unexpected diseases or death. This is not complex thing.  It is that when I change one thing about my university, I should make people expect their diseases or problem of their body. Because If you can expect your diseases, you can live longer with healthier body.
    First, It help you to keep your body healty.  Almost people die because of their diseses and old body. As you get order, you have to have a hospital. This is an inevitable fact. However, If you can predict your problem, you may try to keep your health. Also, You can prevent the disease from predictable problem. As a result, It may leads you to live longer.  My parents often said me, ""Please just grow healthy, the fact that  you are good at study or spoerts is not important thing."" Actually, I was sick when I was a little boy. maybe 7 years old? I remember that time was a most frustrated time in my life. I can't remember How I got that terrible disease called Gawasaki. It made me sick, so I had to go to the bed in the hospital for a long time. I could't forget my mother's crying face because of my disease. 
    Second, According to you can expect and predict your death or diseases, You maybe enjoy your life more exciting. For example, when you play with your friends and do dangerous activity, You might worry about If you hult from this activity. But If you know the result of your future, you don't think about doing that activity such as ski jump, or sea swim. Furthermore, not just this case, You can enjoy more time with your parents.  Think this situation.  If your health has problem, and you have to go to the hospital, you shouldn't enjoy time with your people who are friendly with you. This story may be very sad.  I want to live long and enjoyable with my friends, parents, and others. 
     For these reasons, If I could change one important thing about my university, I want to predict my future diseases and dath.  Because I can ready to that problem before the diseases happen, It lead to my body keeps healthy. Also, It can lead my future more happy, and gives me more time to enjoy with my neiborhood.

1699	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    KAIST is the best science technology university in Korea. In KAIST, most of students live in the dormitories. Do you satisfy with your domitory? Well, I don't. I am living in 'Areum-gwan' and I want to change something of my dormitory. Therefore, I'd like to talk about bugs, structure of the dormitory, and the reason why I want to change them.  
    First of all, there are too much bugs in the dormitory where I live. I can see too many bugs in the dormitory, especially in summer. Bugs which are flying, or just walking on the ground, small or big make me so annoyed. If a bug come in my room, I can't sleep because I really hate and afraid of it. I think this is because of the dormitory's location. My dormitory, 'Areum gwan' is located beside a small mountain, so I want to change the location of this dormitory. If I do, bugs will appear less than before. 
    Second, I don't like the structure of my dormitory. There are many types of dormitories in KAIST. My dormitory, 'Areum gwan', don't have good structure as I think. Each room of this dormitory is too small to live with another person. It is hard to move except on the bed, and a distance of my chair and my roommate's chair is too close. Besides, a space where we come in through door and put our shoes is too big, so I feel the room is smaller than a real. Also, I want to improve an environment of the dormitory's middle garden. There is a garden at the center of our dormitory, but there is nothing except some plants! I want to decorate and put some chairs and desk to make a space where students study or talk together with their friends. Actually, in KAIST, there are various kind of dormitory. I also want to unite structures of the dormitories in order not to make any complains. 
    At last, the reason why I want to change those two is just for students' convenient. As I said, most of students of KAIST live in dormitory. Because of this, making good dormitories is more important thing than any other universities. We will not get any stress and study well if we can live in better dormitory, w 
    In short, I want to change the dormitories of KAIST, especially 'Areum-gwan'. I want to change the location not to see bugs and change the structure of my dormitory. I want all students to live in better dormitory environment. "	3	3	3	9
1700	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" Smartphones have helped communication among family and friends by many ways. I will introduce three ways how smartphones help communication among close people. 
 First of all, group kakao talk helps keeping the groups communication and activity. When there is no smart phone, it is too hard to communicate among lots of people. However, after smartphones appear, all of people in a group can tell own opinions freely. So, the group activities and communications can be more active and easier. 
 
 Next, SNS make people say hello easier. People using SNS usually posts their daily life, and also they are able to write a simple comment for other people's posting like a heart or emotion emoticons. This service makes the people who feels difficulties in communication with friends not talking with them a lot be able to send message first. 
 
 Finally, smartphones makes the call & message service free. Therefore, now, we don't care about the upper limits in the amounts of message. So, we can call or send messages anytime, anywhere, and every texts. 
 
In conclusion, appearance of smartphones help the communication among friends and family by Kakao talk application, SNS, and free call & message service. "	3	3.5	3.5	10
1701	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"As the development of smartphone, it made people's life more convenient but also it destroyed communication among family and friends. There are three reasons why smartphone made our communication poorly. First of all, people communicate with text when using their smartphone. After the development of smartphone, most of people started to use messenger like Kakaotalk. It is quite sure that messenger is convenient to communicate fast, but it interfere deep communication since we can not see each other's face or hear voices. Three point of talking is content, voice ton and face, so messenger only deliver the content. It means that we are having poor communication with messenger. Second, people use smartphone even when they are with their family and friends. In these days, we can do anything, in everywhere like internet surfing, watching videos, playing games with our smartphones.  A lot of people watch their smartphone instead of talking with family or playing with their friends. For example, we can easily see many people are watching smartphone beside friends, in Kaimaru. This cause a serious lack of communication between them. For the last, young students spend their time with smartphone. We can watch the news like ""70% of students are having smartphone addiction"". When I was young, I used to play with friends in playground after school. However, we can see that even under 10-years old students are also have smartphone these days. They are playing smartphone games in their home instead of playing with their friends outside. Many scholars suggest that the teenager term is the most important for development of communication skills. Therefore, as the smartphone develop more, a lot of young people will have a trouble with communicate since they don't have enough communication skills. In conclusion, it is true that smartphone is convenient but it is also true that smartphone caused poor communication, lack of communication between family and friends."	3.5	4.5	3.5	11.5
1702	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" Many people have smartphone these day. Because of that, we can talk to each other whenever and wherever we are. Before, we didn't talk to each other because there wasn't a way to do. I think that smartphones are helping communication for three reasons.
 First, we can communicate wherever and whenever it is. Smartphone made it able to communicate even though it is far apart. If we can access to the internet the location doesn't matter. Also, we can talk to each other even in the early morning and in the midnight.
 Second, it is easier to make some new friends. Before, we needed to meet each other to get closer. Now, we can talk online and make new friends. For example, I made new friends few weeks before going to high school by online.
 Lastly, it is able to see the conversation that had before. Because it is hard to remember everything we talked about, sometimes I forget about what we talked before.
  In conclusion, smartphones are making communication easier than before. It is able to communicate wherever and whenever it is. Also, it is easier to make new friends. Because of smartphone, it is able to see the previous conversations. For the three reasons above, I think that smartphone helped communication among friends and family. "	4	3.5	3.5	11
1703	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" I think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends with four reasons. At first, we can talk with other people by smartphones easily, so we don't have to meet face-to-face. By developing the technology about internet communication, we can not only send the message by smartphones, but also send the image and give someone the gift through kakaotalk. Eventually, we can do everything which we can only do by meeting other people in the past in the cyberspace. Secondly, when we spend time with other people, the smartphone disturbs our communication. For example, you are having a time with your friends. Then, how often you check your smartphone? Maybe, most of you check SNS and send the message to another person very often during this time. That is because you enjoy using smartphone as much as talking with people. By doing this, you can't improve the relationship with person who is in front of you. Next, smartphones make some gap among different generation. Generally, young people use smartphone more than older. So, young people know more and more language which is used in the internet. This situation effects the communication among family. For instance, children often use internet language during communication with their parents. But parents can't understand what they say, so they don't want to take with each other. Finally, in the cyberspace, you cannot make the relationship deeply. Many people talk with people who they don't know actually and they can do behaviors like sending comments or pushing the ""like"" button about someone's letter, who are not close with them. This internet culture makes light relationship and people are hard to communicate about deep topic with their internet friends. To sum up, using smartphone give us negative effects about not only our communication, but also our relationship. So, we have to meet person in reality, and reduce the useless uses of smartphone.

1704	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" Smartphone has been developed rapidly since 2010. And now, it became an essential product which stays all the time near us. In this situation, some people say too much use of smartphone can isolate the user from a real world which can be said as a background including his family or friends. However, I think smartphone certainly helps communication among family and friends for the following three reasons.
 First, smartphone is useful when people can't meet each other because of a long distance. This is very simple. We can call them whenever we want, or we can chat with them no matter where we are in. In this case, we can't never say smartphone destroys their communication.
 Second, sns connects friends who weren't in our memory. For example, I can upload my stories in facebook and  if my facebook friend sees that story, I can know that he saw my story. In my experience, I knew that my middle school friend saw my story, and was glad to meet him again although it was just through sns. So, I contacted him through direct message, and made an appointment to see him face to face. This case means sns used by smartphone makes new face to face communication.
 Third, I think use of smartphone and decrease of communication among family and friends doesn't have any direct relationship. I agree that if we are addicted to smartphone, our focus can be not in the real world, but the cyber space. However this is a really unique case. Most of people uses their smartphone to make better relationships with others or have their own hobby time. 
 In conclusion, I mentioned that there are no direct connection between smartphone and decrease of communication among surrounding people. We can use smartphone as a tool of contacting to others who are far away from us or who were not steadily reached. "	4.5	4	4	12.5
1705	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" One of the biggest inventions that had a great impact on our ives could be the smartphones. These smartphones were similar to computers as they had a lot of functions, but they were also portable that people could use them in daily life, anytime and anywhere. However, because they were too useful and too portable, people after the smartphone-generation started to do most of the things alone. These people were usually not aware of the importance of having communications with people around them. Some people might wonder why this is the result of the invention of smartphones. Only a few decades ago, like 30 years, playgrounds were one of the best place for children to spend their leisure time. Meeting peers through offline was mostly the only choice for children to use their recess time. However, nowadays, it is common for children to play with their smartphones, or visit social network services using their free time. Not only friends, but communication among family became worse. The amount of time that children and parents spend together got lessened a lot as most of the people began to use more time on smartphones. These circumstances made them not only to communicate lesser, but they also weakened the bonds of family itself. To sum up, smartphones had made our lives comfortable, but they have made people to be alone and destroyed communication among family and friends."	3.5	3	4	10.5
1706	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" 
Nowadays, we can say that smartphone is essential in our life. As smartphone became a part of our life, relationship between our family and friends become stronger. Here are 3 reasons why smartphones are helpful to our offline relationship.
First of all, the sns service in smartphone make family relationship more deeply connected. Through this service, we could know where,  when and what are they doing. In particular, the online group chat service in ""cacaotalk"" make our family feels like each of us stay in room and have conversation. SNS also provide us to keep in touch inspite of Covid 19. Through ""instagram"" we can share our normal life and have small chat with friends.
secondly, camera in smartphone allow us to record the memory everyday. When I was young, my father have to bring video recorder, film camera to record our family's history. It's quite heavy and inconvinent. But thanks to smartphone, we can take video and pictures more easly. lots of records let us throgh back to the past and have more conversation.
Finally, smartphone also have healthcare application that could take care of our parents. Most of smartphones have health senser that can measure heartrate, workout time and even stress level. This function allow us to take care of family member who is sick more easly. Or we can have a workout competition with our friends even though we are not in the same place.
In brief, smartphone make us connected and interactioned more deeply. Smartphone make us keep in touching with SNS service, recording through camera application and taking care of each other. Smartphone is getting smarter day by day, and as it get smarter, we can have stronger communication among family and friends."	3.5	4	3.5	11
1707	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"After the smartphones have developed and online communication server has made, the communication trend has moved. Now people don't talk face to face anymore, but they use message, phone call, SNS service instead. Since people are not talking each other anymore, many people argue that smartphones have destroyed relationship and communication between family and friends. I strongly disagree with those opinions with two reasons. First, the way of communication has been always changed and smartphone is just one part of it. From the past to the present, people has communicated in different ways. Long ago, people draw painting or write letters on the rock, but after they learned how to make paper, people started writing on paper and use letters to communicate in far distance. The communication through smartphone is only one way of communication that has developed as technology developed. Secondly, smartphones help the communication among family and friends in far distance. Most of people think that  talking face to face is most effective way of communication, but sometimes it is impossible. There are people who live in far distance with their family, friends in many different reasons. For them, smartphone and online platform is only way of fast communication with others. From this case, we can say that smartphones have positive effects on communication with family and friends. To sum up, since smartphone is just one part of the changing communication way, and it can help people to communicate with family, friends in special cases, I want to say that smartphones don't have destroyed communication among family and friends, but they only changed the way of communication between them."	3.5	4	3.5	11
1708	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" Smartphones had changed our lives forever. It became possible to access internet whenever we want. Many people uses smartphone all day long even if they're with their family. I'm in that case too. But smartphone have not destroyed communication among families and friends. There are some reasons.
   Smartphone shows many contents which is more fun and interesting than talking with family and friends. This can destroy and end communication. But we can prevent this by making a rule. Rules like no smartphone while having a meal. My parents made this rule and now we can talk at the table, having a meal. It is not hard to control smartphone. If someone cannot stop using smartphone, it is his fault, not smartphone's. 
   Smartphone can help communication too. I'm in Deajeon now so it is hard to communicate with my families, but smartphone made it possible. I can send a message or call them everyday thanks to smartphone. Smartphone can be a tool for communication like this. Actually people uses smartphone as a tool for communication nowadays. 
   Smartphone also gives us things to talk about. I often talk about what i saw in youtube or other internet sites with family or friends. It is good topic to talk about.
   In short, smartphone is just a human-made tool. Every tool works as just how we uses.  If we uses smartphone wisely, It will only gives us a positive effects. It's not smartphone that destroys our communication. It's just you."	3	3.5	3.5	10
1709	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"Smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends due to the following two reasons. First of all, communication among family and friends has decreased because of smartphones. People often use smartphones to watch videos or play games even when they are being with others instead of having conversations.  We can play games or watch youtube videos with smartphones. These are very fun and addictive and convenient to spend time with. So people tend to use smartphones instead of having conversations with others. Secondly, communications by using smartphones can easily cause misunderstandings between people because texting or calling lacks non-linguistic expressions. If we conversations, we not only talk but also make gestures, faces, and vary the tone. However, when we communicate with smartphones, even there are emoticons, they can't fully deliver our tend. To sum up, smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends due to the decrease and distortion of communication."	4.5	4.5	4	13
1710	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"In my opinion, smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends because of following two reasons. Before we go further, I'd like to propose two ways to measure the communication level; it is an amount of time we spent for the communication and a quality of the communication. 
First, a time. After the presence of smartphones, people likely to talk in online, not in offline. As we do many things in online these days, there are low chance to talk directly person by person. As a result, our time spend to communication have been decreased. It is also true that, we talk more in online comparing to past. But considering various factors (like non-verbal communication, voice, etc.) of communications, we may conclude that general time spend to communication have been decreased. 
Second, a quality. According to my experience, people have more qualitative talk when they talk in offline, one-to-one. For example, people talk their secrets to their friends more comfortably when they talk in offline, one-to-one situation. Unfortunenatelly, after the presence of smartphones, people likely to talk in online rather than offline, and they likely to chat light conversations rather than secrets or heavy thoughts. 
All in all, considering time and quality, I think there are sufficient reasons to conclude that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends."	3	3.5	3.5	10
1711	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" These days, almost every person uses smartphone for convenience. With smartphones, we can do almost everything all by ourselves. Since we can do most of things all by ourselves, some people say smartphones have destroyed communication among close people like family and friends. But I  don't think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends. Rather, it increases communication for several reasons.
 First, by allowing communication between people physically distant, smartphone helped us to stay  connected.  In the case of my family, a year before, I was in the high school which is far from home, and my brother was in the military. As COVID-19 was so severe, my family couldn't meet each other often. So, we usually communicated using smartphones' functions. As we can see in this example, smartphone helped my family to communicate.
 Second, informations we earned from smartphone can be sources of  communication. If family members or friends have same hobby/interest on something, if one gets a new information about it, it can be a initiating source. For example, if someone find out news about a singer, he/she would definitely tell another person who also likes that singer. These days, as main media where we look up news is  smartphone, smartphone helps us to communicate more with close people.
 Lastly, smartphones sometime offer a chance to communicate old friends or family members. As we grow up, there were many friends who went through our life. Some of them moved their house, and some of them went to different school. Just a decades ago, it was a tough thing to find old friends. But these days, as there are many social networking services operating, they sometimes offer us our old friends. Similarly, we can easily communicate cousins who can't meet often by using smartphones. With the help of smartphones, we become able to communicate our friends. So, smartphones help us to communicate our friends.
 Obviously, there can be families/friends that smartphones destroyed their communications. But, as smartphones help people to communicate with physically distant people, offer new sources for communication, and help to find and communicate with our old friends, they increase communication among family and friends."	4.5	4	4.5	13
1712	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" These days, communication among family and friends has decreased because of using smartphones for many times. Why does it cause decreasing of communication? There are two reasons. First, smartphones have a lot of contents. People can watch movies, dramas, and books by using smartphones. It is very simple to enjoy contents by using smartphones. So, instead of communication, people enjoy them by using smartphones. Second, people can contact their family and friends by using smartphones. By using Instagram, people can communicate about their life and story. So, people must not meet family and friends to share their life. Because people don't tend to meet, communication is decreased. To summarize, communication among family and friends is reduced because people use smartphones instead of their communication times."	3	4	3	10
1713	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"I think smartphones haven't destroyed communication among family and friends for following three reasons.  First,  smartphones have enhanced a new type of communication among people, such as messenger apps and social network services. Instead of talking to each other, many people choose to communicate with other people through SNS. The second reason is that some people still communicate in traditional ways. For instance, even though I use smartphones, I still talk to my friends every day. Finally, smartphones help people to share their thoughts effectively. You can simply utilize various types of media via smartphones, such as images and videos. Therefore, you can effectively communicate with other people. To sum up, smartphones haven't destroyed communication, but changed it in many ways."	4	4.5	4.5	13
1714	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" As the IT technology had been developed, the number of people who use smartphones are increasing rapidly. Smartphones are convenient because we can do things as much as the computers do, so many people buy new smartphones. However, smartphones have not only advantages but disadvantages. I think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends for three reasons.
 First, smartphones made the individualism spread widely. When smartphones were not popular, which means there were few people who use smartphones, most people communicated face-to-face one another because it was the only way to communicate. Although there were telephones, they were not convenient to use because we should use them at designated places. Therefore, people should meet together to communicate. On the other hand, as the smartphones became popular, people don't need to meet one another now. As a result, the opportunities to talk each other decrease, so we can say that smartphones destroyed communication among family and friends. Next, most teenagers prefer using smartphones to communicating one another because it is convenient and comfortable. Let's consider how teenagers think about the relationship between each other. Most of them think that it is hard to make. They are not comfortable to communicate one another because they grew up with watching YouTube or playing games, not doing hide-a-seek or riding seesaw at the playground. So, we can say the smartphones - in fact, not only smartphones but TV or such electronic devices - have destroyed communication among family and friends. Lastly, there are so many materials that we can enjoy with our smartphones. When smartphones were less developed, which means they don't have many abilities as now, we couldn't take a rest or do something with smartphones. We could only call another or send a message because those were the only abilities that smartphones could do. However, nowadays, we can do SNS , watch videos, search articles, and listen to music as much as we want. The things we can do with our smartphones are not limited.  In fact, we can do anything with smartphones for all day long. Do you know what does it mean? We don't want to communicate among family and friends because doing something with using our smartphones is more convenient and comfortable than communicating one another. Therefore, we can say that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends because of the abilities of themselves.
 In conclusion, it is true that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends. Smartphones made the individualism spread, teenagers prefer smartphones to playing outside, and people use themselves because of their abilities. It is good to use smartphones, but it would be better to make a time to communicate among family and friends. Communicating one another make you happier than using smartphones alone."	3.5	4	3.5	11
1715	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"A significant increase in usage of smartphone has destroyed communication among family and friends.  As the first reason, people spend significant time with their smartphone, and it make people spend less time with their family and friends. We can see some examples in real world that people using their phone at their dinner. Development of smartphone cause the increase of online content such as Youtube. People consume smartphone content include video without specific purpose, and the time with family and friends are decreasing as the time with smartphone increase. Second, People who have problem with long writing or conversation which is important factor to make good relationship are increasing. Since people who use smartphone are major in nowadays, the text message program became essential in our life. Message programs such as Kakao Talk or Facebook Messenger can make chat between people easier and quicker. However, if people feel comfort how to chat in such messenger, they may make people uncomfortant to do long writing or conversation because way to do conversation is different. The main point of communication in writing or speaking is to organize the topic or subject in proper length and way. Relation between people can become bad unless they use right ethics of communication. As a last reason, slag culture that caused by the increase of time with smartphone disturbing good relationship between people. Genereations who are familiar with smartphone usually use slags because of their joy. If they use slags in real world relationship in wrong way, person who conduction communication could have bad emotion about them, and it make relation worse. To sum up, smartphone make communication among family and friend worse because smartphone let people spend less time with their family and friend, feel unfamiliar with way to do proper communication, use slags in improper space."	3.5	4	3	10.5
1716	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"  The intriguing topic at hand is whether smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends. Today, many people use smartphones in their daily life. Some people claim that using smartphones disturb communication among family and friends. It is understandable why they contend smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends. However, I claim that smartphones haven't destroyed communication among family and friends for the following three reasons.
  First of all, smartphones give common topics among family and friends. In general,  we can talk about smartphone games, social issues, and others. By using smartphones, we can easily access to these information and interesting things. If we play same games or have interests in common topics with family and friend, we can debate and consider together. We can communicate more with our family and friends by using smartphones. 
  Second, smartphones increase the frequency of communicating with family and friends. Imagine you are far away from your family and friends. In the past, we could communicate with letters, calls. But now we can easily communicate by using smartphones. We can upload my daily life on kakaotalk family chatting room, video call to my friends, chat easily everywhere where wifi is available. So we can easily communicate through smartphones. This convenient makes us communicate more with family and friends.
 Finally, we can regulate using smartphones. If we want to communicate with family and friends, we just turn off smartphones and talk as usual. Smartphones don't force us to stop communication. Communication in real world is only up to us. Using smartphones give us more topics to talk, smartphones haven't destroyed communication among family and friends.
 To summarize, smartphones are the things that make us more communicate with our family and friends. Smartphones give interesting topics to talk. Also smartphones make us communicate more with our family. Smartphones don't disturb communication, we can regulate using smartphones. So I claim again that using smartphones haven't destroyed communication among family and friends. We use smartphones to communicate with family and friends."	4.5	4	4.5	13
1717	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Why people love visiting a foreign country? This must be the fact that you can get great chance to feel ""new"" thing that you haven't got. It might be different for people to choose the most valuable country. And I want to say that I must choose U.S.A (United State of America) following three specific reasons.
Frist of all, the biggest reason for this is the opportunity for using English.
In language learning, not only learning gramma and alphabets but also how to listen and speak like native person is important. And speaking and listening with real native person will be the best way to learn these things efficiently. This opportunity will be valuable for me who learn English for almost 10 years.
Secondly, I want to get experience of its culture.
While learning 'real' English, I also can get experience of its culture like festival. And because after a few weeks, it is x-mass. I watched some youtube video about festival in Time Square at 12/25. It will be the best festival in my life.   If I can get more time than two weeks, I want to stay there to get lots of experiences about other cultures.
Finally, I hope to visite MIT.
It is obvious that MIT is the one of the most world best institute of Science and Technology. I want to feel that mood and get some information about why MIT cannot help to becoming the best college. And also, for the name of KAIST (--IST), MIT is kind of role model of KAIST. This will be the meaningful reason too.
If I have chances, I want to attend class of MIT and feel the mood in the library of MIT. And these all experiences will help me to be best Computer Scientist. 
In conclusion, I said three reasons why I want to go USA for two weeks. The common thing in these reasons is that I can get valuable experiences. Choosing U.S.A will be great also any people who want to enlarge one's point of view. And I hope, next time, you will choose America."	4	3	3.5	10.5

If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would change the place of my hometown. There are 2 different reasons why I would change the place of my hometown.

First, I always go other city for some reasons. I have to go to Daejeon for going KAIST. My girlfriend live far alway from me, and I have to spend 2 hours to meet her. I wish my hometown place near the Seoul Station, so I could go other city more easily.
Next, I want to play more fun.My hometown has less hotplace. I need a hot place near my hometown to play there. My best friends are living far each other. I want to play with my friends easily.


In conclusion, I have to go other city many times and my hometown is bad place to play fun with my friends. For these two reasons I would change the place of my hometown, If I could change one important thing about my hometown."	2	2	2	6
1719	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Hometown is the place that you grew up in young ages. It is the place that has lots of good memories. But sometimes, comparing with others hometown, we wish something  about our hometown starting with 'What if ~'. To change one important thing about the hometown, I would make a KFC in my hometown. To say more about my hometown, I was born in  Incheon, Song-do. In Song-do, lots of burger franchises are in there, but no KFC.  To eat KFC, I have to ride a subway for 30 minutes.
First, KFC is the most delicious burger brand. The quality of chicken burgers are way better to compare with other brands. The patty of the burger is thicker than others and it uses 100% chicken unlike others. It seems that KFC has more know-hows about fried chicken. They are experts on it because KFC is first launched with fried chickens. Also, some burgers has very special qualities to make it more tasty. For example, Zinger Burger has no breads on it, instead fried chickens replace the role of the bun. Another example is Tower Burger which has hash brown in the burger. It makes really good harmony with other compounds.
Next, KFC is the most efficient burger brand. In my hometown, there are so many apartments, so that there are so many students. For students, things that has a lot of amount or cheap price are the most important feature. KFC satisfies with this condition. KFC's best menu, Tower Burger, has 2 patties plus 1 hash brown inside the burger. The amount is little bigger than the Big Mac. But the price of it is cheaper than it, with the better quality. You can buy a Tower Burger, french fries, a cup of soft drink, 2 chicken tenders and an egg tart, with only 10000 won.
Lastly, KFC offers not only the burgers, it sells fried chicken. As I said earlier, KFC was first started with fried chicken. So, 1 KFC shop can be a 2 roles which makes the land more efficient. Furthermore, the quality of the fied chicken is better than other major franchises like BHC. It is because KFC has more tradition about fried chickens. It started at the origin of the fried chicken, USA, In addition, it is more cheap. To buy 1 fried chicken in BHC, you need to pay about 20000 won, but you only need 12000 won for same amount in KFC. 
In conclusion, I would make a KFC in my hometown because the burgers are delicious, efficient and  it sells fried chickens, too.  When I was eating burger in my hometown, I felt something lacking. The answer was KFC. Song-do will be better place if KFC come in. While thinking about what to change about Song-do,  I found that there are only few things.  It means that Song-do is very good place to live even though, it does not have KFC. "	5	5	5	15
1720	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   When I was young, I always go to school via hill which is almost 40 degrees. Everyday I passed that way, I think 'Why establisher make my hometown on mountain?' It is very hard to climb the hill, even on everyday, to go to home. Do you have things that you want to change in your hometown? In fact, it is really hard to choice because hometown is the place where we live very long, so we are already very natural to its conditions, places, and neighbors. But, if you should change one thing about your hometown, what would you change? In this paper, follwing my starting sentence, I argue that hills should be removed on my hometown.
   Scientists said, 'Walking down through slopes is not good for knee health.' Climbing up can give you good effects such as muscle development, while climbing down gives over stresses to your knee. This means, hills on my hometown, can effect me and my neighborhoods bad ways. Even, there are many old mans in our hometown. The elders argue that they are tired to up and down this hill and feel uncomfortable. For everyone's health, it can not be a good ground structure. 
   In summer, Korea has very high temperature which is almost 40 Celcius degrees. Sun light is too strong, and also aspalt grounds emit heats. It is very hard ways to climb up hills in this conditions. We should face the slope which has high degrees everytime we go to home. After finishing climbing via hills and arriving at home, a lot of sweats is remained. There is no one who likes to go to hard ways and sweats. The hill gives us uncomfortable in summer.
   In my hometown, there are many cars that move around. Like people, they also use those hills. But, car on the hill is very dangerous to people. Driver's view is limited when the slope is changed, and in downward ways, reducing velocity of cars is not easy than normal roads. These two phenomena, limit of driver's view and hard to reduce velocity, can cause accidents that is crashing between people and cars. Even, as I said above, there are many elders in my hometown, so it could make a very dangerous situation.
   In conclusion, there are three reasons, people's knee health, uncomfortable in summer, possibility of occurence of accidents, for my arguement 'hills should be removed on my hometown.' By removing these hills, we can expect effects like decreasing knee patients, and frequency of accidents. Do all of you think about a thing that you want to change in your hometown? But in real, a sad point is, we can not change anything in our hometown unless it is a very small thing such as changing post box design, etc. Sometimes --especially in summer-- I really feel uncomfortable about the slope, but I love my hometown including this bad things. I hope all of you make minds more positive and love your hometown's own feelings itself."	5	5	4.5	14.5
1721	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"The thing that I want to change about my hometown, Changwon
    About 19 years, there are many things that I want to change like exam style, korean Education style. Also it's not except for my hometown. If someone ask me, ""What do you want to change about your hometown?"", then I will said ""I will change Changwon to good for play and enjoy culture"". In this essay, I will talk about what and why I want to change Changwon to good for play or funny city in 2 paragraph.
    First, I want to make Changwon sight beautiful. City sight is important things for play, because it can heal our mind and eyes. But Changwon doesn't have beatiful nightsight or sight because it was build for company. The line of city is straight, and some APT or house are just in circle. So this feature of city makes not beautiful city. It makes city looks really bored. Also there are not  beautiful building. For example, Seoul is beautiful because it has many beauty buildings and non-regularly building block, unlike changwon.  Changwon's city look seems boring, so this is the first reason that why I want to change Changwon to beautiful city to good for play.
    Second, I want to make some subway line in Changwon. There is no subway, only bus. It means students, who are like to play, cannot enjoy some culture or many play things. Also, they waste their time on the street, not for play. Let's suppose some case, If I want to see movie on megabox and eat lunch at Koo u - koo u. In Daejeon, we can go megabox near city hall and after movie, we can take subway to go to koo u - koo u. It takes just 15min. But in Changwon, We can take bus only, so it takes about 1 hours. So we get really tired when we play. So it makes Changwon not funny city. Changwon doesn't have subway, so we can not enough play in there. This is the second reason that why I want to make some subway to make Changwon funny.
    In brief, I want to make Changwon sight beautiful and some subway line to make Changwon be the good place for play and enjoy culture. Ater this time, I will suggest those reasons at Changwon cityhall website. I really hope Changwon be the funny city. If Changwon will be the funny city, then I want to you visit my hometown."	4.5	4	3.5	12
1722	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"You have your hometown without destroying your home town. Then you have experienced so many greaet things. But  you once wished to change your hometown into a better place. I have thinked same thing. My hometown is Pyeong-Taek. There is a great place that I think. But I really want to change the location of playground of Pyeong-Taek. The location of playground is not on the station in Pyeong-Taek.I'll talk about why I want to change the playground of Pyeong-taek using my hometown's disadvantages that  current location has or advantages of reasons why playground should be around station. 
                 First of all,  if the location is around the station, people can use trains. When people who live in other places come to Pyeong-Taek to play with their friends living in Pyeong-Taek, they should go to Pyeong-Taek. If the station is around the playground, they can easily come to there and enjoy until late time because they can take trains to go back their home. So they will spend more money to play in Pyeong-Taek since they just don't stay to save thier money.  The other advantage of using train is that  it will be easier to carry their items too. If you want to open a new shop, you should take many items that can't get in the Pyeong-Taek. 
                 Second, the current location has worse traffic enviroment. If I want to play with my friends, I'll go to playground by ""on walk"". I'm living around the station and many bus pass by my home. But, the bus that can take us to playground doesn't exist and other place too. It's very strange that any bus doesn't pass the playground. So many people should take bus and walk for 10 minutes, or only walk for 30 minutes. It is an effecient thing for every people.
                 Last, the shops in the station are getting worse and the economy of Pyeong-Taek too. 4 years ago, the playground was located around the station, so many shops were located too. Many people who have to take train to work in other places went to the station and bought or enjoyed in there. But now the playground are changed and  shops in the station were closed because the playground was changed. So people who are commuter don't enjoy passing by station so more and more the playground's shops are closed because people do not buy thier items or survice. In this way, our Pyeong-Taek's economy will get worse because of the location of the playground.
                 As you can see, there are many reasons why our hometown should change the location of playground to the location around the station. If it will be improved, as I said, many people can take by using bus or enjoy our hometown's playground, many shops will be open, and the economy of Pyeong-taek too. I really argue that the playground come back it's orginal place again.      "	3.5	3.5	3	10
1723	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    My hometown is Gwangju,  an awesome city of Korea.  I love my hometown for hundreds of reasons, but there are also some inconvenient things. One of the biggest problem is subway. Gwangju has subway, but no one uses it because it doesn't run through the centrals of city. If I could change one important thing about Gwangju, I would change the subway more useful. There are several reasons Gwangju should have better subway.
    First, it can reduce traffic jam. Gwangju is one of the largest cities in Korea. However, Gwangju does not have good public mobilities compared to its scale. Also, fluid population of Gwangju tends to be concentrated in specific region. These cause a lot of traffic jam, especially at the time when people go to and from their office. To solve this problem, Gwangju must have good subway. Bus or taxi can't replace it, because they also run on the roads with cars.
    Second, it will be a strength to call people from other cities. When people from Gwangju and Seoul plan to meet, most of them highly prefer Seoul. There are many reasons for it, but the biggest one is the subway of Seoul. Seoul has very useful subway that passes near the train station, which lets people move farther right after the arrival to Seoul. Also, they can move to all around the city with subway when they travel in Seoul. In such ways, subway has become one of the biggest advantages to induce foreigners. If Gwangju has subway like that of Seoul, it will make similar effect. By containing and spreading travelers, Gwangju can achieve balanced growth of commercials.
    In conclusion, Gwangju should have more useful subway. It can solve traffic jam, and can be an advantage to attract travelers. Then it will bring a lot of convenience and economical growth to Gwangju. Therefore, I will change subway of Gwangju more useful if I could change one thing of Gwangju."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1724	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     There are many problems in my hometown. Someone throws out garabages on the street. And someone makes some noises at the apartment.  Of course there are many problems, a car problem is the most important. Because the car problem is related to traffic jam and air pollution. Therefore,  If I could change one important thing about my hometown, then I would change a rule of cars : certain cars can only park at company's parking lot on certain day of  weekdays.
     First, this rule can prevent the traffic jam. 'Certain cars can only park at company's parking lot on certain day of weekdays' means this : cars which have the last car number 0 or 5 can only use company's parking lot on Mondays,  cars which have the last car number 1 or 6 can only use company's parking lot on Tuesdays, and so on... This rule can make commuters not to park their own cars on certain days, so they will decide to take pubilc transportation like bus and subway. If many commuters ride public transportation, then the traffic jam probelm of our hometown can be solved.  
     Next, this rule can solve a problem of praking lot shortage. By allowing certain cars can only park on parking lots, the parking lots will never be fulled. So praking lot shortage problem of our hometown can solved.
     Finally, this rule can solve the air pollution problem. Since many commuters ride public transportations, the cars on the roads decreases. So the air pollution due to cars will decrease too.
     In conclusion, we have to change rules about cars like this : certain cars can only park at company's parking lot on certain day of weekdays. This changed rule can help us to solve problems of traffic jam, parking lot shortage, and air pollution. Our hometown has a good public transportation system. There are many bus lines, and three subyway lines. So Why don't you start to ride public transportations under this rule? Then, our hometown can be better."	4.5	4.5	4	13

" Wonju In Kangwondo is best familiar city for me because Wonju is my hometown. I graduated elementary scool, middle school, and high school in Wonju also I have lived in Wonju during about 19 years. So, Wonju is the best city for me. But there are some disadvatnages in Wonju and one of that is traffic. Citizens in Wonju can use traffics such as bus and train to move to other cities. But, to move to other city from wonju is not easy because of traffic which is not developed well. There are two reasons to emphasize why a traffic in Wonju needs to be changed.
 First, there are tight time limits to move between Wonju and other cities. Several bus have time limit because time of first bus and final bus are fixed. Time limit for moving is very important because if users lose the possible time interval,  they have to uses bus of train in tomorrow. For example, the final bus for moving between Daejeon and Wonju is 18:30. If user can uses the bus only after 19:00, the user has to use the bus in tomorrow. So, the user will be busy to use the final bus. But on the other hand, in the case of bus between Daejeon and Seoul, it can be used at 0:00 as well as18:30. So, time limit for traffic of  Wonju need to be developed.
 Next, there are many cities to which buses from Wonju cannot go. There is also the limit in place where users can go from Wonju. For instance, if the user living in Wonju wants to go Kongju, the user uses first bus from Wonju to Seoul and uses other bus from Seoul to Konju. It is not easy path. If the students go to universuty in Kongju from Wonju in the morning because of admission interveiw, the path of bus will be very inconvenient for the student. Also, the process of uses two buses to go only on place is waste of time. The user may have to consume more than 6 hours although the user can arrive to the place in only 3 hours if the user uses their won car. So, the number of cities to which people can go from Wonju need to be increased.
 In conclusion, developed traffic is required for development of Wonju. A limit of time for using the bus makes movement of users be more inconvenient. Bus users cannot go to other cities in morning or night. Also, a limit of place makes the movement require too many time. If user should use two buses for arriving place where they want to go, it is too waste of time. According the two reasons, traffic in Wonju have to be fixed and editied. Traffic is the most important bridge between two cities, so Wonju's traffic will trigger the growing of many parts in Wonju if the traffic is edited. Thank you for reading the essay. "	5	4.5	4.5	14
1726	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  Today, almost everyone can access to the internet. We can see what other countries doing or how they live whenever we want. There are also a lot of reports or essays about them. These are, of course, good phenomena but they also brought the seed of conflict. As we now know how other countries live, people started to compare our own culture with others. Discussions have been made to rethink about our culture. Someone says we need to change, while others say that is our tradition. Because I am in the younger side, it is likely to support the changer's opinion. Among the things that we felt it needs to change, if I could change one thing, I want to change the strict atmosphere about age. We are going to see why with 3 reasons in this essay.

  First, overly-strict atmosphere about age abandons discussions. There are lots of situations that people need to talk and think a lot with all members of certain groups. But some old people or even some young people treat younger people as their opinions are nothing because they are young. They say this is our tradition. But no. Age doesn't determine the value of arguments. I could understand why those traditions were made, because like 5000 years ago the elder was those who had all knowledge. But it's 21st century. Everyone can access to all kinds of data. We need to change now.

  Second, those who aged without getting wise use this atmosphere to support their reckless opinions. There are so many people nowadays so some people might not have ability to think in a logical way. They should listen to other's opinions and practice to make opinions that make sense. But, this culture makes them to not to practice. It makes them to spit out their poor thoughts, and makes them think they are right because the listeners don't argue due to the age difference. This is one of the most terrible thing made by the culture.

  Lastly, this tradition makes people to obey to the older ones. Due to the culture, we have very strict 선배-후배 relation. I don't even know what we should call '선배-후배' in English. Of course if someone's performance is superior, we would look up to him/her by our wills. But, in Korea, the elders, even they are just one year older, forces to look up to them. This is total non-sense. We need to break this culture as fast as we can.

  To sum up, if I could change one thing about my country, I would like to change the strict atmosphere about age. This atmosphere refuses any discussions between young and old. Second, those who are old use this culture to support their opinions. Lastly, this tradition makes people to look up to the older ones without logical reasons. Now, we're in 21st c"	4.5	4	3.5	12
1727	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     Have you ever lived in a city under development? I'm living a town under development, Maseok. Most of people think that living in a city under development will have a lot of new infrastructure and be comfortable. But in reality, it is not ture. The subway is far away, and there are not many buses going to Seoul, and there are only small restaurants and cafes nearby. Among these problems, I want to suggest most important thing to be changed with several reasons. It is infrastructure. Let's findout some reasons.

      First, there's nothing to play with. There are many good places to take a walk, such as parks and rivers, but it is hard to find movie theaters and cafes. There is disadvantage that it is difficult to access book cafes or various entertainment activities, which are recently popular. Even paks and rivers that currently exist are only used for walks becuase of Covid - 19. Since there is nothing to play like this, students from nearby middle and high schools can see them play near the station by taking the bus to play after class. Therefore, more diverse infrastructure is needed.

     Second, It's hard to deliver. As Covid - 19 continues these days, the number of people ordering delivery has increased significantly. I'm one of them, and my house is quite far from the stroe I want to deliver. Therefore, there are frequent situations where delivery costs are very high, or even delivery is canceled. Do you know how sad it would be if the delivery was canceled when I ordered it because I was hungry? Not only are I'm sad, but I often waste time and eventually skip meals. This applies to other people. It is essential to build a restaurant infrastructure for everyone's health. 

     Last, since the infrastructure is not properly established, the advantage of promoting is not clear, so new people do not gather. This is the biggest problem. Since there is no play or various infrastructure, there are no people coming in and there ar not many people, so the government is not very interested in urban development. This vicious cycle is repeated. Therefore, it is necessary to start bringing in new infrastructure and break this cycle. 

     In conclusion, I think chainging infrastructure is essential for our hometown. There are three reasons. There is nothing to enjoy, delivery - related problems, and no tenants. What would happen to the city if there is only demand and no supply? Eventually, it will collapse through a vicious cycle. Therefore, it is urgent to change infrastructure. "	4	4.5	3.5	12
1728	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  My hometown is a good city. It has parks, markets, hospitals, and good educational infra. However, it has also negative things, in specific, public transfortation. In this paper, I'll talk about why I would change the transfortation system in my hometown.
    First,  my hometown doesn't have subway. The subway is very convenient transfortation because it doesn't have traffic. So If I use subway, I'll be on time to meet friends or other meeting. But my hometown only has buses, and there are no many buses. In addition, they may not be on time at bus stop since there are traffic. So, it is hard to move to other region in my hometown. 
    Second, my hometown only have one bus terminal to go out the city. Therefore, people who live in far from bus terminal are hard to move to other cities. In addition, it has only one bus terminal that is small, so the number of buses are small too. So, if the number of people who want to go some city increase, they can't go at same time. For these reasons, my hometown should have other bus terminals.
    In conclusion, because it has no subway and one bus terminal, I would change the transfortation system in my hometown. If my hometown has subway and other big bus terminals, it'll have more convenient transfortation system."	3	3	3	9
1729	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"          There are many social probelms in  Korea like generation problems or economy, etc. When I was in high school,  I felt that personal education like going to academy is quite recommended to get a good grade for entering to University. For solving this probelm, the worker who works at school not teaching needs to be increased. If I could change one important thing, I would increase that workers. It could also solve other social problems. Then, how can it solve the problem? 
          First, we have to know why personal education is recommended. It can make that the class quility at school will be higher than before. Teashers are too busy for doing other works to focus on their class, and the workers can do the work from teachers. Then, teachers can focus on their class, so the class quility will be better. If the class quility at school is better, most of student will not need personal education. If the class quility at school is better, they will find that school class is enough to get a good score at an exam. So, thay won't need need personal education like academy anymore. 
         Additionally, it can solve other social problems. It can make that specific location which is good for personal education like Gangnam get a lower price than before. The location will lose their advantage. So, the price will be lower. Furthermore, the many student will not give up math. One of the reasons of that is that most students learn mathematics unappropreate on their age too early at personal education. If the class quility will be better at school, most of students will not give up math.
         In conclusion, it can solce the many problems. I hope that most of student think education at school is enought. It will be the solution."	4	3.5	3	10.5
1730	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Nowadays, many factors determine town's value. Quailty of atomosphere, landscape, and facilities are important for determine hometown. However, the most important factor is transportation system. I will make direct subway route from my hometown to Seoul. There are two reasons why direct subway route is important.
 First of all, transportation system dicide price of house. If there is way to go Seoul fastly than other region, that region's real estate are more expensive. Also everyone heared that if the subway station is appear, price of house rise quicly. Transportation system is important because people can go office easily. Time is very import for korean because  everyone want 'fastly'. It is true that we couldn't consider time too much, but Korea will not allow. If price of our hometown is increase, hometown's people will be happy.
 In addition, transportation system bring many other system. This can be side effect of first reason, but it is different because it is also another considerable factor of region. Mosf of people don't like countryside not only for transportation but also for medical, leisure, market system. Nowadayse human always get support of various system. If someone loves food, restaurant system is important. If someone sick, medical system is important. The effect of supporting system dicide quality of life. Good transportation system like subway route reinforce all other system because of money. Management of system knows that traffic is more easier, more people visite that region, so they can get more money. If direct subway route from my hometown to Seoul is appear, everything in my hometown will be better.
 Two reasons of why direct subway route from my hometown to Seoul is best change of my hometown. One is price of house, and another is system. This wish is hard to be real, but it is not that fantasy."	4	3	2.5	9.5
1731	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"My hometown is Seoul, Mangu. It is located in the boundary of the Seoul.  So even though Mangu is in the Seoul, it has not only city-like features, but also country-like features.  Some country-like features such as mountains and parks are really good. But the other, such as poor traffic system is really bad. If there is a chance to change one thing in my hometown, I'll use it to make more subway trains and stations.
      First of all, there is only one subway station named 'Mangu Station' in my hometown. Fortunately, I live near the station, so I can go anywhere in seoul easily. But unlike me, there are many people who don't live near the station. for those people, it is really hard to go other place in seoul by subway. Also, in Mangu, there are even more old people than the other regions. For them, it is even much hard to go to the station. Some old people who walk 10km to the station make me really sad.  If we make another subway stations in Mangu, probably many people could use it much more convinently. 
      Second, for all people who use the station,  the period between trains is too long.  In Mangu, there are 2 subway lines named 'Jungang' and 'Kyeongchun'. Unlike other subway lines, those 2 lines have extremly long time period between trains. The Jungang line's train usually come in 20 min-term, and the other come in 30 min-term.  It means that if a person arrived in the stationonly  1 min late,  he or she needs to wait for 20~ 30 min.  It is fair that a late pesron needs to wait, but not that much. If there are more trains, the time period between trains may decrease shorter than 10 min, which is fair and like the other lines in the other stations do. Also, especially for old people, they usually have some stuffs to carry their home. But by the long time period between trains, more people ride in a train, and the sad things happen. People who need to sit and rest because of lots of stuffs can't sit down. By making more trains, these problems can be solved. 
     In conclusion,  making more subway lines and station can make my hometown's life better. For an any person, walking and waiting for long time in hot summer and cold winter might be dangerous for one's health.  especially for old people, it can worse their health permanantly. On the other hand, every people who use subway  system may live their life better, faster and  more convinient. In short, making the stations and trains can satisfy large portion of the population. So, probably, it can be good things that can happen in my hometown.  Like this,  even though some decision can't satisfy every people,  it should statisfy  large portion of those. "	4.5	3	3	10.5
1732	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"First, If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would add some place that I can play funny with my friend and sell tasty food. I live nearby train station. There are many stores and restaurtant. But, they are not interesting to me. For this reason, When I play my friend nearby my hometown, I'm unsatisfyed because there are no place to play with. Therefore, I will add some interesting place such as PC room or place which I can play bowling. Also, I want to add some restaurant whose memu is cheap and has good taste. Because I like eat some delicous food, I spend a lot for buying some snack. But, there are not good food stores which sell memu I want to eat. So, I want to add some food stores that I like.
Second, If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would clear from trash. When I walk nearby my home, there are so many trash on the road such as snack pack. they are nothing if they are one-by-one on road. but,   people trash on road many time, my hometown looks bad than we don't. Many people think 'It's ok. Only I trash on the road.'  So, I want to change some rule about trash or people's thinking about trashing. Then, I can see some clear hometown than before."	1.5	2	3.5	7
1733	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I will change the design of apartment. There are three reasons in my opinion. 
 First of all, The shape and color of my apartment are very similar. For example, In my case, the apartment that I live is composed of 16 floors. Next to my aparment, the other apartment is also 16 floors apartment. The color is ivory and the shape is tall and thin. So it might be a problem is that only clear standard to distinguish each apartment is the number of apartment. I think that it is too plain to feel refreshing for living people and visitor. In my hometown, there are many similar design and color of apartment. It makes people be boring to see and find each apartment. Also, all same shape of apartment can make people who want to find some apartment confuse in my hometown.
 Second, the apartment is very expensive but it is not good design. So, I think it is not responsible in terms of affordability. Of course, my hometown has a lot of useful facailities and convenient traffic situation. But It is so expensive compared to the boring and simple design. It is necessary to make different characteristic design for each apartment. For example, it might be the different colors and pictures of outside. And it could be a good idea that express the number of apartment in artistic perspective. Additionally, I want to make each special point for apartment. So, it will be a great turning point that compose our hometown.The attempt for designing apartment will make the hometown look better.
 Third, It is time to fix and remodel each apartment. Nowadays, new apartments and new schools are built in my hometown. Additionally, new faculties are built in these days. So I'm sure that it is best time to repaint our apartment. Many people that live in our hometown think that it is time to remodel the apartment. Also we have to make different something to clarify new apartment. Definitely, it is best opportunity to repaint and fix our apartment because remodeling for apartment is necessary.
 Therefore, for these three reasons, I will chage the design of apartment if I could change one important thing about my hometown."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1734	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"How long do you take a subway in a week? If you have a car, you don't have to take it for a long time. However, almost of people don't have a car like me, take a subway when we go to little far. If I could change one important thing in my hometown, I would build a subway station near my home.
 First, in my case, I have to walk and take a bus for almost 25 minutes when I go to subway station. It is so uncomfortable. Sometimes the distance of taking a bus is more long than taking a subway. I don't mean that our subway is uncomfortable. I agree that it is very useful when we have to move between hometown. But, think about it, If you go for meet your friends, you always take a time twice because the route to the subway is so long. In our hometown, there is a region famous for academies like Daechi-dong. If the traffic to that region improves, it will help develop the hometown. So, the number of subway stations in our hometown is increased, we will be able to develop further based on good transportation. 
 Second, It can help to protect environment. The reason that we use public transport is for saving environment by reducing car exhaust fumes. In my hometown, because of distance between home and subway station, lots of people using taxi for saving a time. If there are more subway stations in my hometown, they don't need to take a taxi to go to subway station. Then we can decrease the fumes from taxi. It can be very small effect for saving environment, but everything starts with something small.
 In conclusion, I want to build more subway statoin in my hometown. If we increase the subway station, the transprotaion in our hometown is improved. It can help our hometown developed. So, we have to increase subway station"	4	3.5	4	11.5
1735	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"The most thing I would like to change is ""Sleeping"". In specific, I will not only change but also eliminate that the most unneccesary human behavior, the sleeping. Also there is no tireness either.

For the first reason, The efficiency is important.
Have you considered how long do we sleep in entire life? According to WHO report, It assure that human must have slept at least 7 hour per day. Considering expected life long in these days is about 80 to 90 years.
It is surpriseing that we take at least 180000h(~= 7*365*80) in life time. We can do studying, listening music, or anything you want in that time. That time can be filled more valuable activity. 
Therefore, sleeping is time-wasting behavior.

Second, Tireness.
Person is designed to be annoying and sick, if having lack of sleeping time. I have no doubt that we all have some experience of tireness, expecially an exam period or when tomorrow is due date. 
If there is no sleeping, we do not have to endure this painful time anymore. Moreover, you can study and do something in clear mind and more healthy body.

Lastly, For people who suffer from sleeping.
There are some people who have a hard time in sleeping. For example, one of my friends takes medicien every night to get sleep. And I have a scaring memory of nightmare.
These physical or mental pain can be gone if we don't have to sleep.

The sleeping must be deleted for these three reasons.
Human being can get more efficient and  fullfilling life without sleeping."	3	1.5	2.5	7

"I want to change the place where my university is at. If I could change the place where my university located at, I would change the place, Daejeon to Seoul. There are 3 reasons to support my opinion.

The first reason is that I could go academy to improve my poor subject like English and Writing. I want to improve my poor score. Seoul has many good academies than Daejeon. So, I would get more score.

Next, we could play at hot places when we have a break time. A lot of hot places are located at Seoul. Many people are play in a hot places in a Seoul so I could meet lots of people new. I think it will be more fun to play at Seoul than at Daejeon.

Finally, my hometown is near in Seoul. I could play with my hometown friends during semester. I could even stay at home and live with my family. Most important thing is that my girdfriend is living at Seoul. I want to meet my girdfriend more frequently.

There were 3 reasons why I want to change the place where my university is at, Daejeon to Seoul. Seoul has more good academies, more hot places, and Seoul is near my hometown. Thank you for reading my writing. What do you want to change one important thing about your university?"	3.5	3	3	9.5
1737	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I agree that KAIST is perfect school but there is some things to improve with the system. To graduate in KAIST, there are lots of things to satisfy. One thing  is P.E. AU. It means every students have to  take 2 or more P.E. class  to graduate. I don't think this rule is a problem, I think P.E. is very important class for students so this is essential. The problem is that there are  so little classes opens in a semester. So I want to change this thing.
First of all, It makes students to graduate harder. This is fundamental reason of it. This year, there was so much students to listen this class so some students who are graduating semester, even didn't take the course. It made students to graduate 6 months later. It is a vert big thing that the lifecycle delays about 6 months in 20+ year old  students.
Another thing is that we can't take other courses that we want. In KAIST, we randomly get the courses for we have applied. Because of the mentioned problem, many students apply P.E. class for every semester. But, these courses are 3 hours class  not 1.5, 1.5 hours class than can occupy a lot of space in timetable. So this problem resulted students to make their timetable difficult.
These are reasons of why this problem is a thing to improve. Now I'll talk about the solutions. I suggests 2 solution. 
First solution is most intuitive solution, just making lots of classes and lots of student to take in a 1 course. I think this can help students. Even more, it can make a variation of classes. I think we don't have various subjects in KAIST. This can be another benefit/
Other solution is military AU. If we make it, students who went military can be  satistfy graduate rules. Then there will be less students to take course and it will solve the problem. Furthermore, it will be very big benefit to students who go to military. 18 months not studying and working at army is very big  loss to students plus the country.
In conclusion, I sensed the thing  that P.E. classes are too less in KAIST is a big problem  because it makes graduate difficult and it can effect other courses. So I suggested 2 solutions,  simply making more classes and military AU. I think there are more problems in KAIST even KAIST is very good university. Finding problems and thinking about its solution will be very beneficial to KAIST and others."	5	4	4	13
1738	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If i want to buy electronic products or any other things that university shop doesn't have, i must walk long way. But KAIST dormitory is quiet far from big market, if i walk to go to big market, it takes 20 minutes to walk, 10 minutes to ride a bike. Also, even though there is university cafeteria, sometimes we want to eat other foods like chicken, hamburger, soup etc. But if i go to outside and eat launch, it takes almost 1 hour. That means who has class before 1:30 can't go out to launch.
  For these reasons, i wish our domitory is near the out of university."	1	1	2	4
1739	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    If I could change one important thing about my university, I'll change our university's character that we called 'Nupjuk'.Many Korean universitys' have their own logo and character. For example, Yonsei Univ, Chungang Univ, etc have their own logo and character.  We can check this fact at KAIST. We have our logo and character with blue color. There are many words and rumor about character of our university. So today I'll talk about why we change our character.
    First, Our character is too ugly. Many students said 'That is too disgusting.' 'What is that? Really?' about 'Nupjuk'. It means 'Nupjuk' is not cute. I think we should make our character more cute and more KAIST. This is first reason why we change our character.
    Second, It doesn't have any meaning. For example, Korea University's character tiger, It is meaning korea. And Yonsei university's eagle means freedom. But there is no any meaning in Nupjuk. We don't know why Nupjuk is our university's character, and its meaning. We should make our character more scientific. This is my second reason why we change our character.
    Lastly, It takes someone's chance. I can't understand why KAIST spent 100,000, 000 won to make Nupjuk. That is not good choice. I think our university's students can make charater better and cheaper. That is money flex and uncorrect. That money should be fund for our student's study. So I think Nupjuk take some student's chance. If that money fund for someone, we don't know he'll get NOVEL prize. So this bad character should be disappeared.
    In brief, there are three reasons why I change Nupjuk, our character is too ugly, it doesn't have any meaning, and it takes someone's chance. I really hope our university change our character. If I can change character Nupjuk in real, I think our university hell students' contest, 'Making our character'. Thank you for reading my words."	4	4	2	10
1740	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"When I get an ability to improve our university, I will the limit of a lecture course.
Have you ever failed to take a lecture that you want to take because many people wanted and choosed it?
I wanted to take a course 'brain, sight, art', but I couldn't do that. 
Although I know there are reasons that we can't take a course that we hope to take, for example, it's hard to control students, I think we should make students take any course that they choose.
I'll talk about why we should change the limit of a lecture course.


 First reason is that students can develop their ability. Each student has different concerns, so they want to take different course against other people.
When they take what they hope to take, they will improve their skills. Then, our society will be better since many people can work using their improved skills.
To do this, students can choose and take an  interesting lecture for them. 
 Another reason to change the limit is that it's our university's direction. Our university get students choose their major whenever they want.
This is because they will get work better when they are in their interesting workplace and its meaning is that we(university) give you(student) a right that wherever you wish to go.
But the limit of a lecture course doesn't identify their goal. Our university should change this issue. 

 In these reasons that the change of the limit can improve our society in future and is the same thing that our university's direction,
I hope to change the limit of how many students can take a course, so whoever want to take couse can do it."	3.5	2.5	3.5	9.5
1741	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I will make physical education classes to be lectured more in KAIST every semester.
 First, it helps students to become healthy. Students in KAIST spend most of their time doing their studies or assignments with sitting whole time, so they have little chances to exercise. By making PE classes more often, we can give students more chance to do more exercise.
 Second, it is more fair. I sometimes use Everytime, a internet community for college students. I can see some writings there, that they failed to take part in most lectures they aimed. This problem is more often at PE classes, because it is available for very little amount of people. It is serious problem because all students have to listen to PE lectures to graduate. Lecturing PE classes to more may be one solution of it.
 Third, it can relieve pressure of study. Students can relieve their stress by enjoying outside activities. Also, there is minimum amount of classes students must listen each semester in KAIST. By giving opportunity to fill some amount of lecture with PE classes, they can feel more free to set their timetable.
 I think PE classes should be lectured more in KAIST. It is more fair, and it can make students more healthier and happier."	2	2.5	2.5	7
1742	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I want to make a new grading rule : grade every math and science subjects for freshman(calculas, gener physics.. etc) with S and U, not with ABC.
Nowadays, due to corona virus, some courses in KAIST examine students with S or U system. Someone says, students don't study hard under the S/U system. I understand that worry. But when it comes to  freshman,  I think S/U system has  more advantages than disadvantages. I thinks this grading system should last after the corona virus for these reasons.  
Fisrt, this system will help studenst adapt to KAIST well. In Korea, there are many types of highschool. Science high school have learnt university science and math classes so they can easily get A grade. However, students, graduated from generl high school, haven't learnt them, so they feel tough to get A grade. Under the S/U system, students from science high school will feel free to help students from generl high school, and they can grow up together. However, under the ABC system, students will compete and they won't help each other.
Second, this system is helpful to get higher GPA. For example, think about a student whose major is physics. If his GPA became lower due to General Biology class for freshman, he would be upset. Subjects that are not major subjets can block students' future. To prevent this happening, S/U system is necessary.
Finally, studenst shoude study hard under the S/U systems too. I told that someone says students don't study hard under the S/U system.  However,  if the S cutline of absoule grading ccriteria is high, students have to study hard too. So don't worry about that.
Until now, I introduced adavantages of S/U grading systems. I'm not saying that every classes in KAIST should use S/U grading. I only want some specific classes for freshman use the S/U grading. This policy will help freshman experience many general subjects freely and effeciently than before. "	3.5	3.5	2	9
1743	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"University is the place to learn which several students want to learn. That is, university is the place to make futures of each students by learning many things.  But, any universities have their problem which make students feel inconvenient. Our university has it, too. So I want to change one of this problem: establishing the bookstore for student in university. Before  about 1~2 months, unique bookstore in our university is disappeared. The name of bookstore was ""Dream Books."" After Dream Books was disappreared, students should get the book by online bookstore such as yes 24 and Amazon. Because of three reasons, I think that the bookstore is needed for our universty
  First, the bookstore in university reflects class in their university. We can find various books for one class although we want to only ane book noticed by professor. For example, if we search ""general chemistry"" book on the internet, we can find various books such as Cambell's general chemistry and Zoomdal's general chemistry. But in the case of universty's bookstore, we can find only one kind for our class. For example, during the spring semester in 2021, I went to the Dream Books. And when I only said name of book to person who sell the book, he found the book that I wanted. It was very convenient.
 Second, the bookstore in university sell books which is rare in Korea. Our university uses books estabilished in other countries, because most of class is english lecture. So, the online bookstore that sell book from other countries is not common. Moreover, some books are not found in Korea, so we have to use foreign online service such as Amazon. But it is very expensive. If bookstore locates in university, we can find the book in class handly. For example in the fall semester in 2021, in Dream Books, I could found the book for class which hard to find in naver.
 Finally, studnts can purchase the book used in class rapidly.  As I said before, foreign books are used in our class. So, the time for delivery is longer than other Korean books. But if we can use the bookstore in our university. We can purchase it rapidly. For example, in the 2021 fall semester, I got the books for general biology class from Dream Books as soon as the first class  is ended. Only about 30 minutes was took for getting it. Bookstore in university can help students prepare the class rapidly.
 According to three reasons, I agree that bookstore in our university is needed. It can reflect lectures in our universty. Moreover, it can help student get book eaasily and fast. University is place where help to students learn things for their carrer. And bookstore also one of mean to help them, too. I hope bookstore for our university to estabilished to help learning and life of students."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1744	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     I can't imangine college life without covid-19 anymore. Before I come to dormitory, I espect usual collegue life. However, It was just hope. I can't get out often and I'm living in concern. So, if I can change one important thing about my university, KAIST, I want to remove covid - 19. There are three specific reasons.

     First, I want to take a offline class. Because of covid - 19, all class in KAIST changed to online class. And I think this online class has refrained student's concentration. In online class, student can turn off their camera. Then professor didn't know what is student doing during class. Also computer provides many other programs to play. For example, youtube, instagram, facebook, etc. This programs decrease student's concentration during class. Actually, many of my friends often go to sleep or do other assignment during camera-off classes. I think this is very serious problem.

     Second, I want to use infrastructure of KAIST like library, health club more efficiently. Now I can use library until 6 p.m everyday. The situation of health club in other dormitory is same. I can't stay longtime any building because of covid - 19. I was very excited before enter the KAIST because I had heard that KAIST library is the best. As I heard, library was fantastic. There are many expert book with a lot of section and place to study. Everything in library was clean. But I can use only few time. I was very disappointed about this. 

     Last, I hope club activity by removing covid - 19. There was some issues about other club because of covid - 19. Some clubs didn't comply safe rules about covid - 19 and that clubs had criticized. I think It was club's fault too. But if there is no covid - 19, we can already enjoy club activity freely. I'm very frustrated with this situation. 

     These three reasons are explaining why I want to remove covid - 19. I hope finish this situation soon."	3	4	3	10
1745	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I would change the location and number of restaurants in my university. Eating things is very important because it can give energy to study or activity for campus life. But we can't go out for a long time due to take lecture, so location of restaurant is important. 
My university has 4 restaurants, they are usually located near by dormitories. It is good to students who live in dormitory and don't go out far. However, the students who graduated college and research in university now, they are usually in same building that is located far to dormitories. For example, in case of chemistry research building, I walked 10~20 min to go there and there are just one restarant(Subway) around that. If they want to eat other kinds of meal for lunch or dinner, they have to walk for a long time! 
So I want to change the location of restaurants. First, we can need more restaurants. There are many dormitories are located in north, but we have just two restaurants. In lunch time or dinner time, we wait for a long time. In fact, in Kaimaru, we can't eat a meal at lunch time because there are so many people. If we have more than 3 restaurants, it will be solved.
Second, we have to build more in university. There are many students and professors, but there is just one restaurant near by research building. If they can have other kinds of food easily, they can concentrate to thier research. 
I introduced the what would I change and its reasons. I think eating is very important think for everyone. I hope that all of people in my university can eat well."	3.5	4	3	10.5

Students must usually get in to the dorm.  When I used dorm, I felt uncomfortable. I think the dorm has to be improve . 
 Why do we have improve our dorm?  I think when we are in the dorm, we have to feel comfortable, because if we are not comfortable in the dorm, we would be tired outside and couln't pay attention for studing. For healthy campus life, we have to imporove our dorm. Then, hwo can we improve it? Their are some reasons to make dorm uncomfortable.
 First, their tools are old. For instance, washing machines and dry machines are old, so when I wash my colthes, they don't dry becuase of old dry machine. Air conditrioner is not working well too becuase it is old. So I think some old tools have to be changed. 
 Second, bathroom is far from room. It is so uncomfortable point. We have to go out from the room when we would do something with water eventhough that work is simple like washing hands. I think it would be hard, but I hope that bathroom is in the room.
 The last, we don't have privit space because of roomate. I think this point, some people don't agree. But I think students need their own place. However we don't have any place which we use alone becauseof roomate. So I think we need to chance to choice that we use the room alone or use with roomates.
  When above things will be improve, the dorm would be very comfortable."	3	3	2.5	8.5

In this paragraph, I will show two reasons of  'why more lecture leadership 3 is good for student'. 
 First of all, it can grow another ability. Nowadays, we have to make various ability for survive because world is changing more compilcated. Lecture leadership 3 is perfect for add new ability. For example, in <photoship/illustrater one step> , student can learn about design image. They can make card news and poster by photoshop and illustrater, so lecture leadership 3 can grow another ablilty well. If there are more lecture and student can choose more than one, their ability will get bigger.
 Next, it can care mental of student. Many of our school student are tired because of a lot of study. Lecture leadership 3 is good medicine for student because leadership 3 teach about music, drawing, and activities.

"What would youd change if you could change on important thing about your university? If I could, than I would change the quality of our dormitory. I thought this reason by these following three reasons.
The first reason is, at our school dormitory, it has a few good place dormitory to choose. For example, the area where is close to cafeteria, then it is good merit for student to live in. But, it is very limited, so the students who want to live at there, then they have to win at random choosing system. If there was the dormitory with a lot of room, then it can be better for students.
Second, students who want to exercise at gym, then a lot of students have to go to another dormitory where gym is in. This can waste the student's time, and the people could collect at gym in specific time. Then, not only it is hard to exrcise, but also it is dangerous from virus. The more buildings with gym can solve this problem.
Finally, a lot of dormitory has one bathroom in one floor and small room to use. Students who want to use bathroom, then they have to go our their room, walk down then they could reach to bathroom. Also at room, it is hard to live comfortable their student's stuff, because is is too small to live enough.
For these three following reasons, if I could change one important thing about my university, I would change the quality of our dormitory."	3.5	3.5	3	10
1749	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I would change its location Dajeon to Seoul. The following is the reasons supporting this opinion.
First, Seoul's transporting system is much comfortable then Dajeon. I lived is seoul since I was born, and this year I went to my dorm and lived in Dajeon for 4 months. To be honestly, People can go anywhere in seoul taking less then 1 hour by (9+A )subway lines and bus system. But in Dajeon, there is only one subway line. Also, when I go to dajeon stop from my dorm, it takes longer then 1hour even though it is not that long distance. If I went to a place which distance is same as from my dorm to Dajeon stop, it might take 30 mins or less. So, I Think Seoul is more appropriate for people to gather from everywhere in korea then Dajeon.

Second, the population of people who live near Seoul  is bigger then  the population of people who live near Dajeon. 350 students were in science high school, and it is almost half of the entire population of students who enter KAIST2021. And Let's think about science high schools near Seoul. There are 3 science high school near seoul which names are 경기북-science high school, Hansung science high school, and saejong science high school. If we sum the population of students who came from these schools, we can conclude that more then 100 people live near seoul. But in near Dajeon, there is only 동신- science high school and no more. So, by these calculation, I think the large portion of our students live near Seoul. Furthermore, for these students, Seoul is more appropriate to make a university then Dajeon.

I didin't mention but there are lots of reasons why Seoul is appropriate for our university. For many sudents' happy university life and comfortable transporting system, I wish my university to move Seoul of it is possible.

1750	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I have my thing that I want to change such as my enviroment, domitory, and money I have to give to my university. But I cannot change everything I want to change easily. So, If I have power that I can change one important thing about my university, I wound change the way we can move around kaist fast than walking.
I think my university is so big that I can’t find where I have to go. Also, It spend a lot of time to walk there.  Although we can use bus  that move in kaist, It is not useful and I think it spend more time. So, I want to make bus more useful than now and I want to reduce time that move around kiast. The way that make us to use bus  often is reducing the term between bus and make easy to approach bus information such as what time bus go. It make to reduce time and we can use bus easily then before. 
The other way that move around kaist is quickboard and bike. The quickboard and bike is comfortable because we can use everywhere in kaist  easily. So, Many of us like to use it than bus. But, I think Both have some disadvantage. First, quickboard and bike is too expensive to buy it easily and it is hard to bring it. So, I usually borrow them. But, It is noe enough all of student use them. I want to increase them and reduce price that borrow them. If my wish change true, we can use bike and quickboard everywhere at everytime we want."	3	2.5	2.5	8
1751	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change one thing, I will change the method of listening lecture in my university. I think lots of classes are focused on only delivering knowledges. our most of classes are composed of only listening lectures.It has a lot of great adventures. For example, We can know a lot of knowledge and absorb the teacher's ideas. But i think that it will be dangerous to students in these days. There are three reasons in my opinion. 
First of all, Only listening lectures let stop thinking on their way.  I believe that we have to discuss and share ideas in class time. I want to say that making own ideas and thinking is more important than good scores in tests. So it is very important to express their ideas and share thinking in lectures.
Second, the method of only listening lecture is dangerous to fix their mindset.  It makes to focus on only taking tests in their lecture. Students have to develop own their thinking and mind. Flexible mindset can change the world better. However fixed knowledge can't change anything. In these reasons, We have to develop to express ideas with people. Only few listening lecture is necessary to students. But, the most of lectures have to change the method and processes. 
Third, the only listening class of lecture is old process in old university. Nowadays, there are new knowledge and ideas. In these days, Making new knowledge is very necessary point. So we need to find the new insight while sharing ideas with professors and students. 
Finally, Although I definitely agree to absorb the knowledge while listening lecture. But it is too dangerous to focus listening. In these reasons, I want to change the process of listening in class time. "	3.5	4	2.5	10

 First, upgrade the class application server. After I enter the university, I experience that the server always go down and university fixed it in 1 hour. But we don't know when the server was fixed, so we wait endlessly until it. I think it is not a first come. It is just who can wait long. So, I think it's better to upgrade the server than always fix it.
 Second is about choosing students by draw. I think we go to university to learn. Then, each student will have a class what they want. If that class is popular, having that class is more difficult. If we catch the class by first come, not drawing, Then it is our lack of ability, but now it is beyond our ability. So, if we can't win in drawing, we almost lost our semester with a class we don't want. i want to change "	2	2	3.5	7.5
1753	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Is the Korean education really the best?

        Education is one of the things that Koreans are proud of. It’s not surprising to hear that someone from South Korea won the gold medal from an international competition. And we’ve taught that South Korea is one of the smartest countries on earth. But in reality, South Korea is not the best country when it comes to education, if you really think about what education is eventually for. For example, there is no Nobel laureate who won the Nobel prize for their academic achievement. This may imply that the education system of South Korea is not the best to grow researchers.
        First of all, the Korean education system focuses too much on problem solving. Rather than trying to understand fundamental concepts, Korean students spend most of their time solving problems. But this is not the best way for them to learn something. It might help them get good grades for exams in the future, but what they really have to do as a researcher is something creative. There would be nothing they can do if they were to asked to do something creative as a researcher. 
        In addition, a lot of students lose interest in studying after graduation from high school. A lot of people think that colleges are not a place to study but to enjoy their 20’s life. And since the students at colleges had studied very hard until they graduated from high school, the chances are that they face burnout right after they enter a college. There is no exam like Korean-SAT at college, for which they studied for the past 3 years in high school, so they’re very likely to lose their motivations to study at college. The majority students study very hard in high school to get into a good uni, but that’s not really what education is for.
        Moreover, all the students who get the best grades in high school end up becoming a doctor or a public officer who works for the government. This might help improve the medical system or the govenment of South Korea, but it’s too unbalanced in this country. In other countries, straight-A students in high school are very encouraged to do something they really want to do. But in South Korea, every straight-A student ends up going to a med school or becoming a public officer no matter what they are interested in. If those talented students did something in which they were really interested, South Korea would have become a lot more competitive country.
        To sum up, the education system is South Korea is not very efficient for students to become a researcher. This system is too much focused on problem solving, so they can’t really do something creative in the future. Also, a lot of students stop studying hard after graduating from high school, becuase going to a good uni was their only reason for studying. Moreover, all the talented students in South Korea end up going to a med school or becoming a public officer. If they chose to do what they were interested in, South Korea would have become a lot more developed country. Education is the most important for the future of this country, and it’s our duty to make it better."	5	5	4.5	14.5
1754	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Some people think that Korea has good and systematic education system. However, the education system in Korea is needed to change.

  First, the system is too focused on study. Students may have other specialties besides studying. However, because of the study-focused system, It is difficult for them to have opportunities to utilize the specialties. Also, students' stress increases. This is because there is a tendency to evaluate students' worth only by studying.


  Second, the system makes students feel the gap between rich and poor. It is hard to get good grades only throught public education provided by schools. Therefore, parents send their children to academy, and the quality of private education varies according to the degree of wealth. When a family is wealthy, the child go to a good academy, get a good education, and eventually get good grades in school. 

  In conclusion, the education system in Korea is needed to change. It is too study-focused and makes students feel the gap between rich and poor."	3	3	2.5	8.5

"In the news, I was able to see some articles about crimes like driving while drunken. Even the crimes would harm not only him/herself  but also the other person, the punishment looks too small. Also there was another types of crime that has too small punishment. They didn't looking make people commit in the crime. If I could change one important thing about my country, I would change the stiffness of the punishment for some crimes.
 First, driving while drunken should be a bigger crime. The dangers from driving while drunken comes in unexpectable behavier. When the driver is drunken, he or she doesn't know how to control his or her car. For example, when he or she needs to accelerate, they would make their car stop. These unexpectable behavier make other drivers to be confused. Soon, the danger of accidents are increased. It is not the only reason for making driving while drunken to be a bigger crime. Because the behavier may kill not only him of her self but also the other person ramdomly. These looks enough to be the supporting reasons for making it as a bigger crime.
 Second, the lie that telling someone else to have done a crime should be a bigger crime. This is very bad crime in killing someone's life without any reason. We know that it is harder to make an evidence, ""I didn't do that!"". So, in Korea, to track someone as a crimer, the police officer must think that he or she is not a crimer. But, for some cases of crimes, this doesn't keeped by police officers. That means, even I didn't do anything, I would be treated as someone who cummit a serius crime. More, this would make he or her life to be extremely bad. They will be fired, and lost their friends and credits. Even the crime may kill other's life very easyly, the punishment of it is too small.
 In conclusion, the punishment of some crimes must be enhanced. Driving while drunken and the lie that telling someone else to have done a crime are also in the crimes. There can be other crimes that have not enough punishment. Not enough punishment is similar with making people to be a crimer. To make Korea better country, we have to make the punishment for crimes to be fited in their crimes. The world is changing too fast, the laws must follow the speed."	4	3.5	3	10.5

  Do you have '롱패딩'? Many Korean have this, so in the winter, we can see some black long sticks walk around. '롱패딩' is popular because winter in Korea is very very cold. As you know, Korea has 4 seasons. I love that too. But summer is too hot and winter is too cold. And the global warming makes hotter and hotter, and colder and colder.

Everything, or everyone cannot be perfect. But people know that just one important change might significantly improve them. What about the country? Even South Korea(ROK) has amount of provblems, one important change can make South Korea better country. This paper is going to argue about South Korea will be better if it unites with North Korea, as known as DPRK.
First of all, there are so many problems in ROK which are caused by DPRK. Today in ROK, males' military service is very big issue. Every korean males should join military service if they don't have serious disease of disability. This is because ROK and DPRK is rest-in-war of Korean War. Uniting two countries might smallen their military, and it will stop military service. This means males can get their job earlier, and it might solve low birth problem of ROK. Also, there are some political issues which are caused by division of Korean Peninsula. Parties of Korea have fought over 60 years with the issue about DPRK. The issue was 'are some parties work just for DPRK?' Of course the stage to get united Korea might be difficult, the end session will definitely finish those problems, or issues.
Secondly, economic problem can be solved. As well known, ROK has high technology and industry, and DPRK has workers with low prices. During the time of uniting, companies of ROK can make products with cheaper cost than before. Furthermore, these companies will improve economy of North, and it means DPRK can be a market of ROK's companies. Also, the unstableness of economy which is caused by division can be solved. Since Korean Peninsula is on war, foreign companies are afraid to put money, or invest ROK. Uniting will end the threat of war, then foreign money can improve Korean economy faster than before.
Lastly, big country can make bigger voice in global issues. This 'big' does not means big land(area), but it means numbers of citizen and power of economy. Look at recent global issues. Countries which have power or large voice are mostly big countries, such as US, China, etc. Even Korea is one of big country, it was hard to make voice, or give an idea of issue. Issues about human rights problems of China, or Taiwan issue might be good examples. United Korea will have more population and economical power by upper reasons, so can make own voice in global society.
In conclusion, there are many problems of distinct subjects in Korea such as military, politics, economy, etc. Uniting of ROK and DPRK can solve those problems on time. Furthermore, solving those problems makes enough powerful to make its own voice in global issues. Therefore, one important change-uniting of Korean Peninsula- will definitely improve South Korea to be a better country."	5	4.5	3.5	13
1758	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    In Korea, high school students are living in a very hard life since they have to go to great university like KAIST. In week days, they study in school from 9 AM to 10 PM, and in weekends, they study in academy. Also, almost every student in Korea goes to university. Because there are so many universities. So, this essay argues that Korean government have to reduce the number of universities and give students freedom for two reasons.
    First, going to a good university is not the only way to become a successful person. That is, there are many ways to success without going to university. For example, being great for some sports, becoming a great artist, or even making many people laugh at an internet broadcasting. These people can make a lot of money and we can say that is success of life. Therefore, it will be important for each student to find a way to success that he or she can do the best.
    Second, too many universites make people think everyone must go to a university. Not everyone should go to university, but almost every Korean students go to university. Even, some university can not fullfill their TO. This phenomenon can restrict Korean students' potential abblities. Because going to university is not the only way to success as discussed in previous paragraph. If there were less universities, Korea might have more famous sports stars or artists. Therefore, the government should reduce some universities so that people can break break their stereotypes that every students must study for university.
    In conclusion, this essay argued that Korean government should decrease the number of universities, so  give students freedom to choice ways of their lives. The first reason was going to great university is not the only way to success. There are many ways to success. And the second reason was too many universites make a stereotype that everyone must go to a university. In addition, only reducing some universities will have bad effect for students. So, there will be needed supplies for students to find their potential abblities about wide spectrums of work."	4.5	4	3.5	12

The combination of mountains, rivers, and buildings is very lovely, but the metro system is too worse to travel or visit details of  Deajeon. If I could change one thing about Daejeon, I would change metro system. Now, I will explain reasons about why I want to change metro system.
       First, Daejeon’s metro line is just one. It can’t be best public transport because bus can transport people to details of city, but metro can’t. But if people don’t use subway, the government of subway-department will not make more metro line, and people don’t use subway again, and again, this is bad circulation.  Therefore just adding one subway line can break this circulation and people more often use subway. 
       Second, subway system use electrocity so system do not make environment problem. In contrast, car, bus, airplane use fossil fuel and it accelerates global warming. Nowadays, people have to reduce CO2 emission, in this point the subway system can be appropriate one. And subway makes people to walk. When people get off subway, they have to move up to there destination through stairs. If people goes there company with subway, people step up stairs everyday and it make them healthy. 
       Finally, total cost(electricity fee, average fix cost, etc) is just 200,000 won per one operation. It just use electricity so cost is not to much expensive.And it can make economical effect for country government’s budget. People pay almost 1,000 won for using subway so just 200 people use the subway during train moves end to end then it is mathmatically zero-cost for the department, and after 200 people, they can earn money. It means they use this money to welfare for Daejeon. 
       In conclusion, I want to change Daejeon’s subway system. Daejeon has now just one line of subway, and it makes bad circulaion. And subway is relatively eco-friendly public transport because of using electrocity. Lastly, total cost per one operation is not much expensive and it can get economical effects. So next time, use subway to move anywhere in Daejeon, not bus. "	4.5	3.5	3.5	11.5
1760	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  Today, almost everyone can access to the internet. We can see what other countries doing or how they live whenever we want. There are also a lot of reports or essays about them. These are, of course, good phenomena but they also brought the seed of conflict. As we now know how other countries live, people started to compare our own culture with others. Discussions have been made to rethink about our culture. Someone says we need to change, while others say that is our tradition. Because I am in the younger side, it is likely to support the changer's opinion. Among the things that we felt it needs to change, if I could change one thing, I want to change the strict atmosphere about age. We are going to see why with 3 reasons in this essay.

  First, overly-strict atmosphere about age abandons discussions. There are lots of situations that people need to talk and think a lot with all members of certain groups. But some old people or even some young people treat younger people as their opinions are nothing because they are young. They say this is our tradition. But no. Age doesn't determine the value of arguments. I could understand why those traditions were made, because like 5000 years ago the elder was those who had all knowledge. But it's 21st century. Everyone can access to all kinds of data. We need to change now.

  Second, those who aged without getting wise use this atmosphere to support their reckless opinions. There are so many people nowadays so some people might not have ability to think in a logical way. They should listen to other's opinions and practice to make opinions that make sense. But, this culture makes them to not to practice. It makes them to spit out their poor thoughts, and makes them think they are right because the listeners don't argue due to the age difference. This is one of the most terrible thing made by the culture.

  Lastly, this tradition makes people to obey to the older ones. Due to the culture, we have very strict 선배-후배 relation. I don't even know what we should call '선배-후배' in English. Of course if someone's performance is superior, we would look up to him/her by our wills. But, in Korea, the elders, even they are just one year older, forces to look up to them. This is total non-sense. We need to break this culture as fast as we can.

  To sum up, if I could change one thing about my country, I would like to change the strict atmosphere about age. This atmosphere refuses any discussions between young and old. Second, those who are old use this culture to support their opinions. Lastly, this tradition makes people to look up to the older ones without logical reasons. Now, we're in 21st c"	4.5	4	3.5	12

•	

Many people think that Korea is good country to live. Korea has strict police system, clean roads,  and so many other positive things to contribute. But there are some things we have to change. In this article, I stronly argue that we should change the education system of Korea. Then, I will tell you why I want to change the education system of Korea.


First, our education system makes students tired. Korea is famous for its strict education system. Some may say that it is the most developed and systemical education in the world. But, it is not true. By the research held by Seoul National University, the learning efficiency of Korea student is very lower than other G20 countries like United states, Japan, and europe. In other words, we have forced students to study a lot rather than teaching them by good system. It makes students tired and exhausted from the learning. So I want to adjust the education system which can decrease the stress of students.


Second, it makes the learning gap between rich students and poor students. Korea has a special learning system called 'hak-won' also known as 'after-school academy' in English. It is not a national learning system. So, students must pay to learn in that place and this is the problem. Rich students can pay more than others, so they goes to Gangnam academy which hires star teachers. In the contrast, some poor students can only goes to small academy. It makes the learning gap between two students. Of course, there are some counterexample of this gap like poor students gets 1st grade on the admission test. But, in general, it is true that there is a gap between two students. Also, technology is advancing very fast nowadays, so the learning gap will be much bigger in the future. 


Finally, it teaches so many things which are not necessary in the future. For example of other countries, Japanese education system teaches common things before the highschool. But, In Korea, we teaches a lot of things until the graduation of high school. Do you think all the things we learn for 12 years are necessary? As the pole held to the high school students, they do not think that what they learn in highschool is necessary. Also, in my case, I don't think that Japanse and Psycology is necessary for my life. So I want to change our education system to let students select the subject which is necessary for their future. 


To sum up, I talked about the thing what I want to change in Korea, education system, and the reasons. Korean education system makes students so tired, makes the laarning gap between the students, teaches so many not necessary things. If Korean government wants to make Korea as advanced education country, they should manipulate the education system like Denmark, United states. I hope our children learn efficiently and happly  in the future."	5	4	4	13
1762	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If you can change one thing about your counrty, what would you change? Someone who tell about policy, or welfare. There are so many things to change in our country. For example, discrimination between man and weman is serious problem, or decreasing child birth rate is also big problem. But education is foundation of every things. There are two big reasons why teaching method for children should change.
First, children is directly connecting with future. In order for the state to gain strength, improving skills and techniques is most important. To improve  skills and techniques, we have to teach children more innovative way.  For example, if our country's goal is become best at farming, we have to teach children how to farm. Next, poor education method makes children less creative. Poor education makes children less competitive. When they become a adult, they are worried about earning money. Therefore they don't challenge anythings.
Second, what children learned when they were in teenage is determined their jobs. Innovative education makes children have various way. What you learned is determined the way that you watch the world. For example,  if child learns about music, he or she may have more likelihood to become a musican. Next, learning is starting point for everything. Innovative education allow that we can save our time. If you save your time, you can exprience more things compared to other person.
In conclusion, education method should be changed. First, children is our future. what we teach to children now is determined our future after 10 years, or more. Second, education is directly linked with children's future. Therefore, we have to create more opportuniteis for our children. To become a rich and power country, we have to take care about education."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1763	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Smoke Decreasing = Health Increasing
    Don't you have a lot of experiences that you did not want to smell  smoke of cigarattes, but did it because of surrounding people? In Korea, lots of people smoke, and also, many people suffering from diaeases cause by smoking. So, if I could change one important thing about my country, I would like to limit number of cigarattes that can buy in one week for these two reasons.
    First, cigarattes are really harmful for smokers and their surrounders. It means not only smokers get damaged to their health, but also their surrounders who smell that smoke. For example, a young children can get lung cancer by indirect smoking from their parents. They did not smoke directly, but smoke of parents' cigarattes went into their nose and lungs. In addition, smokers are in a danger with many kinds of cancer. There are plenty of substances in cigarattes that can cause cancer. Since cancer is a extremely dangerous disease,  we have to decrease probability of it by limiting number of cigarattes that can buy in one week. 
    Second, cigarattes used in one day in Korea will be decreased. Since they can not buy a lot of cigarattes in a week, people will less smoke that before.  For instance, let's assume that I smoked 20 cigarattes in a week. Also, assume that limit number of cigarattes that can buy in a week is 10. Then number of smoking of me decreases 20 to 10. At the first time, I will be really confused about it, but with my parents, friends, and government's help, I  could easily achieve the goal. 
    In conclusion, I talked about two reasons why I would like to limit number of cigarattes that can buy in one week. Cigarattes are dangerous not only for smokers, but also surrounders because of indirect smoking. Both direct smoking and indirect smoking can cause many kinds of cancer. Furthermore, people will less smoke by this idea. Less smoking in a country is good for everyone lives in the country. If you are a smoker, your daughter or son can get cancer faster than you, so think about it seriously. "	4.5	4.5	4	13
1764	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Have you ever seen comments under political articles, or twitters about gender issues? I was very surprised when I saw the comments under an article, because there are many discrimination expressions not related to the article and excessive hatred in comments. Nowaday, there is lots of hatred in Korea in several aspects, such as gender conflict and political conflict, and I want to remove this negative feelings widespread in whole society. There are three reasons why I want to deal with hatred problems.
First of all, hatred kills diversity in our society. Fisrt, It makes more discriminations. There are many discriminations toward homosexuality and specific religions such as Catholic. People who love people having the same sex and People who believe Jesus don't harm people and affect negative effects on society. However, as hatred first starts among crowds, hatred gets bigger and bigger among society. Then, discriminiation gets harder. Also, it dismiss voices of group with small number of people. Hatred is very powerful and aggressive emotion, so it lessens rational thinking of crowds. When crowds are full of hatred, they easily critisize others without rational reason and people who are not in crowds can't say their words loudly. It criticaly lessens our society's diversity.
Next, hatred is not good for mental health and emotions of teenagers, especially. Teenagers are easy to access hatred through SNS and comments of articles. They're very sensitive to negative criticism. So It would lead them to depression and mental disorder. Nowadays, teenagers' incidence fo self suicide goes high, and it's main reason is hatred widespread in society. We should deal with it. And, if teens grow in society full of aggressive emotions, they easily grow violent and aggressive adults. It would cause high incidence of crimes. 
To sum up, I want to remove hatred in our country. There are many negative emotions among our society. People use discrimination expressions on the Internet freely, but it is not good for our society. It lessens our society's diversity and disturb teenager's healthy mental grow. If campaign against hatred held, h"	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5
1765	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"These days, almost all of the student, who are the last age of high school, must take a big exam to go to unversity. Some students just need to get over grade than the grade that university said to, but  for some other student, this exam is totally their life. From this, there are some students who didn't get satisfied grade, and take exam again and again. This can be a great stress for many students. Indeed, some students get a lot of stress and try to end their life by their hands. So, if I can change one thing from Korea, I want to downgrade the important of this exam, or loosen the ratio of course that choosing student just by this exam in university.
 For first reason, it can loosen stress of the students from one cause, and it can leads to two good effects. If the importance of this exam is downgraded, students can study in less forced environment. Now, teachers and parents around the students force their student strongly to study to get a good grade on this exam, but if it is not that important, they don't need to force their students. It can lead to improvement of efficiency of study. One of the things that make student hard to study is a stress. Students always have a stress of exam, and it always makes student hard to study. But, without stress, students can study what they want to, and it can improve the efficiency of study. Next, students can live at least happier life. Because of the huge stress from the exam, some students have a bad mind of their life and this world, and can suddenly lose the control and do some bad things. But, if we can make a less-stressful environment, some of this can be reduced.
 Next, downgrading the importance of exam can distribute chance equally to students from one cause, and it has some effects on student. From downgrading the importance of exam, university can not just see the score of the exam, but can see the students theirselves. University can see all students talent, and then can choose from the students. It can result in equal chance of going to university. Equal chance of going to university can lead students to do what they want to do. Students can make their effort to find their talent, not just studying hard. It can trully lead a talent from the students.
 In conclusion, I want to change Korea's final exam of going to university, by downgrading it's importance and loosening the ratio of course at university. This has two advantages: loosen students' stress, and distribute chance equally to students. Students can study more efficiently what they want to do, and can make at least happier life than these days. From now, we should look straightly of this problem and try to find what we can change right now to solve this."	5	4.5	4.5	14
1766	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"There are many problems in S.Korea. The rich get richer, The poor get poorer.  And, not only the market system, there are many minor problem include military system.  If  I could change one important thing about S.Korea, I want to change the military service system.
First, girls also should go to military service. S.Korea's male should go to military service at when they are 20 years-old for about 2 years. They spend their important times of 20s in the military. Through girls' military service, we can reduce this period.  Also, more  than 90% of S.Korea's male should go to military service. It means you can walk and you are a male of S.Korea, you should go to military service  nevertheless you have a minor lack. This percentage is more than the Nazzi, Germany. If girls go to military service there can be more soldier and we can protect some males who are not fit in the military service and could get higher quality of  army  by reducing the percentage of males' military sercvice.
Second, S.Korea government should give more sevice to the soldier.  In the law, employeer should give more than 8720 won per a hour. According to this law, the soldier of S.Korea should get at least 2 milions won per a month. However,  the government gives them less than 500 thousands won per a month. Also,  the government should improve the quality of the food.  The price of the meal to the soldier is less than 5000 won per a meal. Nevertheless they go to military sevice to protect the country, why they should eat low-quality food?
In conclusion I want change the military service system of  the S.Korea. I want to change two things, girls' military service and the service to the soldier. Those two things should be done because we should improve the quality of the military. The problem of military is not just the problem of 20 years-old boys. The boys could be boyfriends, brothers and the problem also could be lead to protecting ability of S.Korea. So, I argued we should focus on the military's problem more and more."	4.5	4	3.5	12
1767	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Each country has its own good things and bad things because of their location, history, biome, economy, atmosphere etc. These factors sometimes make strong country, such as United States of America. Our country, Korea also has a lot of advantages because of surroundings. Four specialized weather can be an example of it.  However, I want to change our countries' location for the following reasons.
            First, our country has too much mountain. The basic of industry is farming. Without farming, people can eat food. For farming, we need a large plane. However, our country don't have a lot of plane. This is because of mountain. I'm not saying mountain is bad, but our country has too many mountains. If Korea had fewer mountain than now, economy and life quality will be better than now.
            Second, this land is to small. Do you know that one state of United States of America is much larger than whole Korea? When I was young, I was surprised because of it. Actually, Korea's population density is one of the largest in the world countries. To accept people in small place, Korea started to build apartment. When a lot of apartment is conformed, Koreans stereotype changed from living in own house is normal to living in apartment is normal. Because of this, cost of apartment is getting higher and higher everyday. In Korea, a lot of people can't live in their own house nowadays. If our land is Canada, or China, this problem will be not happened.
            Third, easy to be invaded in history. In Korean history, a lot of other countries invaded Korea. China, Japan, Russia, France is example. This is because of location. Our country is surrounded with a lot of countries. This mean other countries can easily invade our country. I thought it was just related with a long time ago, but it is not true. North side, there is China, and China reflicts to USA. World thought Korea is the best place to prevent China. They had come to Korea, and found person to spread democracy. China had same thought, so each side choosed one person. Fight of this two ideologies finally made Korean war in 1950. War destroied a lot of things. If we were not located in this land, people didn't have to be suffered from war.
            In conclusion, our country's biome is bad, size is small, and have always-invaded-history. Our country, Korea would be stronger than now when we are located in better place. However, we know it is just a imagination. The thing that should we do is do our best to improve our country in this given condition.  Why don't you think about solution to solve these disadvantages? Giving better country to next generation so that they don't think Korea is not a good country is our assignment. "	3.5	4	3	10.5
1768	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Korea have been developing since 1960s quickly. Korean made new industry successful and Korean product could get good score in global market. Although, however, Korea is the only country that become leading country from low level country in modern age, Korean has no valueable resource in their land. Korean had to develop with only power of people. Therefore, in today, Korean has some too much passion for studying or successful. In my opinion, Korean should reduce over competition in their social life for 2 reasons, which I will introduce following.

 First, over competition of people remove the truth among Korean, which could make separation of people. Truth among people is important for social. However, competition recommend to win friend or partner, which lead to no truth among friend and partner. Surprisingly, already Korea is changed to no truth social. For example, in IMF, a lot of Korean give their own gold bar to government for econonmy. On the other hand, no one give their own property for poor or government. 

Second, over competition decrease the level of life, which make a lot of stress. Stress could cause a lot of disease. Although Korean medical system is amazing, a lot of patients are suffered by mind disease. Also, In korea, there are a lot of people who suicide due to stress. According to research, Korea's rank of suicinding rate in youth is 1st in OECD. Seriously, Korea has more problems which are caused by over stress in country. We have to reduce this stress by forbid competition.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that Korean should reduce competition in their life. This is because over competion separate citizen, and cause a lot of stress. Separation of people lead to collapse of social structure, and over stress could a lot of disease and suicide. No more competition for sucess, just enjoy your life now."	4	4	4	12
1769	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  If I could change one important thing about my country, I'd like to change the education system. In South Korea, most of students take the biggest exam, Korea's SAT, to go to the university. But this system has a big problem that students prefer medical university too much. When someone got perfect score on that exam, that guy would go to the medical department of Seoul National University. I'm going to argue that the preference of the medical university should be changed because of the following reasons.
  First, natural science and techniques improve so slowly. Smart students are needed to natural science and techniques, but they are moving to the medical universities. That means we are losing people to make the country be strong. Natural science is the biggest root of the whole science and engineering, so it sould be improved with smart students. For example, when I try to develop electronic devices, physics and chemistry are needed. Every natural sciences are needed when the country develop some techniques.
  Second, students get too much stress when they struggle to get high score on the test. Educating students naturally is important, I think. Every students has own goals or hobbies. We should respect individual's goals and hobbies, but Korea is more like to make students take that big exam only. 
  In conclusion, I want to change the aim of the education. Currently that aim is more likely to the medical university, so I want to change this to the balanced state between natural science and the medical university. Medical is also very important industry, but I think this is too tilted."	3.5	4	4	11.5
1770	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" There are many advantages to live in Korea. For example, there are good health insurance, broad and fast internet, simple and easy transport and so on. But, there are not only advantages in Korea. The country was grown up rapidly for a short while, so it has many problems, too. The most thing I want to change in this country is the education system. Korea's education system always emphasizes the grades. Especially, for the minors, that's not a good system. I think the grades are not the important criteria to judge the students. Adults should make other ways to judge them.
 The first reason that I want to change education system is the grades and scores just make students' psychological pressure. The educational system that encourages competition doesn't create a desire for students to study. It makes them tired and worried. In order to grow students' thoughts, it is not to put pressure on them, but to help them find what they want to do. There are many other things to do except studying. While they are minors, adults should give chances them to experience various things and help them find their ability.
 Second reason is the scores and grades is not same as the students' ability. When people go out to society, usually the leadership, insights and communication are more important than studying. The grades cannot judge the students' ability in society. They should learn how to live together, but the grades and scores make people to learn how to win.
 Lastly, not only study, but also activities are important for minors. Like other countries, they usually emphasize club activities. There are various clubs such as musical club, baseball club, cheerleading, and so on. But in Korea, realatively few types and activities in club. And Korea's education system doesn't emphasize the club activities and deals with additional activities. But, Korea should make more types of clubs and emphasize them. There are enough worth to do it. Because, not all the students should study and to be a doctor or engineer.
 For these reasons, I want to change the education system of Korea. Make more club activities and emphasize them, or change the judgement not the grades to judge students. I wish students to experience many things."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1771	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     Myth of Korea told that Dangeun picked a location of our country, but it was not a good choice. After he chose that region, Korean have suffered because of various reasons historically. Therefore, if  I can chane one thing in my  country, I want to change location of Korea.
     First, there are many mountains in Korea. It is good to have mountain, but if many mountains make lines in a very big scale, that comes to disadvantage. In East of Korea, lines which are consist of mountains are exist. In there, we can see mountain in every direction. That is not good becuase we can't use that ground.  We can't make city, factories, farm on mountain. It became useless ground.
     Second, summer is hot and winter is cold. Korea have 4 seasons, and it was a proud of our country. However, with global warming, polarization was started. Summer becomes more hotter, and winter becomes more colder. Korean should prepare both coldness and hotness. Also,  term of summer and winter becomes shorter, so temperature changes for fast velocity. It makes our immune syatem weaker, and make us easier to get cold.
     Third, Korea have high risk of war because of location. There are China, Japan, North Korea nearby. North Korea is very dangerous country which doesn't obey international rule. China and Japan are very strong country in international society. China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea are not in a good relationship, so we should worried about war.

After Korea War at 1950, Korea becomes enemy to DPRK which had been one country.
While we stay far from them, we are losing many things socially and personally .
If I could change one thing about my country, I should change situation with DPRK.
 First, we are losing many things socially.
there are three way to trade;ground, ocean, and sky.
Though we are not island, we can't use rail on ground. 
So, we don't have economic gain by rail trade.
Also foreigner think Korea can be in war whenever.
It interrupt foreigner traveling and investing to Korea because of danger.
 However we are losing not only socially but also personally.
Every man in Korea have to be soldier for 2 years when they are 20.
It cause Korean man to lose their patriotship and ability using brain.

1773	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I would change the scholarship system of this university.

I do think allowing students to study at KAIST for free could increase the gap between the rich and the poor. A lot of students could get into KAIST because  their parents had invested a lot of money for their children's education, meaning that the parents tend to be richer than other parents. With the degree of KAIST, the students will also be likely to become rich parents in the future, and their children will also end up getting into universities like KAIST.

For the same reason, those who couldn't get into KAIST since their parents couldn't afford to provide their kids with high quality education are less likely to be richer than those who graduated from KAIST. It means they also can't invest enough money in their children's education. Ironically, universities with a low ranking relatively tend to have more expensive tuition, meaning it's hard for the students to get a better job in the future, which will eventually cause the same problem in the next generation.  

This scholarship system stemmed from the assumption that the students studying at KAIST will give more profits to this country eventually. This could be true, at least in the past. But nowadays the mindset of the majority of students studying at KAIST isn't like that. Most of them prioritize their private interest over the profit of this country, so I think there is really no reason for KAIST to provide them with free scholarship. Also, this university can invest the money in R&D instead of scholarship, which could also help KAIST get more profit. 

This can be one of the best ways to impose ""taxing the rich"" policy without making controversies in this country. The original version of ""taxing the rich"" has mad tons of controversies, because it's shifting the responsibility onto the rich, discouraging people to try to success in this country. However, imposing tuition wouldn't cause such problem, as it's more logical and natural. Higher level education should be more expensive. It's just the same as why more delicious food is more expensive.


For these reasons, I think KAIST should change the scholarship system."	4.5	5	4	13.5

On top of that, there are noise problems. The rooms are too close each other, so noises come through the wall and door. Yesterday, i could not sleep almost for an hour because of the noise that the students passing my room made.

In this regard, if i could change one thing in Kaist, i would renew the old dormitories like 아름관."	1.5	1.5	2	5
1775	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change one important thing about my university, I would change the endless streat. The endless streat is a streat where we use to go outside. Even we use the streat a lot by riding a bicycle, there is no road for riding bicycles. Also, the endless streat is quite long, so I suggest to make a moving walks on the streat.


 Why do we need a road for riding bicycles? In my university, you will be able to see a lot of bicycles which is being parked. I think this means that the student in my university will use bicycle for going somewhere. I feel some danger of acident while riding a bicycle in my university. With bicycle, I would able to go 2 types of road. One has the risk of to strike with human, and the other one has  the risk of to be stroked with a car. By making a road for riding bicycle, we will able to decrease the risks of the acidents. Also, it will look better than before.

 I also suggest to make a moving walks on the streat. There is not a big reason which means we have to make it. But I think this will make our lives in our university better. With moving walks, we will able to pass the endless streat fast and convienient. Because my university is one of the universities that walking first for tec., I wish that to make a moving walks on there.

 I thought the endless streat needs some changes. To decrease the risk of car acidents, I think we need a road for bicycles in the endless streat. I know my university is working hard for safety, but I think this is a important part which we should solve faster.
Thank you."	3	3	3	9
1776	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" A few months ago, the program 'You Quiz' interviewed dean of my university, KAIST. He was very unique and impressing person. Also, the most important thing that I recognized is he always has a passion and vision for KAIST, and try to develop our university. Constrastly, I'm just a freshman after all with much less passion and vision for KAIST. So, I don't want to change vision or lecture of dean and professor. FIrst, I don't know that much, and I agree with their opinion. Finally I would change one important but not important, the location.
Sadly, some of my high school student prefer Seoul University to KAIST. One of the bigest reason was KAIST is in 대전. This fact have profit, of course. Students can concentrate studying. Labs can concentrate research more. Wide campus. Fresh air. Ducks. Reduce moving all infra to Seoul too much. But I want to move KAIST near to Seoul. I can say this opinion because I know it is impossible. I'll tell you the benefits that KAIST will get if it moves to near to Seoul. The only reason is there are too much people, infra, conference. Moving KAIST will make KAIST access easily to Seoul. 1/5 of Korean live in Seoul. KAIST have amount of students in Seoul. And also many conference and university in Seoul. But we have to use train, bus, or car. All of these take more than 3 hours. And we have to spend for oil and ticket. KTX is 50,000won once. We can save time and money of students and professor. Also we can expect that KAIST may contact to other university easier.
Some of you can worry about students don't study and just play. But, I said I'll do not move to Seoul, but near to Seoul. Let's just reduce the distance between Seoul and KAIST. Seoul will be not so far, also not so near. Students have to spend time and money to go to Seoul still.
So, I would move KAIST to somewhere near to Seoul. Because of amount of infra and university in Seoul, It will save our money and time. "	2.5	2	3	7.5
1777	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"During your life time, you might have some chance to change system or something else of your surrounding. It can be at your work, family, etc. Making some idea about it will be a nice work for your inhance.
Since I am spending amount of time in this university, KAIST, I will write about one important-changing-thing about this university. If I have chance to do, I would change the location of university. Some people might say that current location, Daejeon is proper. But my idea is about the specific one.

I think current location, 어은동, is too far from the main area of the city. For dinner or shopping outside, we have no choice but calling taxi to move to main area. It costs too much money for university students who cannot earn enough money for those things. if KAIST is nearby the center, students could walk around for those things.
Few disagreement may be caused by the reason of current location. Few decades ago, KAIST positioned here to make Daejeon as the center of science and technology. Following that idea, lots of Labs from government and companies locate near KAIST. It means if we just move only KAIST, communicating with those labs might be hard with the vision of pasts. However, advancement of communication technology could break those worry, so the problem might be nothing.
There is one more thing that my friend and I usually talk about. Every system and professors, even environments of KAIST is better than any other university in Korea except only one problem. As you can know, this is the problem about location, which is not in Seoul. Huge amount of infra are concentrated in Seoul, so it is prefered to go university in Seoul. But some problems related to money and laws stop to make new, or move university to Seoul. So moving KAIST near center of Daejeon such as near the train station can be the alternative answer.

Since problem of capital-concentration of Korea, not all problem of location can be solved with my idea. But with reasons above, I think moving near main area can be alternative answer to clear some issues. "	4	3	4	11
1778	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" If I could change one important thing about my university, I would like to change the way to login the KAIST website. When I just entered KAIST spring semester, I didn't have to login using a smartphone.  Only using account ID and password, we could connect the whole KAIST website.
 But, starting the summer semester, the way to login website has been changed. The new way to login website was this:
1. Type your KAIST ID.
2. Connect your KAIST ID and your smartphone using KAIST Auth application.
3. Everytime you try to login, you must certify twice using your smartphone KAIST Auth app in biological way(finger print or eye information) or OTP(one-time password)
 I always feel uncomfortable when I login KAIST website due to this way to login. This is because I have to turn on my smartphone everytime I login. When I study something I usually turn off my smartphone because that makes me not focused. Also, I have to use KLMS website to study. If I make a mistake to log off KLMS website by turning off the browser or something, I should turn on my smartphone to login again. I think it is such a useless way.
 Also, there is another problem. If I lost my smartphone or didn't bring it from somewhere, I cannot login to the KAIST website. Because to login always needs a smartphone. It is very important problem to university student, because without KLMS we cannot attend online-classes and that must affect badly to the grade. This situation haven't happened to me yet, but it is enough to occur.
 But that login way also has benefits. It is safe due to biological data or OTP. So that prevents someone else login to my account. And it does not need account password because biological data and OTP are used like a password.
 However, that way has these benefits but I think it is too uncomfortable everytime I login. I wish it changes back to old ways which only need a password of the account and don't need any smartphone application."	4.5	4	4.5	13
1779	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" In my university, KASIT, all freshmen have to live in dormitory. There are some dorm policies, but some of them are unacceptable to me and my friends. All my university friends are live in diffenent dormitory bildings. But by the dorm rules, we can’t go and play with friends. If we go to others room, we get 50 punish points. If that point goes 100, we get permanant expell. 
 I think korean student works hard when they are high school student, so there is no time to high-leveled socialization. University offers student the knowledge about there major, and also in university, student can be socialized by hanging up with friends, or some other people. But in KAIST dorm rule, we cannot do this. 
 I think  the reason why this rule made is unaccepted people can enter the dormitory and make bad situation and I understand it.  But our dorm’s security is already high-level. We have to tag our student ID card twice, and press password each room. what a secure. I think this socialization-interupting rule should be delete. 
 Actually in Yeonsei-university and Kyeongsang National University(KNU) all of students can enter and meet there friends in there room. Almost Korean university student thinks the KAIST student is un-socialized (like a nerd). So I will change this insane rule and make KAISTian happy. 
 KAIST says  most inportant thing in start-up  is currency and they will increase welfare about start-up. But I think most inportant thing in start-up is meet lots of people and get ther opinion and know about demand of people. By deleting this weird rule, more students try to start-up and get more sucess I think. "	3	2.5	3	8.5
1780	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  At the beginning of the semester, all students try to attend to specific classes that they want to study. So, they prepare like 10 minutes before the course application starts cause it is a competition of faster speed. However, whenever the application begins, KAIST server blows up for at least an hour. This is why I would change the server computer If I could change one important thing about my university.

 First, if we extend our server computer, we now don't need to wait for our website to be fixed. So far, we had to wait unknown amount of time for our server to get fixed. The reason why KAIST server computer dead is because it couldn't handle all the traffics made by course applications. Extending server computer would make this possible, so students will experience a comfortable environment, not waiting for an hour.

 Second, I've heard that KAIST's internet speed is very slow, not like the internet in Seoul. If we change our server computer, we will be able to use rich server resources. It would make our university websites faster so students will get less stress. Less stress can lead to good studying performance. As a science researching university, this is going to be very important.

 In conclusion, I would like to change our university's server cause if we do that, we now don't need to wait when we apply course applications, and KAIST's overall webserfing speed will get faster. I hope someday it becomes real, not just in my imagination."	3.5	4	4	11.5
1781	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I get the huge power to change single important thing in KAIST, I want to change the ABC grade rules to S or U (satisfactory or unsatisfactory) grade rules. I will tell you some reasons why I want to change this rule below. 
First, ABC grade policy is very rough to students. Students have to study very hard to get the good grade. For instance, most of the subject related to Math in KAIST is known as 'devil's subject'. Because the content of the subject is about high level math and It follows ABC rules. And also it's name is related to the second reason.
Next, ABC policy makes forced competition between KAIST members. Math subjects are famous of following the 343 rule strictly which is deviding student into A grade, B grade, C grade by 3:4:3 proportion. So students want to reach 30% of score distribution and they have to compete with each other. It makes another problem. Some could think their friends not companion, but competitor. It will make indivisualism mood on KAIST and let another student to get the thought of competition. Now let's think about 'devil's subject' again. Only few of students attend to Math subject so there are vey high competition mood. It makes student feel tired, too.
Someone can say that competiton mood is good for motivating students' learning. But I don't think like that. Most of KAIST students have high motivation to reach their dreams. So, they already wants to study hard. We don't need that mood to pressure and give stressness to KAISTians.
Finally, It makes teaching assistants also known as TAs feel tired. Because of the grading policy, they have to evaluate students detaily. So they should schedule exams, quizes and make the problems to solve. Except the TA works, TAs are already very busy doing their jobs and It will make them feel tired.
These are the reasons why I want to change the ABC grade rules into SU grade rules. I don't know others thought is same as me but I believe that someone who read by writing could change their mind. Thank you for reading my article. "	3	3	2.5	8.5
1782	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Are you in school dormitory now? These days, because of COVID-19, we can not attend off-line classes. In my case, i maybe don't go school dormitory. Due to online classes  there are so many hards. First of all, we are hard to listen any opinions and informations from our seniors. And during classes, there are so many hards from simple errors to questions. So, i want to make offline community fresh men guide line or menual.

First, as i said before, fresh men have many difficults. we already have a group class, but students who didn't go university are hard to get closer  to them. For these people, i want a online-community that fresh men can ask questions about the thing that they didn't understand or conern. Fresh men can easily get information about university life, certain subject, or future  life.

Next, for this community, we can easily know what students thinks uncomfortable. When community active, we can easily heard their opinion. These datas will tell us what university have to change to improve university life. Therefore,these data will make university life more comfortable.

Finally, we can notify more effectly. if offcial answer apply, students feel less confused. Previous questions make other students more clearly. Therefore they might understand announcement clearly. 

Off-line fresh men guide line community solve fresh men's difficults, and for these community we can improve our university life. also it can clearfiy about notify.  For these reasons, i think making off-line fresh men guide line community make a positive effect. What things make your university life hard? Just post it!"	3	4	2.5	9.5
1783	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  There are lots of things in KAIST that we can do in our free time. We can just walk since the campus is big enough to walk around. In the past, not 2020 or 2021, many students who enjoy playing sports went to the Sports Complex. In Sports Complex, there are swimming pool with a lot of lane, a big track to run, and badminton courts etc. In this summer, I had to take a taxi to play badminton or go swimming because the Sports Complex was not opened. So, If I could change one thing about KAIST, I would like to open the Sports Complex for following specific reasons.
  First, not opened Sports Complex can make students' health worth. As I mentioned before, we have to spend a lot of time and money when we want to go badminton or swimming pools which are not in KAIST. For example, in this summer vacation, when I went to swimming pool alone in the Daejeon Worldscup Sports center, I had to pay 15000won for taxi and 4500won for swimming pool. On the other hand, for the Sports Complex in KAIST, I just need to pay only 3000won. Also, I spend 50minutes to go the Sports center and come back to my dormitory, but it takes less than 5 minutes to go the Sports Complex. Since we can not easily approach sports, we can avoid doing exercise easily. Because doing exercise regularly is essential for out good health, through this course, students' health are getting worse relatively when the Sports Complex is opened.
  Second, opened Sports Complex can make campus more friendly. There are many ways to make friends in the campus. One of the greatest ways to make friends easily is making friends while playing sports together. For example, on spring, I make more than 10 important friends while I was playing badminton. Running and doing team game together can make friendship between players. If the Sports Complex would be opened, many people in KAIST can make variable friends in there while doing sports or exercise. These kinds of things will make campus more friendly.
  I wrote about two reasons why I would like to open the Sports Complex, for students' health and more friendly campus. It has not been opened because of COVID-19.  I hope that COVID-19 gets better in Daejeon and Korea,  so the Sports Complex can be opened. "	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
1784	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change one thing about KAIST, I would improve dormitory's condition. Last semaster, I lived in Areum Dormitory in KAIST. Including Areum,  many dormitories in KAIST are too old, and there are many problem in them. So I think it would be repaired. I will support my point of view with 3 reasons.
First, dormitorys' Internet connection is not good. Dormitory is the place where students take their classes, do their assignments, and take rest. Most things students do in dormitory need good wifi connection and fast speed of internet. However, in dormitory, wifi is often not working. So, some people, like my roommate, had to buy wire to use internet. It interrupts students to study and makes them annoyed.
Second, dormitory is very messy. There are lots of dust in places where everyone uses, such as room for rest and hallway. It is not good for students' health. And due to bad sanity, there are many insects in dormitory. Although there are many plants near dormitories, there are too many bugs in dormitories. Last semaster, I found web of spider and lots of spider children in my room.  I think insects living in dormitory with people is not desirable. I think hiring more staffs for dormitory cleaning would be necessary.
Third, many equiptments in dormitory are broken and not working. For example, in shower room, half of shelves which I can put my shower basket on are broken, and water leaks from water hose. Using these equiptments in bad condition is very uncomfortable. It directly affects students' lives, so I think they should be repaired as soon as possible.
Likewise, dormitory has lots of problems in it. Bad Internet condition, sanity, and equiptments' condition deprive students' life quality. KAIST should set more budget for dormitories and improve them because good living place is connected to students' welfare. So, I insist that dormitories' condition should be improved."	4.5	4	3	11.5
1785	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" If I could change one thing of our university, I want to change the process of registerating lecture using KAIST site. In our university, we register the lecture that we want to take on the next semister before the semister start. I want to change this process because it has a lot of error. I'll give reasons below.
 First, because KAIST has many students, a server of the KAIST site is getting hardship of accepting all students to register a lecture. It results in broken down server. So, when I try to access on KAIST site and register a lecture, the server is broken down in few minuite, and we have to wate 1  hour, or more, untill the server is rebuilded and register a lecture that I want. In this point, we can think that it's natural for university that has many students, but my brother, attending another university, doens't have some error when he register a lecture. In other word, broken down server is not a usuall phenomenom. We have to change the process of registerating lecture to solve this error.
 Second, the process of registeration is random, and it can make some students hard to achieve the need of KAIST's rule. By the rule, we should get at least 12 points in 1 semister, but since the process is all random, some students' registeration can all be declined. I really saw a student that failed to join all of the lecture he wanted. If it happens, the student  must fill 12 points at class changing season, but it's hard to join the class since almost all  classes are filled, and just a few left. Also, it's hard to arrange time of the classes in our flavor. So, I think it's not a good and fair process for everyone.
 For these reasons, I think the process of registerating lecture is not efficient and fair for all students, so if i could change one thing, I should change it."	3	3	2	8
1786	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change one thing about my university, it is almost impossible but I would change location of my university. Most of major university in Korea is located in Seoul or around Seoul while our university is located in Daejeon. I think located in Seoul is better than Daejeon for the following reasons.
First, Seoul is better to get various experience for students. Seoul was capital of Korea, so there are a lot of palaces such as Kyeong Boek Goong palace. Also, Seoul is the most developed city in Korea. In my opinion,  as KAISTian, following science or IT trend is important  to be a leader of  new trend. Seoul is good place to study it. Daejeon is also good, but can't win Seoul.
Second, more students who are talented can consider KAIST. When I prepared for university exam, some of my friends are excluded KAIST because of its place. They said it is too far and less thing to do. For me, it takes almost three to four hours to go KAIST. Also, it requires a lot of money. I think it is wrong that students who clever enough to come KAIST give up to apply because of its location. I think we can solve this problem by changing location of KAIST to Seoul. Actually, KAIST already made AI doctor course buildings in Seoul.
Third, students can communicate with other universities. As I mentioned before, most of major university in Korea is located in Seoul. I heard some of KAISTians are not confident to their school, because they can meet only KAIST people during university life. If they meet other university students and recognize their pros, they can live better life. Also, realize their cons and try to overcome will make us better person.
Location of school is especially important in Korea, because of unbalanced region development and university. However, I think minus factor is much more than plus factor that Kaist is located in Daejeon. In conclusion, If I could change on thing about my university, I would change location of my university to Seoul for better experience, more applications and communication."	4.5	4	4	12.5
1787	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"There are a lot of  dormitory cleaners for our comfortable campus life. Recently, in the other university, one dormitory cleaners  is dead by terrible work amount. As a result, many people are angry and i feel that we need some solution for these problem. It is not just the other university's  problem. These Issue happen in KAIST. So If i could change one important thing about my university, i would change the garbage policy of dormitory. I will write the problem in garbage dormitory.
 First, students don't separate trashes for plastic and food. Many students eat delivery food in dormitory, because of corona Virus. However in this situation there are some problems. After they eat delivery food, They just throw out there whole trash in garbage.  In garbage, the food trash and plastic trash are mixed in one. Thus many cleaners should separate by their hand and wash the food trash.  it is very terrible work for them. So i think we have to make some CCTV for someone who don't separate their trash. and also make some policy that scold those students. I think this machine will make their life comfortable. 
 Second, university management office should expand the amount of cleaners. sometimes one cleaner clean whole floor of dorm. It lead to her stress. I think we have to pay more money for them. I think the work amount for each one cleaners is too much. We have to reduce this amount.
 Third, office should expand their size. When i throwed out something in garbge, sometimes the garbage was full.  As a result students just throw out their trash in the road or beside of garbage. Trash that was thrown out in road could be cleaned by cleaners. It is very uncomfortable work for them. Expanding garbage is not too difficult task, i think we need to solve their detail of difficulty.
 For these three reason, I want to change the garbage policy of dormitory. These action is not only just for cleaners, but also It will be helpful for us. As we make them happy, we can get more comfortable life in dormitory. Some people said that we don't need to mind the cleaners and job of cleaner is originally hard. However i think we have to change their mind. cleaners are one of the most important job in university. we have to treat them more comfortable and softly. Not only cleaners, we have to get some good observation for them who are suffered by terrible work and i'm sure that it  will return to us."	4.5	4	3	11.5
1788	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I think KAIST should change the location of campus. Seoul would be better than Daejeon for several reasons.
 The first reason is, in Korea, there are very many people who live in Seoul. In KAIST, also many students live in Seoul, too. Of course, Daejeon is the city which located in center of Korea. But If you consider the people density, Seoul is better location than Daejeon.
 Second, as many people live in Seoul, convenient transportation is in Seoul. People can use airplane, subway, train and bus to move easily. In Daejeon, there are also subway and bus, but they are not convenient. There are only one line on subway, so it is hard to use subway to move. And the subway station is far from KAIST, so students usually don't use the subway. But, in Seoul, there are almost 10 lines so students could use subway easily. And also the bus comes very fast. If KAIST is located in Seoul, more students can reduce time and money to move.
 Third, It would be more opportunity to study with high-level universities in Seoul. Korea has the serious unbalance problems by cities. For university, almost every good things are located in Seoul except IST. It is to reduce the unbalance, but in reality, It's good for KAIST students that KAIST in Seoul. Because the students can study or research with other university students to grown. In Daejeon, there are few universities much as Seoul. So students can meet more brilliant students to learn more.
 Finally, there are several reasons why the campus in Seoul is better than Daejeon. In Korea, there are much unbalance between Seoul and other cities, so it's good for KAIST students to study in better conditions."	2.5	4.5	3.5	10.5
1789	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Everything is wonderful in my university, but if I can change one thing, I want to change location. Daejeon is great city, but I think there is no reason to establish KAIST in here. I have 2 reasons of why I want to change location from Daejeon to Seoul.
 First, students in KAIST usually come from Seoul. There is no guarantee for Daejeon student, so every stduent in Korea starts on same line. Students live in Seoul usually go to academy in Seoul, and academy in Seoul is the most expensive and has the most highest quality of class. Also, Seoul has more student than Daejeon because Seoul is captial of Korea. Therefore, in Kaist, many students come from Seoul. When students which come from Seoul want to go their home, they can use KTX. It takes almost 1 hour. 1 hour is not long, but pay for KTX is 21 dollar. It is very expensive for university students.
 Second, Seoul has a lots of things. In Daejeon, there are almost nothing to play and enjoy. KAIST students are in age which want to enjoy a lots of things. Seoul has a lots of entertainment like amusement park, department store, zoo, pc room. Also, Soeul has a lots of university, businesses and labs. It is good for KAIST students because we can visit their easily and cooperating project can be more easily. Because of this reason, AI subject in KAIST will move to Seoul. 
 When I choose university last year, some of my friend choosed Yeonsae university and not KAIST. I asked reason, and they just said becuase Yeonsae university in Seoul. Many students in KAIST are from Seoul, and they give up a lots of things in Seoul. Changing location can't be come true because it spends a lots of money and reasons are not so serious. However, if it is possible to move to Seoul, quality of students daily life will improve."	2.5	2.5	3	8
1790	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"What I want to change is about COVID-19.
I think COVID changed most people's daily life, but especially  in university.
First, We listen every lecture in Zoom or recorded video, which decrease ability of studying.
In this situation, university cannot estimate student ability, so they give S/U or higher grade than past standard. 
In other university case, student who got lowest score got grade B+, so he feel he don't need to study hard.
Of course, I never listen lecture in face-to-face, but my brother who has listened lecture in face-to-face has many interconnection with his professor and studies harder than me.
Also, by having social distance, we cannot make new social connection, even existing connection. 
Freshmen usually hang out with their new friend in university by having dinner, drinking and playing.
But now, We can't stay more than 2 after 6pm, so no time for hanging out. 
As a result, If I could change one thing, COVID disappear in our life or are ignored in our life. "	1.5	1.5	2.5	5.5
1791	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"         Have you ever been abroad? When you go abroad, your perspective on the world widen normally. I think Many students want to attend universities outside their home countries because they want to widen view. There are three reason for why  I think that going abroad widens people's perspective.

      First of all, different countries have different cultures.  People who go abroad can experience how people from different cultures live.  For example, if they go to India, they can try the food with their hands. Not only that, but they can accept the good things about good points of other cultures. 
 
      Second, they can learn a language. People who go to some country get a chance to hear and speak the language of that country. For example, if they go to Spain, they can develop their Spanish skills. Furthemore, if they go the country of  Englishs speaking, they can develop global communication skills because English is a common language around the world.

      Finally, if people go to a more developed country to study, they can have a better level of learning. They can learn the latest techniques what they want to learn. If they go to Germany, they will be able to learn the latest automobile technology. They can have a chance to see outstanding experts in the field which they want to study. If they go to USA, they can see Bill Gates.

1792	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"Have you ever seen a friend who went to study abroad? Some students choose schools or universities outside their home countries. Anyone can think that going abroad is not good choice because it takes too much money and too long time. However, there are three advantages of studying abroad. 
 First, studying abroad is very good for learning the language of the other country. It is because you should always speak and hear the other language. There are many people who go abroad to learn not only english, but also the other languages. 
 The next advantage is that you can experience the culture of the other countries . Studying abroad may make you excited because it is like travel. You can think it is just travel, but it is very long travel. For studying abroad, you will live in other countries during its period. You can get many experiences from the other culture and it will make your vision wide.
 Finally, attending universities outside your home countries is for your studying and researching. It is the basic concept of studying abroad. If some sections which you want to study is researched well in other countries, you will want to go there and study with a professor who is an expert of that section. It is not that the professors in our countries are bad. It is just because each professors has different best sections which they research. Anyway, in this situation, studying abroad is the best choice for your studying.
  To sum up, studying abroad is for your ability of languages, experiences of the other culture, and best studying. If you should decide to study abroad or in your home country, I recommend going abroad. It will be the good experience for you. Do not worry for adopting other countries, you can do it and enjoy the studying in the other country."	3.5	4	4	11.5
1793	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"Nowadays, technology of airplane is revolute so far and many students attend schools overseas. Of course, studying abroad is often more difficult and expensive than studying in hometown. Therefore, we can predict that studying abroad has some benefits for some students. I think students study abroad because of experience about different culture, revoluted technology and challange.
          First, studying abroad give a chance to experience different culture of other countries. Each countries have their own culture if other people not visited there. Language can be one example of different culture. Like British accent or American accent, there are different types of accent and expression that foreigners not know. Studying abroad can make students to experience several culture of each countries.
         Second, students can study more revoluted technology from other countries. EU has the world's largest accelerator, CERN. Like this case, other countries can have better technology in student's major. Students can experience and study about technology easier if they study abroad.
         Briefly, different culture of foreign countries, revoluted technology, and challanging make students to study abroads. Students can experience culture like language or festival that they cannot experience at their hometown.

1794	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"    Many students go to different countries to study, But it's not a easy thing to do. Because you have to have good grads and you have to fit in at new cultures. Why do those high-scorers go to different countries to study eventhough it's hard? I'm going to talk about the two reasons why students study abroad.
    The first reason is because of the new envirenments. When you goto other countries, you can be in a new envirenment of people. Meet new professors, new friends, new roommates and so on. Thus, there can be a new envirenment for studing or researching. For example, if you attend universities that are known with science, then you can't be in a better place to do your scientiffic research. If you attend universities that are known with dances, then you can't be in a better place to dance. Therefor, you can pick a country that has a well develloped envirenment about the things you want to study, and even give a wider view of the world. 
    The second reason is it can grow the power of doing something yourself. When you are away from home, you wil not be able to ask everything to your mom or  your dad. This way, you have to make a lot of dissisions your self and you can even fail by your choices. Eventhough you can fail, you will learn a lesson by your self, and become a independent person. 
    To sum up, the benefits for students going to study in other countries are geting in to new and well develloped envirenments, and becoming an independent person. These strenght of learning in other countries, makes lot of students want to study abroad. If you get the chance of going to a different countries to study, why don't you take the chance and do your research at the best envirenment, and become an independent person?"	3.5	4.5	3	11
1795	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"A frog in the water tank'. It is a Korean sentence. In this sentence, frog means someone who pretend to know everything  while they know very small things. When I traveled U.S.A, I thought that I was a frog. Many people think this sentence when they go abroad. Furthermore, some students decide to study abroad. However, studying abroad is difficult. To go abroad and adapt new environment is hard. Then, why do they study abroad? I think they study abroad because of foreign language and speical experience.  
First, to study foreign language, they go abroad. Thesedays, to learn foreign language is important. Even we are studying math and science, we should present to global people. We may work at global company. Like these reasons, to learn foreign language is important. English is basic, someone needs to know another language. We can learn language in our country, but the best way to learn language is going and living abroad. If we go abroad, we have to speak on foreign language to live there and we always hear foreign language. To learn language well, living and studying abroad is the best choice. So they decide to study abroad  to learn language.
Second, studying abroad is unique experience. We remember going aborad specially. New environment,  new students, new professor, and their view(way to think) will be speical experience, and they will be good to spead the area of mind.  I've been Russia to present my report, after visiting there, I find out a lot of things like Russian life, importance of English, views of foreign people about my study, etc. We find out many things from new experiences. In my case, it was only a week, if I study abroad for a semester or year., I will find out more things. For new experience, students study abroad.
In conclusion, many students study abroad because they can learn foreign language much easier and better, and they can get special experience. Just traveling abroad is also good experience, studying abroad has much better experience. However, there are some difficulties such as costs, adaptation, or difficulty of study, so everyone can't study abroad.  But, even short studying abroad, it will be a good experience for your life. In addition,  there are some ways to help you studying abroad in KAIST. So, how about using this way to study abroad? Not to become a 'frog'."	5	4	3	12
1796	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	" What do you think is the advantage of foreign countries? They can have better social systems, education, public welfare, etc. Not all, but there are good things about foreign countries than our home country. Because of that, many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. I will talk about the three reasons that why do some students study abroad.
 First of all, they can study foreign languages. If students go to foreign schools or universities, they will be a master of the language of the country where school or university are located. They have to speak, listen, write, and read with that language, so it is very helpful to learn foreign languages. To addition, there can be different foreign students that they are also studying abroad from different countries. It can be a opportunity to learn another foreign languages when talk with abother student that studying abroad.
 Second reason is that they can get better education than their home countries. Most of students who want studying abroad choose the schools or universities in advanced countries like America. Advanced countries have very good education. Their education systems, schools, classes, teachers, even classmates are of good quality. Also their socials are have benefits to study. Several companies act for education like donation.
 Finally, the foreign countries have a wide range of education. Korean education mainly consists of major subjects like math, science, laws etc or money making subjects like economy, engineering etc. Because of that some of students can not study about what they want. However, some foreign countries teach more various than our home country. Also some countries teach different subjects because of social perception.
 To sum up, many students study abroad because of foreign languages, better education, and a wide range of education. Of course you can study in your home country enoughly, because our home countries are trying to improve education. However, if you have a goal to studying, then studying abroad is worth thinking about."	3.5	3.5	2.5	9.5
1797	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"           In KAIST, I have seen a lot of students who study abroad. What do you think about that? Some people think it is a waste of time because it takes too many times to go forein countries and adapt to foreign life. However, if it is a waste of time, why so many students visit forein countries to study? I think attending schools or universities outside their home countries is a great idea for several reasons.
           First, it is a good chance to communicate with foreign people. It is getting easier to communicate with foreign people. If students can have a chance to practice communicating with foreign people as studying abroad, they will become much more professional when they work with foreign people. Furthermore, a lot of students who attend Korean universities study as using English. Students who have great English skills can study well in Korea, too.
           Second, it is a good chance to have new experience. There are experience that can't experient in home countries. For examples, some areas are very important in some countries, while not important in other countires. If students can study some areas which are not considered significantly in home countires deeply, they will become very professional in home countries. Also, the students in foreign countries have studied different curriculum. If students have chance to debate with the foreign students, they will be able to get some new ideas.
           To sum up, studying in foreign schools or universities can be a great idea for students because it is a good chance to communicate with foreign people and have new experience. Skills to communicate with foreign people is useful for not only working with foreign people, but also studying in Korea. Also, students can study new areas outside their home countries and debate with the foreign students. There are a lot of opportunities to studying abroad for students. I recommend you to get the opportunities if you want to become proffesional in the global era."	4.5	4	3.5	12
1798	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"There are many students who go to shcool or university outside their home countries. In recent years, the number of international students has increaased. If then, what is the advantage of study abroad? Let's talk about the advantage of sutdy abroad.

First reason is that we can make many international friends. When we go to school or university outside the home country, it will be alone with a high probability. Then we need to make friends to adapt new circumstance. If we still contact this friends when we came back to hom country, it will be a good connection and it will benefit us someday.
Second reason is we can learn the culture of other countries. Different countries have each unique culture such as food culture, clothes culture and so on. At first, it won't be easy to adapt to other cultures. However, as we understanding their cultures, their culture will influence on your thought and behavior.
Laset reason is that we can learn language of another countries. If we learn new language, we can think the word meaning.
In conclusion, go to school outside the home country give us many good benefit. We can make many international friends, we can learn another country's culture and languague. For this reasons I think study abroad will grow you to international student."	3	3.5	3.5	10
1799	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	" Have you ever go abroad outside your home countries? I have that experience. It make me be adults and I can get divese ability. If you go abroad outside your home countries, you can study not only math, science and studying wih book but also social ability and environment. For now, I will explain why do some students study abroad.
 First reason is that human being must be comfortable in home countries. If they are comfortable when they study in their home countries, they can go alseep when they study in relaxing places. When you study, relaxing is not good things. Relaxing makes human lazy. If relaxing makes you lazy, studying can't have good effective. So students go abroad, they can have little anxiety. Little anxiety can study effectively.
 Second reason is that most students want to study not only math, science, normal subject and etc. Most students want to study other countries' envirnoment. If we study same school or universities, we must see same landscape, mountains, sea and etc. It makes students boring. If students study same place, they must think that their life is boring and studying is too boring. 
 Third reason is that students can study other counties' culture and then they can get high quality of  understanding ability and social ability. If students study abroad, they can meet other countries' students. It make students wide sight. In global, many students study in their home countries. They have other ability, other culture, other talking ability. It can make students get not only studying with book also social ability. Social ability makes students be more adults and social ability can't get in relaxed place.

 From now, I explain why do some students study abroad. First, students can't stduy in their home countries effectively. Second, students want to experience diverse environment. Lastly, students can get high quality of social ability and understanding ability. For these reasons, some students want to study abroad. Honestly, we can't study everything in our home countries. We must meet other countries'student and experience diverse environment. Diverse experience and environment make you have wide sight. It is good choice to study go abroad."	3	3.5	2.5	9
1800	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	" As transportation and internet are developing, the communication with other countries is easier than past. Therefore the number of students who choose to study abroad is increasing. In my case, I can see some friends who are not Korean in KAIST or my friends who are preparing for studying abroad. What is the advantages for studying abroad? In this essay, I will write about my thoughts that have two reasons for studying in other countries.
 First, they can upgrade their ability of languages. Because they should talk language of other countries, their language ability will be increased. Not only language of that countries, but also english ability will be increased. In my case in KAIST,  I can see some of people came from outer countries were talking using english to communication. At that time, I thought ""Altough their first time in Korea was hard, nowadays they can talk easily using english!"" Knowing language of other countries is important because we can talk with many of people.
 Second, students who are study in other countries can learn about different culture. They can know about the climates, the clothes, the foods, etc. They will be interested in some culture and these new experiences won't be forgetted. In my case, I went to abroad when I was young, such as Taiwan, austrailia. In outer countries, I should eat different foods, feel different climates. However, difference with Korean culture made me excited. At that time, I decided to go to many countries in adult because I want to feel outer countries' culture.

 To summarize, Studying in outer countries will be good experience for students. They can upgrade their ability for languages or english and learn about different culture. After reading this article, I hope you to go abroad for studying. "	4	3.5	2.5	10
1801	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"    Recently, thanks to the fast transportation and share of information due to the Internet, numerous students have studied abroad. Mainly, many students go to the US, UK, or some Western countries in Europe. Those countires have in common that have good facility and well-educated. I want to suggest that since students can have nice education, relationship with many different kinds of people, and availability of getting a job aborad.
    First, students can receive the best education. This is because thanks to the good facilities and well-educated professors, students can listen to much better lecture and get nice answer to their questions about their major. Moreover, students can get a chance to have native-speaker friend or attend foreign language lecture so that they can learn and increase language skill much faster.
    Second, they can communicate with diverse kinds of people. Since a school or an university can be a field of meeting from different countires, students can meet many people from the different culture. They can learn the other cultures or can teach them their culture. Besides, as there are some people who became successuful like CEO of a company or a professor. Since having connection with them can help them having jobs or doing several social activities, students hope to be one of the students in nice school.
    Last, it is much easier to get a job abroad. Like content I mentioned in the second paragraph, there is a social connection between university and numerous companies. Since friends in a company can give some tips about an interview or introduction, knowing an aquaintance or a friend in company is very helpful. Furthermore, although there are numerous intelligent people from the other countries, it is obvious that the comanies prefer people from the universities in their home country because they commonly much better to communicate and work with them.
    It is apparent that studying aboroad provides several benefits and experiences that help student to design their lives. I also want to study abroad and if you have a chance to attend school in another country, it will be marvelous to go there and experience numerous things."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1802	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"Some students leave their home countries to study.

  What is your dream? When you were in the elementary school, I think you did not think about your real dream yet, just played with your friends. However, few years later when you were in high school, probably you had a dream. Then you considered your future from that point and the most important one is university. You can get high level class in there and it will be a very big help to you  to reach to the goal. However, if there is no appropriate college near to you, you cannot get information easily. Then you will find the university outside your home countries. So, today I argue that some students study abroad because of appropriate department of their dreams and high level classes.
  First, for some minor subjects, some universities have no class for them. Most colleges have departments for very major subjects such as mathematics, engineering, music, and languages. If your dream is related to these kind of department, you can easily to get information from the university. However, if you want to study some unique subjects, some college may not have a class about them. Then you must find other university and if you find it, it can be placed outside your home countries.
  Second, you want to join high level class for your dream. Nowadays, many students study hard to go to the top class universities. It means they want to get the better class and also if you graduate one of those colleges, you get huge advantages for your dream. When a company hire employees, they see what university did you graduate and the university is in high level, the company really want you more. After you get a job, you can do your work easily based on high quality class.
  To sum up, some students choose abroad university because of appropriate and high quality class. You have to go to college that has a department related your interest. If some universities have your department, then you will choose the best university. Studing abroad is good way to catch your dream."	4	4	3	11
1803	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"  Did you have the schools or universities that you want to go? Many students want to go to famous universities, and get a good class. In addition, some students want to go universities outside their home countries. Like this, we can see the students who study abroad in mordon life, and we will find the reasons.
  The first reason is that the students want to get a good class like I said in intro. Many students want good teacher and proffeser. In some case, their are in other countries. So, students go to outside. For example, the student in Korea want to get a class by Harverd proffeser, then he or she should go to USA  and go Harverd. In addition, more deeper you study, then the informations in home countries are not enough in many case. Therefore, they go outside.
  Second, follow the parents. If the student's parents have to go other countries long time by job or other things, then most of  student go with them. For example, my friend's father go to india for work, and the all family go to india. Of course, my friend study at school in india.
 The Last  reason, to study word. For example, I am not good at english, and if I go to USA to study, then I have to use english in there, so my english will be better. Like this, some students go to outside home countries to learn word. In this case, schools or universities are additional thing.
  To sum up, many students study abroad in three reasons, want to get a good class by teacher or proffeser who are in other countries, follow the parents, to study word. Therefore if you want to go outside home countries, then do not scared! You are not the only student study abroad."	3	3.5	2	8.5
1804	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"What are the differences between schools or universities inside and outside our home countries? These days, Many students choose to attend schools of universities in the foreign countries. Let's take a look at two reason; to study with intelligent people and to experience other cultures.

First reason is to study with intelligent people. Many intelligent students in the world apply to the popular foreign universities, such as Oxford of Harvard. Becasue these universites have high quality of education. Students can discuss about what they consider with many intelligent friends, and these experiences enhance their thinking ability. There are also many popular professors or researchers in those universities. To learn and discuss with them are the benificial experiences for students.
Second reason is to experience other cultures. These days, 'global' is one of the most important keywords to success. Experiences at other countries are great chances to learn other cultures. Oppertunity to understand other countries is good for breaking students' bias and having wide view. In addition, learning foreign language is another benefit of attending foreign universities. To communicate foreign students, they have to use foreign languages. It makes students' foreign language ability better.
In closing, many people prefer to study abroad because they want to study with brilliant people and understand other countries more. Nowadays, it is not a special case to study abroad. If you are interested in foreign university, consider your new life in the universities outside your home countries."	4	4.5	3.5	12
1805	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"Why many students choose to go abroad universities to study? That is because going abroad has more special adavanages than in hometown.  that  Beside the disadvantage that the unviersity is far from his or her home, students attent farther school because it has advantages. Stduents attend abroad school for two reasons.
    First of all, stduents attend abroad school because they want to go unviersity where specifies in the subject what they want to learn. In the world, there are so many unviersities, and how advanced about each subjects is different for every universities. As students want to learn deeper and more advanced, they go to university where the subject is advanced even if the unviersity is not in home countries. For example, most of students who are interested in science and math want to go MIT, and most of students who are interested in politics want to go Harvard. Also, how advanced about the subject is related to the professor of that subject or lab. Famous and intelligent professors can make student more develope than others. For instance, some people came to KAIST not only KAIST is the best science advanced university, but also KAIST has many famous professors and the labs where make good results.
     Second, students go abroad unviersities to increase their foreign language skills. While they live in other country, students can learn foreign language faster than learning the language in their hometown. They have to survive at the new country, so they have to improve the language to live and not to have difficulties in abroad life. For exmaple, the reasons why Korean students go to US unversities are the quality of lecture and to improve their English skills. In addition, students can feel the culture of the country, so they can learn the language easily. The language is related to the culture of that society. They can feel and understand the culture of the country, so they can learn the language with experience and can write or speak more naturally as nations of the country.
    In summary, many stduents go to abroad unviersities because they can listen to more advanced lectures than hometown unviersities and can improve foreign language skills. If you attend  abroad university, it could be unfamiliar at first  because it is in foreign. However, the time will solve that uncomfortable. You can get several special opportunities in abroad which cannot given in your hometown universities. If you are interested in going abroad schools, then think about the speical advantages of abroad school and determine your decision."	4.5	4.5	2.5	11.5

However, in their own country, it may not has a environments for study which they want to do. Moveover, if some countries are very popular for the studies and have a good technology, students want to learn it.  So some students think they have to go abroad and learn about the higher level skills and technology of their dream.
Second reason is that they can have a wide sight of the study. There are many other country's students in abroad. So they can communicate with them and can have a discussion while they are study. In their own country, students may have same views about the thing which they want to study because of some situation which their country have. However, other country's students may have opposite oppinion about it. Therefore, they can have a wide sight of the studies while talking in abroad.
Third, study in abroad is very good experience for their future. Some students want to study other countries language for their dream, and go to the country which use the language is the best choice to study other countries language. In addition, they can know other country's culture and life style while they are studying.

Do you see foreign in your school or university? Recently, various people who from other country study with us and a lot of Korean also study abroad. Studying abroad can give a lot of experience and a chance to learn from famous professor. These are the reasons why students study aborad. I want to tell more detail of them. 
First, we can get a lot of experience. In other country, there are lots of difference compare to own countries like food or culture. We can learn about that when we live there. These experiences give us benefit when we work or study something. For example, if we set our own restaurant in India and we do not know some people in there don't eat pork, we cannot earn a lot of money.
Second, we can study with famous professor in the part which you want to learn. Some students want to learn more about thier interesting part, and a professor who famous for the part works in abroad. Then, they determine to study abroad.
To summarize, studying abroad can give lots of expereinces which learn other culture, and give a chance to learn from professor who they are respect. If you want to learn more other countries or deep in studying, you will have to consider studying abroad."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

Korea is also good option. However, there are some people that studying in foriegn countries is much better option. Students who study abroad because it can be the special experience and the good chance to learn.
 First, studying abroad is special experience. Usual people have visited foreign countries just for travelling, and also there are people who have not visited a foreign country yet. Living in the another country is an unusual and special experience for itself. Not just for living culture, the way to study is different in foriegn countries. Studying in different ways is also helpufl experience.
 Second, studying abroad can be better chance to learn than studying in their home country. Foreign people have different cultural background and different perspective. If we meet them and interact with them,  we will have broader perspective. Another good point is learn English even fast. We use English when we should communicate with foreign people. It is clear that the longer time we use English, the easier learning English is.
 In short, studying abroad can provide special experience and good environment to learn new things. You should go abroad and study, live there if you like new challenge."	3	3.5	3	9.5
1809	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"""The frog in the well"" This is the korean traditional saying. It means person who experienced less than other people.  There are several ways to get out of frog, but going abroad studying is certain way.  I think some students study abroad because we can experience more thing that we can't experience at our country
 First, there are knowledge what we can't learn from our country. Each country has a diffrent field of research. So, it if very helpful to go to a country where the desired field is well studied and study about it. Sure we can learn that knowledge from internet. But it is better to learn directly to learn details more. Also, even if the level of research isn't absolutely higher than our country, it can be helpful to go and study. We can compare the knowledge and know-hows with our thing's and devlope our style with it. 
 Second, not just in studying, experiencing foreign lifestyles can help us. Since each country developed with different history, countries have different values and this appears in lifestyles. Experience various values makes us able to look at objects or some situations form many perspectives. This is very important and positive thing. Also if there is anything use ful in other countries' society, we can bring it to our country. Even if we can't bring it perfectrly, we can at least change our life more good.
 Because we can study more things and experience different lifestyles from other countries and it has a good effect to us, it is good choice to study abroad. But, I don't think it is necessary thing. If you are a frog who wants to get rid of well, there are many ways to experience various things with out abroad studying. I want you to know that you have to get away from experincing less,  being trapped in narrow thinking. And I suggest abroad studying in one of the nemerous ways.  "	3.5	4	3	10.5
1810	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"    In past, government tried to catch students not to study abroad, but now, there are lots of packages and plans for abroad studying. This is because students can learn more things by studying abroad, and this is helpful for the development of the country. Students can learn with English and understand foreign culture by studying abroad.
    First, students can study lectures with English in there. In students' home countries, lectures are usually written in their mother's language. In foreign schools and universities, usually use English, so students can naturally study English. Also, studying with English is helpful for students to extend their ideas global. They can learn more standard lectures that are not translated, so it is easy to prepare global presentations for global audiences.
    Second, students can understand about foreign cultures in there. Some students may choose foreign company for their future jobs. If they practice about how to behave well in other countries, their company life will be more comfortable. In addition, there are lots of foreigners in their home countries. By understanding foreign cultures, students can behave and communicate well with the foreigners in their countries.
    To sum up, for students, attending schools or universities outside their home countries has lots of benefits. Society is becoming global, so you should become more global person. If you want to prepare for global society, then consider studying abroad after COVID-19.

1811	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"Why students go abroad to attend universities
 Have you ever seen students who are from another countries? Some of my freinds went abroad to go universities and I can meet some foreign student in my university. Then, we can think why they choose to attend schools outside their home countries. I know two big reasons because my friends went schools in another country. 
 First, each nations are good at one specific part. Because the ways what nations are following are different, one specific part is famous on the world. MIT, KAIST are one of the famous science mechanic college, and there are many university like Stanford, Harvard, Johns Hopkins and so all.  Like this, some universities are famous in one specific part, too. So, students go outside their countries to find universities.
 Second, we can meet professor in university, if you want to meet a famous professor, you will choose universities outside your home countries. For example, we can choose universitiy to meet professors who get Nobel Prize or discover new principle. If we learn from professor who we want to meet, the efficiency will increase and we can ask about the part which we want to study for the professor. 
 In global generation, many students want to go out their nations to study abroad. Because students can choose to schools among many universities in the world if you can speak English. Students who want to study with your role model or study in famous university choose to attend schoole or universities in foreign countries. "	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

"When I was a middle school student, I have been to Japan for a week. I was so funny with new culture because it was my first experience to visit a foreign country. But I don't know where I visited in Japan or what I ate in Japan. It's because I was just funny, not interested in Japan. So, I want to visit Japan again to know well about Japanese culture. I will give some the reasons why I was funny and want to re-visit.
 The first reason is Japanese food has originality. Although all the countries have their own foods, I think Japanese food is special for Korean. Japan is near to Korea, but their foods are so different to our foods because of the different environment. Korea has three seas, Japan is a island. Japanese food use many things from the sea well, we can enjoy the delicious sea foods and we can experience that near countries can have different culture.
 Next, this visiting is for the right history. The relationship of Korea and Japan is so bad. Japan attacked and dominated Korea and Korean was hurt by Japan in 1900s. I want to visit the place where the tragedies occured like ship island(kunhamdo). Japan wants to make the history which they dominated korea nothing. I think Korea should stop it and know about the tragedies well. For that, I think visiting the places like ship island(kunhamdo) can help me know the right history.
 The last reason is that Japan is near to Korea. we can go Japan easily because Japan is near. And It is just my opinion. I have a little worry that something , which is like the car accident of my family happen when I am in too far country and just fear to the far countries. So, I want to start visiting near countries and then visit to far countries later. 
 In short, I want to visit Japan because we can experience that the different culture and out sick history and Japan is near. I want to visit many countries starting from Japan."	3	3	3	9

So I want to see famous Korean soccer star, Son's play on field and he is player of Totenham, Epl. So I want to visit England because of soccer.
Second, I want to see Europian life-style and culture. I didn't visit Europe yet, so I have curiosity of Europian life-style. Also, I watched the ""Bohemian rapsody"" and often listening Beatles. So I want to visited their home country, England.
At last, it could be a quiet simple reason. I like pronounsation of England. From drama ""Shalock"", I heard British English and it is attracting. So I want to visit England and listen to talk of them.

"I like going on a trip and meeting new people. But nowdays, because of the corona virus, I couldn't go to anywhere but my schcool or my house. So it had been a plesure of thinking about visiting a foreign country, and I will share my thoughts.
The foreign country I want to visit is Hawai. The first reason is because I really like to go swimming. but as I said, because of the corona virus I had no chance to go swimmimg. So I would love to go to Hawai and take a swim at the beautiful sea at Hawai. I saw a photo of the beach at Hawai and it was so beautiful. So this became my reason for having to go to Hawai, and the first thing to do when I really go to Hawai. The second reason is because I heard and saw a lot of people going on a summer vacation to Hawai, but I have never been to Hawai before. So I would like to know why all those people is going to Hawai, by going there my self. And find a difference of just ordinary places. The last reason is because I like warm weathers. In our country the weather is getting colder and colder every day. But I like being in hot places rather being in the cold places . So I would like to go to Hawai and enjoy little more time in the warm weather.
I think everyone will have different thoughts about the foreign country they want to visit. The weather, the actitvites and the length of taking a plane or a ship will give different meenings to people. Why don't you think about a foreign country you want to visit? Just thinking about it will make you happier during this corona pandemic."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

"I think almost korean university students want to go travel.  In fact, many students visit foreign countries. They used to go Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, etc. It's near and cheap. However, after earning and saving a lot of money, some students visit western country; U.S.A or Europe. Someone says Europe backpack trip is the most memoriable experience. I want to visit Europe, too. But, I really want to visit Germany.
 Which famous things of Germany can you think? Many people will say ""Beer"".  I will say same answer. I wonder how does it taste. I tried to drink can beer from Germany, it was not special. As you know, feeling between can beer and fresh beer is different. So, I want to drink  fresh beer in Germany. In addition, it holds 'October Fest' in Germany. I want to try that festival. When I was a highschool student, I think 'I will go to the October fest after becoming an adult. It holds on October, so if I want to go there, I should use Chuseok, or skip autumn semester. However, it will be good memory. 
 My favorite music genre is heavymetal. If I say like that in Korea, a lot of people are surprised. In Korea, there are few fans of heavymetal. Frankly, I also surprised  at my band which is KAIST heavymetal band, 'INFINITE'. Korea heavy metal bands are very old or not famous. When I watch Metallica concert through Youtube, it looks very very exciting. I want to be one person among them. In Germany, there are lots of famous bands which are active. Helloween, Scorpions, Sodom, etc. Surely, they are also old, but I want to feel exciting big heavymetal concert. 
 I also like to watch and play the soccer. My favorite team is Real madrid, but I often watch Bundesliga. If I visit Germany, I hope to watch Bayern Muinich(I can't remember exact speeling) and any teams which Korean leaguers play in match.(Jeong Woo yeong or Lee Jae Seong)

 First, USA has a lot of tour spots not to waste my 2 weeks. As I have two weeks, a long time, I would like to spend my free time while tour a large continent or country because I did not visited any large country due to short travel time. Small island or East-Asia countries are appropriate to travel for a short time, however, I believe I need to go a huge country as a large range of travel time if I travel for 2 weeks because there are so many landmarks and tour place to go as big as size of the country. Especially, there are many famous landmarks only on the west side of America, for example, Hollywood, Universial Studio, and Grand Canyon.

Not just players, the stadiums of MLB like Oracle Park(home of Sanfransisco Giants) and Fenway Park(home of Boston Red Sox) are so beautiful that I want to go there just to see the stadiums. Every time I watched MLB games through the internet or TV, I dreamed the situation that I watch the game in there. If I could go to America, my dream can come true.
 Second, There are many great engineers in America. I want to major the electronic engineering and mechanics. America is the best country in the engineering. There are some big industrial village like Silicon valley. If I visit America for two weeks, I will see how the best engineers work and learn many things about engineering as possible I can. Two weeks are not enough time to learn many things, but the experiences must be help to me.
 Last, but not least, I can see the many fossils in the museum. When I was young, I am interested in dinosaurs. There are also many fossils in Korea, but  most of them are  footprint fossils or egg fossils.  It is too hard to find the big bone fossils in Korea. But, In the America, there are large land and best experts in the world, so many bone fossils can be found. I want to see them in my own eyes, not through the monitor.
 These are three reasons that I want to vistit America. After the pandemic is end and I have enough money to travel, I will visit America and do the all things that I wrote in this essay. It must be one of the greatest experience in my life"	3.5	4	3	10.5
1830	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I want to visit Rusia for three reasons. 
First reason is that Rusia is communism. I don't know much about communism. Beacause I experienced only capitalism for my whole life.  I know communism's definition but I don't know communism people's life styles such as how they use money. So I want to know about it.  Also, I wonder how can Rusia keep doing communism while almost every other countries are using capitalism. There are many differences between capitalism and communism. What makes Rusia to overcome that differences? It can be their land size or millitary scale.  But, I'm not sure about the answer. So while visiting many history museames in Rusia, I want to figure out it.
Second reason is Rusia's cold weather. I think playing is very important part of traveling as much as studying that country. I choose Rusia to play with snow. I like snow and cold weather very much. But nowdays in Korea, the weather is to hot. There are few snowing days in winter. Of course, It's hard to play with snow. I guess I couldn't play with snow since I was 7. Rolling up my body with snow became a wish to me. I want to make my wish come true in Rusia.
Final reason is Rusia's liqour culture. I heard that they prefer high alchol degree. They have many other kind of liqour that isn't normal in korea like bodka. I know that they have much higher alchol degree than So-Ju. In youtube and SNS many Rusians drink that liqour just like an water. I wonder it's true or not. Anyway, in Korea, I have few chance to experience that culture. So, I want to taste many kind of liqour in Rusia."	3.5	3.5	2.5	9.5

If I have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks, I would visit European countries like Italy, France and Germany.

Although they recommended that kids do not play it, many kids play them. In fact, this problem is much devated. In this essay, I argue about that violent video games affect kids in a negative way for 2 reason.
 First, kids will be not afraid of violent things. Hating violent thing is normal mind. But kids watch violent thing in young age, they don't know why this is afraid thing. It is very dangerous because they can become don't afraid about crime. Also, it can be affect to kids become violent. They can hit or bullying other kids in school. In the other word, violent games can cause school bullying.
 Second, kids can be teached bad things by violent game. Adult can think which is bad thing or good thing, but kids can't think it well. So kids learn about bad words, crimes, etc. For example, think about that kids learn about bad word in game. Because they don't know that is bad word, they understand that this word is just used at angry moment. Therefore they can use it to other people. Also they can learn many crimes in game. So they can use in real and it will be crime.
 In conclusion, I argue about violent video games affect kids in a negative way. Although it has many reasons, I wrote 2 big reasons in this essay. First reason is kids be not afraid of violent things so kids become violent. Another reason is kids can learn about bad things in violent game. This becomes they can act bad behavior. Although violent games are dangerous to kids, they can easily play it in online. Therefore the law about regulating age in game must be reinforced."	4.5	4	3.5	12
1834	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" Many people vaguely think that video games have negative influence on children. My parents also thought like that, so I couldn't play video games when I was young. When I was young, I also thought violent games would have a negative affect, but when I look back, I think there war more positive affects than negative affects. Also, after learning science, I think we don't need to be afraid about violent games with prejudice.

 First, it is only a fear of the unknown things that violent video games will adversely affect children. Research on the effects of violent games is being actively conducted, but no clear correlation realationship has been revealed yet. Many people easly think that maybe violent games would make their kids also violent, but that is just a prejudice. After I started learning science, I knew that we should not think by our suspicion without evidence. This phenomenon is similar to be scared of AI for a reason that just we don't know about it exactly.

 Second, including violent games, video games are part of society for children. Young boys expecially get close through games.They get close by playing popular team games like LOL or sudden attack, but these games are violent. If you don't play that game just because it's violent, you will miss opportunity to hang out with your friends. Video games are already deeply rooted in student's culture. Of course, including violent video games. We should not avoid their culture. We should admit it, and help them play video games properlly.


 For these two reasons, I think violent video games have more positve affects than negative affects. I think we sholud not avoid violent games with prejudice, and think about their good points for kids."	3.5	3	3.5	10

And in these games, player fight with zombies and kill them or player be zombie and bite other people or kill other people. This can cause bad effect to children. Second, there are war game. Player can fight by driving tank or airplane. This kind of games are not really bad. But game that player fight as being a soldier and use various kinds of weapon is harmful.

     And then, I will explain the bad effects for kids when they play violent video games. First, they play with their friends with playing same rule of some kinds of violent video games. For example, they play war game and use fake gun or fake knife to kill each other. I also played war game when I was young. But, it is dangerous because fake gun or fake knife can harm other unfortunately. It can hurt eyes or fighting each other can cause severe injury. Second, they can feel life of other animal or other people is less important. Kids are young and they cannot think as adult do. They can act same as in violent games. For example, when they play animal killing simulation, it is possible that they kiil animal without any feeling. It can cause kids' bad thinking. Third, not only violent video games but most kind of video games are addictive. Kids do not have self-control abillity so that they can easily addicted to video games.

1836	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"   Do you think that violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Almost adults agree with that violent video games affect kids in a negative way, so South Korea has shut-down law that kids can't play games after 10pm. If they want to play video games, they must wait for 7 hours. Since I was at elementary school, I think that it is unfair because everybody has freedom to play video game. However, after I became adult, my opinion change to agree with violent video games affect kids in a negative way. There are some reasons and details to support my opinion.
   First, violent video games can grow their violence. Kids imitate that they saw. For example, one kid in America saw Superman at TV and it made a terrible tragedy. He climbed up his house's roof and fell down during imitate Superman's flying motion. After he died, many people think that we should show good image to kids. Even that, adults get violence by violent video games. When we watch news, we can find that some people murdered other people because they fought in video games occasionally. If we allow that kids could play violent video games, they will get violence, so they will doing bad behavior to their family and friends.
   Furthermore, kids will do only video games. They can be addicted easily, so they easily fall into addiction. We should grow their dream for their life and our future. The elementry school teach not even several subjects, but also how to make friends, how to make a good social life and how to talk well. The period of teenager is important to make thier personality. If kids fall into video game addiction, they will hate to go elementry school. Therefore, kids will do not participate well at their class. 
   Lastly, kids will spend a lot of money at video games. Nowadays, video games guide to spend money. Kids want to spend moeny because their character will  become stronger. Children have less sense of money. Children must be prevented from video games to protect their family's money.
   In conclusion, Violent video games affect kids in a negative way. That can grow their violence and kids easily fall into addiction. Thus, we should banned violent video games for our kids's future.       "	5	5	4	14

It makes people feel refreash and happy. However, video games have own proper age of playing the game. It means that there are some problems for playing of children. This essay argues that video games affect kids in a negative way.
  First, players cannot concentrate after they play games. After people play violent video games, they still think about play that they did in game. For example, when they made a mistake for one situation, they think better ways of playing game after they finished the game. It cause people not be able to concentrate on work, especially kids. Also, child who cannot control their feeling can be easily addicted. For example, WHO made a dicision to think games addiction for sick means that game addiction is serious problem. Child should study or think about their future because they don't have enough chance to build their dream in childhood. Video games disturb child to be sure of their dream, so child should not be able to play violent games.
  Next, Most of the violent games have item to buy, but child have no vision for using money. Most of games have items to use or make player stronger than other players. For example, in Sudden attack, players should buy their own character and gun to win against someone in Internet. Nexon, owner of Sudden attack, makes the box that give players the nice item randomly. It makes players to buy more and more box for their money. Not only adults but also child should buy items to win, but people should know how to use and save money by learning during their childhood. 
  Lastly, they can use bad words after they play violent games. EBS, the broadcast for student, had reseach of using bad word. In this result, students who use bad words cannot think many ways and words than students that use less bad words. Children have to think larger world and dream because childhood is only chance to dream clearly. If children could't imagine their own world, they have not had creativity. Also, the sight of elder for using bad words is bad and elder have negative sight of that children. Children are people that adults should protect them, but When people have bad feeling of someone, they would not want to help that he or she. .
  In conclusion, violent video games affect kids in a negative ways for 3 reasons. Games affect kid cannot concentrate of studying, child could't learn how to use money for proper things and child can use bad words. If you have child, make them not to play violent games and make them play with friends outside."	5	5	4	14
1838	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" In these days, there are a lot of arguments about effect of doing violent video games. Some people think that there is no effect to do  games, but the others believe oppositely. I support that it can be bad effects for children. In this paper, I will explain why doing violent can affect kids in a negative way for two reasons.
 
 Firstly,  doing violent video games can lead emotion of children to bad way. Kids are too young to classify real world and virtual world perfectly. If they do violent video game too much,  they can learn bad behaviors, and they can practice them in real worlds. Moreover, they can consider violence friendly. Like this, a lot of children can get bad thought by playing violent video games. It is hard to fix emotion and thought that grow from the young age.  In this respect, people who play violent games regulary have more posibility to become a criminal. Like this, it can be critical to children's emotion.
 
 Second of all, violent video games are very addictive. When we do violent video games, a lot of dopamins are relased. Children are easy to addict that kinds of hormones. If they are revealed with dopamins, they don't want to do anything except playing video games. Children should play outside and talk with their friend for healthy growing. However, if they play violence video games, they can't live normal life. Furthermore, they can't concentrate other things. Consequently, they can't learn anything, just games.
 
 To summarize my opinions, I think doing violent video games affect kids in a negative way. It can lead emotion of children bad way. Moreover, it is very addictive. Children learn new things easily. Thus, doing violent video games are more critical for children. They can learn bad things on it, and they can't concentrate anything because of addiction. To grow children rightly, we should have perspective that doing violent games are negative for children. I firmly insist again that doing violent video games are terrible for children.

"   Recently, many people play game in daily life, no matter older people and younger people. News tell us sad stories that some of people who plays game extremly kill other people or their family.

1840	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"        Many people get a funny from the video games, but many games get violent contents and people have effect them. However, there is a social issue that kids can play a violent games. So we argue that violent video games give a bad effect to kids with two main reason on this paper.
        First of all, kids can get mental effect more easily than adults. Kim(Dec.04.2021) argue that his daughter get a mental shock because some people hit him but Kim can't touch her. So her daughter visited mental hospital and doctor diagnosed mental dieases. From this case, we can know that kids' mentals are so weak. Furthermore, Korea Doctors Association (2020) argue that the increasing of the number of kids who visited mental hospital is continued. From this statistic, many kids get a mental disease easily on this world. Therefore, video games affect kids' mental more easily.
        Second, violent games have age restriction. In South Korea, we have 5 age grade(all, 7+, 12+, 15+ 18+).  For example, if someone want play game 'GTA5' that have 18+ age restriction on South Korea, he must prove that he is adult with his cell phone. Although all of country has different grade, they must have game age restriction to protect kids from violence and sexuality etc. This policy can prove the violent game is very harmful to growing kids. Furthermore, new cases of criminal can be occured because of violent games. On 2005, very shocking criminal case is occured on South Korea. One kid who love a shooting game attacked his younger brother with long hammer to re-act the scene on video games. Therefore, violent games can make another social issues.
        In conclusion, we argue that violent video games give a bad effect to kids. There is four reasons, kids' mentals are weak, increasing of the number of kids who visited mental hospital is continued, age restricted policy can prove the violent game is harmful to kids and new cases of criminal can be occured. For that reason. In the future, our world can be combined with online world like 'Metabus' and some of kids couldn't distinguicy real world and online world. So scientist and engineer should develop new security system that check a user's age to kids can't unlock security with his or her parents' cell phone."	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5

Because of this improvement, we can use many IT devices and internet services anywhere and anytime we want. We can enjoy games, video contents, messenger and other things with the IT devices. In current days, smartphone is one of the most spotlighted IT devices in the world. We need just one small smartphone to enjoy all things and share with our family or friends. However, paradoxically, the smartphones have deleted real communication in community.
   First of all, conversation among people are reduced by the smartphones. In the past, which means the days without the smartphones, we can always meet other people and talk with them easily. We can meet and talk with neighborhoods in the elevator of apartment, and any friends we can see at the playground. We can also talk with our family on evening or whole holidays, and go to cinema together or listen to the music at the radio. However, nowadays, we can see lots of contents on OTT applications such as Youtube and Netflix, so we normally enjoy it ourselves in our room without any talk. Also because of the use of SNS such as Instagram or Facebok, we just look for other people's life full of luxury, and that contents make us use more money. The time that we can enjoy alone or overspending wihout advice of family increase argument with family and decrease meeting with friends, so the communication have destroyed by the smartphones.
   In addition, because of the use of smartphones, we don't think about exercise or other physical activities. Without the smartphones, people always enjoyed sports such as soccer and basketball easily with their friends or family. It made our bodies and brains healthy. Also people can talk and communicate with other people while playing sports. In the case of social activites, people needed to go out and meet others to talk about their business or just for chat. It makes our bodies 'move'. However, because of the smartphones, we don't need to move anymore. We can enjoy all sports with game without any communication with others. And we have a meeting with ZOOM or just phone calls, so we can't get a enough communication with people because real meeting with man-to-man is the most effective method for conversation.
   For these reasons, the smartphones reduced a lot of communication and conversation with our family and friends. Also lots of memory that we will enjoy outside are deleted. If we keep going with this method that using the smartphones, we can't go back to good days of past days."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

1846	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"    There are various types of games which has good influence for users. For example, Minecraft is a good educational game for students, so it's used for students in school to learn the java programming. However, some of games which contain violent source makes negative effects to users. Especially, this type of games affects strongly to kids who don't have enough experiences about controling own emotion. Therefore, violent video games affect kids in a negative way. I will suggest 2 reasons why violent games are harmful to kids.

     First, violent games makes kids to do violent behavior. Kids have instinct that doing same behavior what they watch and listen. Therefore, kids want to do same work in real world with what they watch in violent games. For example, the game which name is GTA has violent interection between player and non-player chararcter. They can steal a car, kill anyone with a gun, and hit each other. This type of actions affect kids that they do same behavior. In addition, kids don't know what is worng behavior. If they didn't learn that violent behaviors are wrong from teachers or parents, they can think that that behavior isn't wrong. For example, a kid who stole a car said that he don't know that is wrong. He showed that same behavior in a video game so he thought that that is okay.

    Second, violent games make their mental unhealty. Violent games mainly contain violent and sexual scenes. These scenes are visually and auditory stimulating kids, so they can be easily addicted to it. For example, the kid who played violent games was addicted to them, so the kid couldn't do normal works in school and showed that he has unstable emotion. In addition, violent games causes mental diseases. People who did violent games in childhood can have mental diseases such as ADHD. For example, in cause of ADHD, violent videos and games are one of cause for ADHD. 

    In conclusion, violent games affect kids in a negative way. Violent games can makes kids to do same violent behavior, such as steal a car and fighting with other in real world, because they have instinct that doning same behavior what they watch and listen. In addition, violent games make kids' mental unhealthy, because violent games are one of reason that kids undergo unstablize of emotion and mental diseases. We are adults that can control what we watch and what we experience but kids can't control themselves. Therefore, we have to do works that teach how to do game to healthy way for kids, and suggest a right way for development of games in education as a developer and a programmer for Kids."	5	5	4	14
1847	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"We have heard many issues about violent from kids. For example, a student in china stand up and rush to woman teacher. And shot a punch to her without any reasons. And some students shot a real gun in school. The bad environment they have lived in affect them to bad direction. And violent video game can be one of them, but many good people have been playing, too.  So, I'll tell you that  it's wrong with violent games to affect kids in a negative way.

First ,  Most of kids already know violent games are different with real world. If a kid is baby, it can be dangerous. But if we think about most of kids who can play the game themselves, they can accept it's just a game which can't be real in our world. Usually, most of parents say them that it's not good to play violent games for you. And there are many prevent educations about violent from games in school. When I was elementary school and middle school student, I had heard many educations about that with some real crime news from kids who attack by some violent games. So, if there was a kid who did crime, it would be concerned with the environment which the kid have lived in, and violent games are so little factor of them.


Second, they play violent games to delete thier stress.  In these days, kids are too hard to  live the current world. They have so much assignments and academy schedules. And they can't play freely in playground because of COVID-19. So, it's not good honestly, but it's true that game is the best way to delete their stress. As I mentioned in intro, many good people play violent games like GTA, TAKKEN. And many  people watch video which BJ streamers play GTA. It means that violent game already became famous game in the world, and many kids play that games, too. 


In conclusion, it's hard to say that violent video games affect kids in a negative way. Many kids already know violent games are different with real world and they play violent games for their stress. Of course, there can be some crimes from kids which is about violent game. But it'll be concermed with the environment which they have lived in.

1848	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"Violent Games Can Be Happen in Reality

 Do you like games? Then what games do you usually play? I like FPS games and some are violent games. There are some violent games that shows blood or fighting with other people. I felt that violent video games are very bad for kids.

  First, kids like to copy the action in games. Imagine that they play the fighting game. They will fight for fun to play like game characters. However, sometimes, it can occur real fight. It will make your relationship bad. Plus, they can get hurt. They will try to do the skills that is in the game. It can make their bone broken or  damage in brain. If it is worse,  they will want to se someone's blood. If you play peaceful game like Minecraft, those will not happen. 

 Second, kids can be aggressive. Most of game that we fight with other people have victory-lose system. If they lose many times, it can make them get stressed and aggressive. But, it can't make them to stop play that game. So, it will be stacked. Plus, some kids who like the character will want to be the character. They will do the same thing with the character. If the character is aggressive, kids will be aggressive too. 

 Some can think that violent games can help kids learn how to self protect. In some games, it can be true. However, most of games can't teach self protect. For example, Overwatch can't teach self protect because it can be in reallity. It can only increases their violent personality. Plus, most of kids will play games for fun not for self protect. It is hard to remember what map did I played last game because I forget all of them. Kids will do too. They don't need memory for last game, only now.

 To sum up, playing violent video games can make kids a bad way. They can get bad relationship, get hurt or be aggressive. It will happen more in kids because they lack self-control. They have to wait until they have enough self-control. If you have your cousin or younger brother or sister playing violent video games, for you and he or her future, why don't you tell to stop and play a peaceful game with them? "	4.5	4	3.5	12
1849	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"    Today, there is a debate about a topic 'Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way?'. Some people say that violent games are harmful for kids, while others say that it is not harmful. This paper argues that violent video games affect kids in a negative way for 3 reasons.

    First, kids can repeat behavior presented in a video game in reality. Because kids have undeveloped ability to judge, they can do things in the funny video game although they are violence.  So if they got used to violence in a game,  they also get used to violence in a reality. For example, they can beat other childrens' head  and say a name of offensive skill. 

    Second, wild images in the game affects kids mind in a negative way. Blood or deads are new experiences to growing kids and they can give mental shocks. They are far from reality, but childrens who playing violence games can recognize that they are common in the reality. For example, they can think stealing other's car is fine or using knifes to kill people is nice.

    Finally, kids can be addictive on a violence video game. It is not limited to violence video game, and kids can be addictive in any game. That fact is bad enough. But violence video game is more dangerous for reasons above. They can not separate a game and reality, and use violence in reality.

    In conclusion, violence video games affect kids in a negative way for these reasons. Kids can repeat behavior presented in a video game. Wild images in the game affects kids mind negatively. Kids can be addictive on a game. If you are parents, educate childrens who playing violence video games good values and difference between a game and reality. Then childrens are fine though they play it."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1850	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"this game fight with weapons to kill each other. Surprisingly, most of the players of the game was kids, whose age were around 10-15. In my experience, almost everyone of my calss  played Sudden Attack. However, playing violent video games like this could change kids' characteristics and result in peer bothering.


Children who play a violent video games a lot could take violence and slang granted, and this causes peer bothering in School. Do you know almost every slang kids use is from Violent video games? 8per 10 friends I met in elementary school learn a lot of slang after starting video game. Even though childhood is the time when children start seeking what they like and get self-esteem,  a lot of children just use this time for playing violent games, which would influence the characteristic they get. On the other hand, these days many peer-bothering  are caused by  violent video games. Kids who play that games imitate the play in real world, actually in school. It somtimes lead to serious school violence issues.

We need to control two things about video game, and the best place for controling video games and educating about them is elementary and middle school.  First, we have to encourage better activities than playing violent video games. For example, teachers encourage activities include enjoying sports and music. kids had better enjoy not only video games but also various activities. 

In conclusion, I insist that video game influence kids in negative way because playing violent early can influence characteristic and peer bothering in school.
Education and controling for video game is needed for children's good self-seeking activiteis. The kids who get good education about video game would grow up to be a nice adult, and when they become adult, they would play violent video game in positive way. "	3	2.5	3	8.5
1851	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" My parent didn't bought me smartphone because they thought it is not helpful for studying. And because of this I was able to commuicate for much time with my family and friends. Like my case, smartphone usually destroy communication among people. I will show three reasons and details about it.
 First of all, using smartphone takes too much time. When we want to be closer with someone, we need to spend much time with them. It will be same with family and friends. However, smartphone takes that time because it has many interesting contents. This will lead to lack of time to spend together and chance to make good memories.  So, communication will be reduced by lack of reletionship. 
 Second, it is too easy to communicate by using smartphone. Messingers or SNS are one of the most important part of smartphone. Most of people think there are only advantages like easy to use or doesn't need much time. However this advantages can give some bad effects to us. Have you ever seen phonecall phobia in news? I was very surprised when I saw that word. Many young people are having that phobia because they always use messingers to communicate with someone. Like this, too much using smartphone for communicate is bad for good communication. 
 Lastly, using smartphone can distribute our emotional ability. It is easy to meet very bad contents in smartphone. Their mind can be hurt when people watch then too much. It means their real lifes get effects by contents they watched. In addition, their social skills will be come worse because of using smartphone. Because using smartphone is one-side-communication. They don't need to see other people's face or behavier. Like these, smartphone make people hard to think about other people's emotion well in real world.  
 I have talked about three main idea that why the smartphone is bad for communication. To sum up, communicate with people face to face is the most important one. I hope that people commincate well and spend good time with their friends and family,"	4	4	3	11
1852	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"    Most of adults say “When I was young” if they see kids do something bad. Most of such kids think the adults was same with them after they listen such phrase. However, it is really different from past kids and present kids: there are games in present. When our kids play the games, which most of them are violent, gets bad effects from them because kids are not adults, so they can get the effects easily compared with adults. Now this paper argues violent video games have negatvie interaction with kids.
    Most of all, violent video games affect to our characteristics. Because games are very stimulated elements, it is easy to affect our kids’ mind, and mind can change the characteristics. For example, when we play such game, we can steel someone’s product by using violence. If our kids think it is similar in real world, they will be cruel human. Also, it is bad to grow patience. Because the games are easy to get output very fast, kids who play such game a lot is difficult to wait.
    Second, violent video games disturb children’s concentration. Sight images are remembered very easily, and sometimes we usually experience that we suddenly remind those images. Games also give the sight images because it stimulate our neuron; if games are combined with violence, its image will be more powerful. It means after playing violent game, the number of that remind is increasing, so our kids can’t concerntrate well. Also, it connects to the lack of patience which is wrriten at the above pargraph. The kids who decrease their patience by the game can’t concentrate well because concentrate is opposite position of immediate output. They can’t do something for a long time: because games make them that.
    Finally, violent video games can make child to neglect violent in real world. Most of games make to underestimate the danger of violent: For example, when we are shut by gun in games, not only we die one time, but we walk and even run. However, in real world, we can die if we are shut not fatal parts such as head or heart: games exaggerate endurance of human’s body and kids will believe this is true. Moreover, when we die in games, we can revive only wait a second. It makes kids think death is not serious: because they will revive after a second.
    In concluison, when kids play violents games, they get negative effects in several ways. First, their characteristics changes; violence changes them to be crucial. Second, their concentration system is destoryed; game makes they can’t wait. Lastly, their standard of violence will increase; they will overestimate the standard of violence. So, For these reasons, violent video games affects kids in a negative way: our kids should be protected by this bad effects."	5	5	4	14
1853	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Nowadays, many people watch some movies and TV. It has various topic like action, horror, documentary, ... etc. So, How do movies or TV influence people's behavior? I think 3 thing about this question.
 First of all, News can influence many people's behavior. News give much information in world. So people can know about new thing and sometimes defend accident. For example, when COVID19 started, news reported it and how to defend it. News made many people to wear a mask and not to meet many people.
 Next, advertisements make people to buy something. Almost of TV programs and movies have ads, so people must watch it and someone will buy something. Company can earn money to this ads and people can buy something to this ads.
 Lastly, movies or TV can change people's mind. All of movies and TV programs have topic and messange for audience. For example, the documentary which is about protecting animals can change people to love animals. Or some movies for just fun makes people to laugh and make positive. I think people's mind is changing, people's behavior is also changing.
 To sum up, I think news, advertisement and any movies or TV program change people's mind and behavior. All of this have some messages to tell something. Thanks for reading my essay!"	3	3	3	9
1854	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Movies and TV make people's behavior violent. 
 First, many movies and TV programs have violent scenes. For example, we can see many 19 dramas in Netflix like Nano and kingdom. These dramas have so much violent scenes like murder or war scene.
Don't matter we want to see these violent scenes, we will must see violent scene if we want to enjoy any video program. Even though funny TV program has also violent scene hitting other person to fun.
When we repeat to see these violent things, we will be influenced by them. Sometimes we will thing that the violent scene is not strang also in the real world . 
If there are simmilar situation with the scene in realistic, we would maybe behave rude and violent, because we could think that is usual.
 Second, people would try what the characters do in movies or TV. People want to behave simmilar with the person who they like and respect, even though the person is just a character in a movie.
Many people will have a experience they tried same thing with the main character in a popular TV drama. 2 years ago, when drama ""Itewon class"" was popualr, many boys had the same hair stlye with actor Sejun Park.
This is not different with violent character. If a violent character looks so good in a movie or TV program, people will want to behave same with him even they know that behavior is not right.
 By these reasons, movies and TV influence people so much and they may behave violent after watching more and more movies or TV programs."	3	3	2.5	8.5
1855	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are many kinds of entertainments or hobbys that people enjoy in their free time. And the kind of video information like movies or TV program are the most popular thing that people enjoy. This means many of people spend their time by watching these kind of videos and videos influence their usual life easily. Now a days, youtube is the most famous and popular flatform for sharing and watching videos online. And the youtuber who has many subscriber is considered as famous star. The kind of video like movies, TV programs or youtube video form a culture of social community. And it differ to region, men or women and age. The flow of video information form culture of community and react with people's behavior. 
For example, 'mukbang', food eating video, is the kind of famous concept of video recently. Many of TV program and youtube video contains food information and eating video and these videos are popular regardless of region, sex and age. Some of people want to go to the restaurant where they have seen in TV program and they recommend it to other people to go. This is the example that video contents influence people's eating culture. 
The other example is video can change people's speaking culture. There are a lots of video for fun and some of them contains new words or kind of sentence that is called as 'meme'. When the meme become very popular, many people use it when speaking in their ordinary life with others and some TV programs begin to use it in their programs to not to lose people's interest. We can easily realize the speaking culture change by surfing the internet and comparing with TV program of 10 years ago and that of recently made. 
But there is also speaking culture diffrence with age. Because of difference of video watching habit between young and old people, the speaking culture of young and old people are very diffrent and even older people cannot understand younger poeple's speaking. It is obvious that interest for young and old are very different. And this result in speaking culture change differently by age. "	2.5	2	2.5	7
1856	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"   By the evolution of the electricity, many people usually enjoy watching movies and TV. Therefore, some experts concerns about TV and movies influence people's behavior. I agree with that idea. There are some reasons to support my idea.

   First, TV shows news to us. Even though many people read news by smartphone, elder still watch TV to read news. For example, 8'O clock news, 9'O clock news, and emergency news. This can lead elder to get oneside thinking. We read news from many types of company, but elder uses only KBS, MBC, and SBS. Thus, news can manipulate their mind easily by giving wrong news. I think that this reason is main factor of why elder and MZ generation fight each other.

   In addition, TV and movies can make fantastic image  to some jobs. For instance, I watched many Korean drama when I was young. After watching drama Good Doctor, I want to be a doctor since the drama show me cool sins like saving people by operating, getting lots of money. However, the drama never shows me bad sins that some doctors kill their patients by wrong operation or amount of studying to become doctors. Another case, after watching drama Descendent of Sun, I want to be a soldier. The drama show me sins that saving people from terror, kill bad person by gun. In the other hand, soldier can die easily because they use gun at other countries. Like this, the person or job which got bad image can change their image better by using TV and movies.
   
   In conclusion, TV or movies influence people's behavior and mind. They show wrong news or particular news, make fantastic image for some jobs. If you do not want to be manipulated your mind, you have to get diverse informations by reading or watching.  "	4	3.5	3.5	11

 Other way that movies or TV influence people's behavior is TV or movies show people influencer's behavior and daily life like clothes and it make new trends at society.

Many TV shows like GET IT Beauty, in Korea TV program, show people how to use draw face shape and what product is the most in similiar products.

I thinks that BTS, the most famous K-pop artist, is great example in tinfluence people's behatviorhat case. I think videos 


First of all, Movies and TV Program are combined the society. 
Producer who make movies and his or her co-worker should analyse about what is popular and funny in people's mind. So people get fun from that movies,
Second, video can give more stimulation than other material.
More than 60 years ago, the only device that can get informations in korea is radio. radio sends sound and people hear that. In this case, people only use thier ears. However, In this time, videos are main tools that spread informations. During COVID-19 pandemic, video flatform such as youtube, Netflix and wavve etc can fastest grow and we see a movie in that flatform. This fact give some idea that Movies and TV program can create cultural power for people, too.
Last reason, popular makes wave in culture.
Anyone can make culture wave for thier own's benefit. If people don't like specific culture, culture is destroy in that time. We already know great example in China. China goverment still tried to chinese culture spread in many country like K-pop, but they get failure.

1859	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"We can see influence people in movie or TV. They are so beautiful, cool, or fun. But many people wonder their behavior in real life because they wonder that behavior in TV and behavior in real life are same. I think movies or TV influence people's behavior should be careful because of their attetion. I will tell you why they do that with 2 reasons.

First, influence people are popular, so their behavior can cause any problems. Their personal thinking or talking can be target of arrow or reason for some poeple's behavior. For example, when Dokyo Olympics there are  pesing team game that korea versus germany. While playing game, korean player fall down due to attack, so germany player tell hoster he should get yellow card and replayed his moving. But, Korean caster saw his moving, he thought germany player is kidding korean player.  So, he told it is wrong behavior in TV. When this game is ended, the germany player got a lot of message from korean fan that include trash talking. Caster's wrong talking cause this problem. 

Second, influence people can work by attention. To work in TV or any flatform, influence people should get attention. If their behavior is bad and it is known, they can't work in TV. For example, there are famous MC jaeseok Yu in korea. His talking skill and sense is so good, but his behavior is also good. He always dominate with a lot of money, and he helps his close people. So, his behavior is so famous and he is loved by many people because of his mind and behaviors. However there are many influence people who have bad behavior. Nowadays, influence people's school violence is hot. They were famous actor, singer, and sports player. But after their behavior is known,  they should cancel their TV program and they can't wear uniforms. 

I told you why influence people's behavior should be more careful than other people. Normal people's behavior is not attented because it's not interesting. But influence people's real life style is so interesting topic for normal people. If their bad behavior is known, they could lose their job. Also, their behavior and tlaking can cause any problems because they are famous. Their personal thinking or talking can be target of arrow because they are famous people. Therefore, they should behave more careful, careful and careful to work for a long time and get attention by people. It is so cruel thing for influence people, but I think it is part of their work.

Usually most of person have a habbit to watch TV or phone drama. As a result, they have many times with famous TV of movies and naturally imitate their habiit or behavior in life.
Second, when we meet another person like friend or companion of company topic of conversation is often to famous TV show or movies recently released.
because of  that, it is easy to remind the TV program and movies through talk of other people`s say even if you don`t watch the TV or phone drama.
If we get used to this talk about movies or TV, unconciously behavior in movies come in to our subconcious mind. because of this mind we do some behavior like character of movies when we don't percive what we are doning  that time.
Finally, TV or movies is featured a lot of famous person such as actor, actress, singer and dancer. people sometimes  think that ""I really want to be a that influenser "". Then if you have some famouse influenser that you like usually naturally you imitate the the person's behaviors or talk habbits.
what I want to talk about is that people are easy to be affacted by movies or TV show and their character and they imitate influenser's behavior naturally."	2.5	2	2.5	7

Thanks to this movie, I have had dream that is to go space. Like me, I think almost people watched many movies, and they are affected by movies and TV. How do movies or TV affect people?
 First, I think movies or TV help people decide their future. We can see lions that live in Africa or famous people who live in other countries at our home through TV or movies. Like this, movies and TV serve various experiences. These expeeriences make us get interested in various works. In the result, we can have a dream like my case.
 In addition, TV give us various news almost simultaneously when events happen. For example, we can get news that far country is damaged by storm, so we can donate for them. People bring their umberlla because they saw the wheater cast that said ""It will be rain in evening"". TV serve many news related with us and make us behave.
 Unfortunately, TV or movies sometimes influence people in the bad way. Many teenagers mimic violences that are the movie scenes. People often see the violent scene through TV or movies, they could be not to cionsider the violences seriously.
 To sum up, I think TV or movies influence people in various ways. They sometimes help people decide their future and serve various events around the world. But they could work in bad ways, they could justify violence and make people mimic the violent scenes. "	3.5	3	3	9.5

Many babys don't know about common behavior, so they are easy to affect from the characters from TV.
Second, the way how do movies and TV influence student's behavior. In school, students are often talking about the TV program or movie. Because they are students, they don't care about business kinds of thing yet. So their subject of chatting is should be some entertational things like the actor in the movie or the charactor in the TV animation. In that mood, students are naturaly affected by movies and TV.
Lastly, the way how do movies and TV influence bussiness man's, who is working, behavior. They are not students, and they usally work for many times in their life.

1864	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"    We can find various genre of movies in this day, especially some kinds of genre influence people's behavior strongly. In Korea, the movie 'Tajja' has influenced our words and reactions in common conversations. Because lots of actors and youtubers use the one of scene in the movie as 'Meme', common people also use this epressions in common situations. Like this way, many people's behavior are influenced by TV program and movies. We can find more way about this situation.

    FIrst, movies or TV uses makes specific word or sound that addict us. For example, in Korea's TV program 'Comedy Big League', comedians makes audiences laughing to use special sentences and acts. When we watch this program at home or public spaces, we use it to other people to make feel frendly. And we can talk more about this, so we easily use this expressions at common conversations.

    Second, some meaningful movies or TV programs give us a new information. For example, Korean movie 'Brother' is talking about life of disabled peoples by accident. In this movie, we can feel how they live hard in this moment and how we help them to live more easily by themselves. Also, I can learn about those by this movie. So, these kinds of movies or TV programs can affect people to do right works.

     Lastly, It's different with other two reasons, Some of movies and TV programs which talk about bad works influence people's behavior to wrong way. There was one movie in US which was talking about awful crimes in the US. Contents of this movies was based on real crimes so it was almost like a documentary. It had a recommendations by famous writers but, after that similar crimes appeared. Some people uses same way with movies to make crimes.


    TV programs and movies influence people's behavior to good way and bad way. We can't touch about what TV or movies directors makes, but I think they should efforts to make a good influences to people by their works. When we watch a good movie, we can make more good society I think."	3.5	3	3	9.5
1865	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"We can see many people who learn some behaviors or joking from movie and TV. It can be very useful for society. Because everyone know a specific behavior from famous TV or movies. So, it's good to express and understand fastly and easily. But sometimes, it give bad effects to children. Children can deserve some languages, behaviors very easily without decision of it's effect for other people. So, we have seen many bad examples of that such as shooting real gun. So, I wanna say that how do movies or TV influence people's behavior. I think there are two main reasons about that.

First, people can remember sensitive things easily. It means that if some behaviors or saying  give us stronf feeling about that scene, we naturally think that behaviors or saying when we are in same situation. So, it's important that how much the scene is similar with real world. For example, people follow the method of expressing love to person from some famous romantic movies. Because people were impressed by the method of expressing love which they haven't seen before or very romantic to him/her.But some kids don't matter the real world. They just follow many behaviors which can be dangerous.  So, there are district by the age in TV or movie.

Second,  when we got a message from the movie or TV, our behavior could be different with original us. Of course, it is similar with first reason, but this reason is more heavier than first thing. It's like that if a movie give some important valueable of life to us "	2	2	2.5	6.5
1866	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Do you think movies or TV can influence people's behavior? My answer is ""YES"". I want to start with telling my experience about it. First, I don't like watching movies and TV nowdays. However, my 13 years old cousin likes to watch TV. He always watches TV when he is in home. I realized how TV make my cousin to go wrong way. I'll talk about it.

 First, it make people addicted. I agree this very much. When I was young, I didn't watch TV. I liked to play with my friends and make robots. However, after I started to watch TV. I noticed that TV is much funnier than playing with my friends, making robots and resfing books. TV makes  me sit at sofa and watch TV almost of time. The interesting thing is, my cousin is doing same thing when i was addicted to TV. He is getting worse. When I was his age, I go to math academy and taekwondo academy. However, he is at home everyday and only watches TV. I was very sad when I see that.

 Second, it makes people agressive. I think this is the most opinion when we discuss about this topic. Action movies or fighting scene in TV animation make people more agressive. Someone who watches action movies like to  simulate same thing in real life. It can make someone hurt or if it is so though,  someone can die. 

 Lastly, movies or TV not always make people's behavior worse. Some movies give some lesson,  some TV programs talk about attitude. I had a lesson from some movie. I don't watch movie but watch review. The movie <Terminal> gives me lesson that we can do any thing if we have passion to it. So, I tried to do that I wanted to do whether it success or fail. 

 To sum up, movies or TV influence people's behavior. It can influence good way or bad way. It needs controll not to go bad way. Thank you for reading!"	3	3	3	9
1867	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think that movies and TV influence people's behavior like these ways.

First, people want to get fashion items owned by celebrities. Because they look like awesome and happy in movies and TV.
Not only fashion items, also plastic sergery get popularity beacause of lookism. Why lookism is occured by movies and TV?
I think people who are pretty or handsome have more ticket power. So we watch more awesome people, feel good, recognize that people love 'handsome man'.
Also ad of TV influence people's way buying goods. More exposed to us, more we feel close, purchase them. 

Second, TV gives information to us. 
For example, In cooking program, chef makes delicious food and reveal his recipe. we can cook like him after watching TV.
TV news also report incident event of everyday. we can recognize dangerous crime, weather of tomorrow,  changed social laws,  and so on.
So  we change our behavior to avoid night way, go out with umbrella, do not meet 4 over people.
Even news can make mind of crowd through one sided news to make people vote the candidate.


Last, TV and movies can control people's emotion.
People who watching sad movie can cry and donate to young children,
who watching funny  show can laugh and be a fan of MC.
who watching annoying news can stand with picket.

Like these ways, TV or movies influence people's behavior."	3	1	1.5	5.5
1868	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think the age when people  watch Tv or movie  influences the result of watching so I  group people on 4 types.
1. baby(2~7)
2. child(8~13)
3. adolescent(14~19)
4. adult
I think which contents baby watches and how many times baby watches contents influence baby's character type and contents influece hobby and interest ofchild and adolescent, and lastly contents let adult relieve from other stresses.
First, the genre of movie build baby's basic character. For example, babies who watch movie of hero a lot will dream to be  people who can save other people and babies who watch movie about awesome machine or lego will be inerested in drawing schema of machine and dream to be scientests. I find out this fact by experience! I mean, I have seen friends since  I was baby and almost every baby friends get hobby and interest related with their favorite movie and TV show. Also I think If babies watch Tv a lot , then they could be used to just watching not expressing their thoght. 
Secondly, type of contents chidren watch can influence their interest and what they are doing in school. For example, children who like Tv program about animals or dinosours  are interested in raising animal and they will be interested in biology study in school.. And if children. And children who like hero movies are inetersted in saving other people, so they hang out with many friends in school, like playing sports together or do something together after school. 
Thirdly, I think adolescent can learn a lot from Tv or movie. For example, they can learn awesome words or fashion style from movie and use those at school. Maybe they can wearing like their famous actor. Also,in adolescent they wear similar with their friends. so Tv and movie could make famous style along adolescent.
Finally, I think adult watch Tv and movie for their relax in leisure time. These contents can relieve them from stresses from work or other problem. And  also I think these contents influences fashion style  they are interested in."	3.5	2.5	3	9
1869	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"For many different ways, media - such as movies or TV- influence people’s behavior.
First, they make some ‘ideal’ structure of people and put the image to general people. For example, although most people are not thin or skinny in the real world, most of people who are shown by movies or TV look like having nice body. However, they are not standard and even they are not working(it means the period that they don’t have to take drama or movie), their body shape come back to “general”. However, many people want to have body like them, and this make people hurt themselves. Through the image of “beauty” being put by media to us, we go to gym or to do plastic surgery. It is the case of changing our view by media.
Second, sometimes they give their ideas to us directly. For example, in the past, Korea are colonized by Japan Empire, and August 15th is independence day of Korea. So about that time, there are many documentaries or movies which says “we shoudn’t forget the history”. When we watch these, we are put the idea of people who make these contents. Similarly, many Korean movie shows the  equation: Republican = villian. It can make Republican politicians’ image worse and even they argued to directors. If the media doesn’t have the power to control people, they didn’t argue it.
Finally, they flow their ideas ‘naturally’ in the contents. For the most popular one of these, it is PPL. PPL means indirect advertisements. Let’s think about the famous TV drama. After the drama finished, SNS are hot to find the item worn, put, even eaten by the actor.  If movies shows some region looks very beautiful, people used to go there and put there photos to SNS with lots of hashtag(#). And when we shows eating delicious food(fried chicken, pizza, hamburger, ect…) on TV, we naturally want to eat it and even deliver it though we don’t plan to use money to eat it. Why? That’s the power of PPL. Never the company says “Buy this one please”. They just show and charm people. 
If the media can’t change people, many companies don’t use the money to advertise.  We know if  a company wants to advertise something at TV, they needs a huge amount of money to do that. And we know all companys are not charity. their first goal is making money. So we could know the media can control the people."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1870	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	" Have you attended school or university? If then, is the school or university is in your home country? Nowadays some students attend schools or universities out their home countries. In my opinion, students often study abroad to get better education and to work at that country.
 First, most students who study abroad might want to get better education. In case of engineering, people think MIT, CalTech are the best university in the world. Therefore, students who do not live in U.S.A and if their ability is great so they want to get best education, they will choose to go to MIT, Caltech even it is not in their home country. Similar with this example, in every section in study, there should be best schools or universities and if it is not in student's home country, they might study abroad.
 Second, maybe working environment is good at that country. When you are attending to a university, you will get a chance to work as intern in the lab or near factory which want students of that university. If students think work environment of the lab or that factory, they might go to that university to get a good job.
 To sum up, students want to get suitable education and a job so they often study abroad. It is not a bad choice to study abroad if you can get some advantages. However it is also not a best chioce becuase you can achieve what you want even attend to school or university in your home country. Therefore, you should consider enough before you decide to study abroad."	3	4	2.5	9.5
1871	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"The way for increasing your global intelligence : studing abroad.

 My father always says, ""Doing is better than watching."" He want to say expierecing realworld is better than studing textbook. Like this, real-world exp. The students go abroad for broading their expierence and career.

 First, Going abroad makes themselve global. Expiereces about language is unique. However, the oversea expiereces gives real-world expierence and prove their language abilities. So they can be global.

 Next, Studing in other countries is helpful for maiking their unique social web. Thesedays, getting a nice work is not easy. So many people signs in social network servicies like LinkedIn, because imployer  want to see their career page. Like these context,  studing in other countries can make new offline relationships. It increases social information and getting-work probablity. It means a unique social web is important for career. 

 To summerize, students can get new expierence and carrer through going overseas. As I mentioned, it gives wider information and relationships. It makes them work on better environmets. So If you get a chance to go abroad, try it. It will make you global person having language abilities and own unique social web."	3.5	3.5	2.5	9.5
1872	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"    If you can choose a school for your study, what school would you like to choose? Students tend to seek schools or universities which have a global influence. In this perspective, it is good for students to study abroad for two reasons.
    First, students can share various ideas originated from different cultures. Of course, difference of culture creates difference of perspective or idea. When those ideas come together, they can get more creative ideas contrast to ideas from students in the same country. Besides, that wider perspective helps for students to deal with global problems. For example, global warming cannot be dealt without the support from whole countries around the world.
    In addition to gathering thoughts between countries, students also grow their English skills. Nowadays, people use English as the global language. When they go abroad to study, they also use English to share ideas. Thus, they learn how to claim their opinion effectively in English. Advanced English skills will help them to encourage people to do some actions well as needed.
    In brief, enrolling to foreign schools encourages students to create new ideas and be prepared for English speaking. Only global universities can make a change for the better world."	4	4.5	4	12.5
1873	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	" Studying aborad
     Where do you want to go if you have chance to study abroad? Many people want to attend schools and universities in abroad instead their home countries. There are two reasons why people wants to study abroad.
     First, people can experience more than in their home countries. In some department, some countries would have more developed technology and information than their home countries. For example, Germany is well known as new and renewable energy than any other countries and there are more processing studies and researches than Korea. Like this case, people can do deeper and more specific study in abroad. Also, they can experience other culture. People have their own stereotypes about other cultures, countries or other things. When they go and study in other countries, however, they will be able to learn and understand various sights. It will make students have wide sights about society. 
     Second, people who studyed abroad has more possibility of getting higher and wider social  position. Most leaders want to hire poeople who experienced and learned  more. Studying abroad can be a big advantages in this aspect. People who studyed abroad  are more likely to get higher position in society than those who did not. People in higher position can earn more money and the quality of life could change either. Also, people who studyed in other countries can have more  choice. Some people have no choice in getting their jobs or other things. However, people studyed abroad can choose various way like being a company man, studying in a lab of other countries and so on. 
     It is clear that studying in other countries instead of attending their home countries can make people have various experiences and get more possibility to success in society. If you  hesitate about attending schools in abroad, I recommend you to go there because it will make you a bigger person. "	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5
1874	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"  What do you think the best part of going abroad for school/university is? Studying in foreign countries is dream of many students. Why do they want to go abroad? I think students want to study abroad because they can learn the country's language or culture efficiently and find more chances in larger countries. 
  First, students can learn different language, culture well by studying and interacting with natives. For example, to learn english efficiently, many Korean students decide to attend schools in english-using countries. As listening lectures in English and talking with native speakers frequently enhance own's Language skills, many students who want to use English well goes abroad. Additionally, the culture may be different. For some students who like experiencing other cultures, this can be an another huge reason to applying universities/schools in foreign countries. 
  Second, students can find more chances in foreign countries. Sometimes, there are way more chances in foreign countries if the students' home countries are less developed in education than the countries of universities/schools. For example, Imagine that a Korean student wants to study specific nano surface but associated studies are not active in Korea. Then this student may decide to attend university in USA where the study has been practiced actively. As the country is way bigger than Korea and way more people, there are  more things to select. The student may also be able to  have jobs related with the nano surface in USA because there are more demand than in Korea. Like this, there are more chances to get if you go abroad. 
  To sum up, I think students want to go abroad because they can improve 2nd language skills and experience culture, and get various chances. If you want to learn 2nd language well, how about studying abroad? "	4.5	4	4	12.5
1875	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"Why some companies want to know information about ? They want to know the language ability. Studying another country's language is hard. The best way for that is living in that country. So many people thinks that is the reason about studying abroad. However, the students choose that for different reasons.
The biggest reason that they want to study about another country's culture and language. In my opinion,  studying language is the  biggest reason. In their own country, it is hard to learn another country's language. In another country, they live in the country people. Through this time, students can make their language ability better and feel the country's culture directly. 
Some students have another reason. When their family work for another country, the students move together. My friend's life is that case. His father works in Germany, and his family moves to Germany and he graduated the german highschool. He would attend German university also. He did not have any purpose, he choose to study abroad. 
Students study abroad for their own reason. Some students want to make their language ability better than before, some students have no purpose for studying abroad. I cannot say which is better.  However, it makes students knowledge more widely. Students can experience many things that is not in their homecountry. Therefore, they can think and do in many ways. Students have many reasons to attend schools outside, the goal is ultimately similar."	3	3	2.5	8.5
1876	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"In Korea, you can see many students study english more than other subject because they have dream to study abroad. Also many parents want their son or dauther to study abroad. They want to go to USA, Europe and Canada etc for study. There are some reasons that they prefer study abroad.  There are many famous university, professor, lab than their home country.  Also most foreign university use english. So they can progress their
english ability. I think that study abroad gives good effects to student. Let me explain the main reasons and supporting ideas.
First, students can progress their english or other language ability. That is very important point. In their home country, they can progess their english or other language to study hard. But this method have a restriction. Students don't use foreign language in their daily life often. The best way to progees foreign language skill is using foreign language often in their daily life. If some students go to study abroad, they must use foreign language in their daily life. They buy their food, cloths and ride bus or taxi in daily life. So If they use foreign language in daily life, their skill progress faster than not use in daily life.  Also, they see their lecture with foreign language. This is hard process. If you want to understand lecture information exactly, you should translate foreign language and understand it. That process is hard. But if you do this process continue,  your foreing language skill must progess.
Second, students can experience famous school, university, and foreign culture early. Many famous school and university located in USA, and Europe. So if students go to study abroad early, they can experience good study environment than other people. Also, they can experience good university lab. It helps for student who don't decide their major or goal. If some students want to work global companies or foreign companies, experience that study abroad will give positive effect. Because students who already experience their daily life in foreign country already know foreign culture. So they can work global companies better. They know foreign life style, mind, and humors. 
In conclusion, I think studying abroad have many positive effect and students who want to experience foreign school, life should go foreign early. If they go foreign early, they have more time to live in foreign country. So they can progess their foreign language skill faster and experience foreign culture. I know that there are bad effects of study abroad. They miss thier home country, and they feel alone easily. But I think positive effect will cover that negative effect. So, In my opinion, go to foreign country early to study abroad gives lots of benefits than negative effects. If you or your son/daughter want to go foreign country to study, I recommend go to early as possible as you can, and adapt foreing culture. It will give you a lot of benefits."	5	4.5	3	12.5
1877	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"   What do you feel when you travel to the other country? Do you feel fascinating or calm? Every person will have own feeling. However, many people will feel that they want to live in the country. Hence, I think that students also want to study outside their home countries for several reasons.
     First of all, they can experience many things. Every country has different culture. For example, Korea has a culture which is called, ""Ddaechang"". In a concert, Koreans usually sing songs with musicians. It makes concert more exciting. However, in Japan, people just hear the musician's songs. They have their own advantages. We can experience these cultural differences, so our cultural understading skill will be increased.
     Second, the student may like other country's studying style. In Korea, many students study really hard. Hence, almost of student went to academy. It is hard, but we can learn more deeply. However, I heard that other country does not. They rarely do a home-schooling. It has advantages which is free, and easy to balance what they want to learn. I think that if a student goes to other country, then he(she) may like that country's study style.
     In conclusion, many student wants to study abroad, not in their home country. The reason will be that they can experience many thing in other country to increase their cultural understading skill. Also, they want to study like other country's study style. Living in same country for over 10 years would be bored. If you are bored at your country's surroundings, then study abroad."	4.5	5	3.5	13

1879	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"These days, students not only live in their home countries to study or work, but also live outside their home countries to do their own work like study or research. The reason why they go abroad is that if they go to different countries, they can experience specialistic experiments without doing it in their country. So, let's talk about that students go abroad with 2 reasons.
First, there are many things to study or research in different countries. I can tell you an example about Korea. IT like AI or BIGDATA has lots of work with English than Korean, students go to different countries to study or research well these things.
Second, students can feel lifestyles of abroad countries. Student can experience special and unique experiments to feel lifestyles of abroad countries without feeling in their home country. In addition, when they sell things to abroad countries, they can do easy and calm lifestyles of abroad countries. 
To sum up, students can study or research things in abroad countries not to do in their home country, that they go to abroad can help their jobs to feel lifestyles of abroad countries. Therefore, I think students study abroad."	2.5	3	2	7.5
1880	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"The saying ""Education is the future"" shows studying is the best way to achieve our dreams. Today, a lot of students are studying to do, and they are studying to go aboard, too. Going aboard give us diverse benefits cannot earn in only our countries. So, many students choose to attend universities in other countries. Then, I will explain why they go there with three reasons.
First reason is existing differences of well developed technology each country. All countries have other surroundings, so they have differences profession about each subject. If my country has not well developed technology that I want to study about, I will have to find other ways including in going aboard. Being able to go aboard to study gives us diverse choices we choose detailed subjects with universities.
Second reason is meeting foreigners can be friends. We can make friends in schools and universities. In similary, we can make friends not same home countries in foreign, because you can meet and live with foreign friends. Maybe it will be help that you meet diverse people.
Finally, we can earn informations easily about aboard companys than just staying home countries. If you graduate your universities, you will have to determine what to do. You can be profession, but going company, too. In universities, you can find informations about company. It is equal to be able to earn informations in foreign universities. Also, if you want to enter foreign companys, you will go aboard with attending universities in there.

If you are interested in above benefits, you must consider going foreign unversities to be well. "	3	4	3	10
1881	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	" These days, globalization become a huge flow of our lives. We watch hollywood movies, listen billborad chart songs, and study books from USA. In addition, many students go to other countries to attend schools or universities. So, I'll talk about the reason why do some students study abroad. 
     First, you can learn more advanced knowledges and technologies than home country. Some KAIST students go to USA to get a doctor graduation, because American university's doctor grade is generally better than Korean university's doctor grade to be a professor. We can see American technology is the best that Hyundai bought Boston dyanmics which is one of the best Robotics Center.
     Second, you can broaden your sight of view. If you meet people from various countries and communicate with them, you'll understand how they think in normal life and solve specific problems. In example, most Koreans are passionate and study hard to achieve goals, but foreign people use their time for healing more than Koreans. These experiences can change your mind or stance.
     To sum up, many students go to other countries to study for two big reasons. However, study aborad is not always a great choice. Different language or their own cultures can suffer your study. The most important thing is focus and concentrate to your study, without where "	4	3.5	3.5	11
1882	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"Today, global society has been connected, so it is not difficult at all to go other countries or communicate with foreign people lived in other countries. A lot of people go outside their home countries for various reasons such as traveling, buisness meeting, or studying abroad. Among them, it is not an easy decision to attend schools or universities outside their home countries.
There are several reasons some students study abroad.
First, they can improve their English skills. Almost every school which have many foreign students use English, so they should use English to communicate with others. Although they are not good at English at first time, their English skills, especially speaking and listening, is rapidly improved while they always use English in their daily life. For example, there are some parents who wants their children to attend foreign countries' school to make their English skills better. This is because people who has lived in foreign countries once usually speaks English fluently.
Second, there are many university which has high level of education. Some talented students needs higher level of education because they don't satisfy with education of home country's university. For example, students who are talented in Math and Science often go to foreign country's university such as MIT to study what they want with some students who are also talented in it.
Finally, They can make a lot of experience at foriegn countries. They can understand other countries' culture while they talk with them. In addition, they can adopt global society easier because they already have lived in other countries. This experience might broaden their sight to observe some society problems.
To sum up, some students study aborad to improve their English skills, get high level of education, and make a lot of expereince at there. The advantages of studying aborad is more than these things, so I recommend to try to study abroad if you can. The experience you study aborad will helps you forever."	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5
1883	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	" Do you want to attend universities to abroad? In my case, I really want to go to abroad and study computer science at there. Many of my friends also want to study at abroad, so I talked them about why we should go abroad. I think there are many students who think same with me. In my opinion, there are few reasons that why students who study science want to study at abroad. 
 First, there are various experts in the world. So if there are an expert who study the parts that you want, I think you should go there and study with those experts. For me and almost of KAIST students will have some parts that we want to study. If there aren’t experts of those parts in out country, almost of them will go to abroad for there study. 
 Second, just if you like other countries’ educational attitude. Every countries have different educational attitude, so if you like other country’s one, you can choose that and go there to study. For example, in our country, educational system is good for students who is good at various parts. So if someone has gifted for only one part, that student is not easy to attend high level of universities in our country. Those students go abroad and study only one part that they had gifted. 
 In summary, students who find experts of the part that they want to study attend abroad universities if experts are at the abroad. Some people who think their country’s educational system is not proper for them decide to go abroad that have system which is proper to them. There are many students who want to go abroad, and I think our country should support them and try to make various experts in scientific parts in our country and find best educational system that as many as possible students think that is proper.

1884	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"The Advantage of Studying Abroad
     What university do you want to attend? I think that almost students in Korea will say Seoul University. If I ask this question to students who study very well, they will respond famous abroad universities. I think many students choose to attend universities  because of two reasons, high quality and chance to face different cultures.
     First, students want to go to high quality university. Students want to earn a lot of money or study more professional, so they choose famous university.  I also want to learn mechanical engineering professional, so I choose Kaist. Generally, high quality universityies usually are located outside their home countries. Of course, each countries have very nice universities, but students want to go to famous universities like Havard and MIT. When they attend them, they can study more imformations that that they want to learn and have more chances to earn money. They also have more chances to get jobs which they want.
     The second reason is that students want to face various cultures. The best way to meet different culture is trip, but it is expensive for students and too short to learn something.  The easiest way to meet different culture is internet, but it is just watching pictures and videos. When students go to abroad university, they can meet students from many various countries. While they live together, they can learn each cultures like language, rule and lifestyle. When I did presentations about biology in this fall semester, my partner was from other country. In his case, Kaist is university oustide his home countries. He asked me lifestyle of Korean high school students and talk about it. Moreover, students can face the culture of country that the university is located by walking around cities near the university.
     As a result, many students want to study abroad with these two reasons. They want to study with high quality and chance to have good job with good pay. Also, they want to experience culture of other countries. I think the first reason is real reason to study abroad. Many adults say that going good university is the purpose of students. I also agree, but it would be better to go university which are related with the work you want to do. Study hard and choose university."	4	3.5	3.5	11
1885	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	" The Korean proverb, ""to see is more better than to read"" suggests that direct experience is important. Then how about in study? study abroad and get informations directly is more bette than just reading some articles in library. Actually, I will give two reasons why some students study abroad.
 First, we can learn other countries' knowledge. Each country has own technology that makes their countries strong. It can be a way of making something or a way of experiment in laboratory or a process of discussing and establishing some thesis. By studying abroad, we can get various technology and decide best one of them ourselves. 
 Second, we can be taught by someone whom we want. In each ground of study, there is famous professor in different countries. If some student want to be taught by the profssor not in their home country, than the student decides to study abroad. It is good way to the student because getting lecture directly is more better than watch lecture video or read the articles written by the professor.
 To summarize, students study abroad because the technology and people of other countries. Each county in the world has different technology and people, students who study abroad can learn various things that have never learned in their home countries. Therefore, if you want to make and decide your own best knowledge, it is good to study abroad. "	4	4.5	3.5	12
1886	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	"Studying in Germany is my dream. We can get different experiences in other country, for example, life in campus or communication with professor. Many students study abroad for two reasons.
  First, we can get honor. I think this is the obvious reason about it. There are many famous collages, like MIT, in other countries. Many students go abroad to entrance those collage. If they graduate that, they 
  Second, we can study about different subject. Each country has their own strength in study. For example, in Germany, where I want to go, they study more about the basis of science than others. They have many labs studying about them. On the other hand, in Korea, we study more about engineering. Like this, Each country have different tendency of research. It is a good choice that students study in other country that research interesting topic."	2.5	3.5	3.5	9.5
1887	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	" When we look at advertisements of universities in Korea, they always say ""If you come in our university, you can attend universities outside Korea."". Studying abroad is so attractive in people who experience the study of foreign. Today, I think some reasons why do some students study abroad.
 First reason is that the student experience foreign culture. Person in only his country may not know the cultures of other countries, so the view looking the world will be closer and closer. If people who want to learn something in the world have the wide view looking the world, they may get great ideas via something in their life.
 Second reason is that the student can get the energy to study hard. In the place where people study aboroad, people who study hard and have their own thought with their life may be a lot. Meeting these people, person who study abroad may get the will to study hard.
 Third reason is that the student can meet a variety of people. There are a variety of people in the world, but you can't meet all of them if you live in only one countries. There is a old saying that ""You can know 10 flowing, but can't know person's mind."". So I think it is good to meet many people they can. In this context, if people study abroad, they can meet the different types of people who live in their country.
 In summary, I think it is good to study abroad because people's view can be wider than before. There are a lot of benefits to study abroad. So if you feel interesting to that, why don't you consider studying abroad? Thank you."	3.5	4	3	10.5
1888	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	" Nowadays, people can go many countries easily. So student can attend schools or universities outside their home countries and some students do that. Students can experience many situation at other countries. They can study new cultures and language and can make new friends. I think that there are many reasons that they choose outside their home countries and I'll explain about these three reasons.
 First, they want to learn about other countries cultures and make new friends. Because most students want to make new friends and learn about other cultures, they want to attend schools or universities at other countries. At this situation, they can lean about countries' language as well as many cultures and it's very good situation.
 Second, they want to study hard for their vision. Sometimes, there are no way to learn about some studies in home countries. So, when students want to learn those studies, they need to go other countries. At this situation, student can study what they want to know and they can feel happy.
 Finally, parents think that their children need to attend schools or universities at other countries. Some parents think that if their children attend schools or universities outside their home countries, they can be more smart and brilliant. However, Sometimes they can't adapt other countries environment and they can feel bad. So at this situation, less students feel happy.
 Due to these three reasons, students attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Some students want to experience other countries and others want to study more deeply. Sometimes, their parents hope that students can be more smart. At these all situations, they can get many experient and feel something strange. I hope that these experients and emotions are good things."	4	4.5	3.5	12
1889	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	" Have you ever studied in foriegn countries? Nowadays, many universities and institutions provide a chance to study abroad. There are three positive effects of abroad study.
 First of all, students can learn proper social reaction and perspective. Foriegn countries have different regulations and culture. It makes various types of people live in foriegn countries. For example, in US, there is tip culture, which is a price which is not in reciept. Those cultures make students' perspective more widely, and let them have better social reaction.
 Second, students can develop their language skill. Usually, students outside hometown should use foriegn languages, as well as their hometown language. Therefore, their language skill is always being developed. In addition, language skill of different languages are not independent. It means, students can improve their language skill entierly, and it is useful even if they came back to hometown.
 Finally, students can consider more option of jobs. By studying abroad, they can attend companies and institutions in country they studied in. For instance, there are many IT companies in Us, known as silicon valley.
 In short, study in foriegn counries has three benefits. They can improve their social action and language skills, by living in foriegn countries. In addition, they also can get a chance to attend a job. It If you have a chance to study in foriegn contries, I recommend you to attend it."	3.5	4.5	4	12

" Now, it is hard to visit foreign country because of COVID-19.  Probably many people can just planned trip schedule and I am one of those people. In my case, I planned about visiting Japan. I think Japan is good to visit for few reasons and I'll explain of them now.
 First, Japan trip spend less money than visiting other foreign country. Japan is the most closest country to South Korea so we spend less money to moving such as by ship or airplane. Also, food in Japan is not that much expensive. For example, sushi, ramen, or noodle are not expensive as we know. 
 Moreover, Japan's food and culture is familiar to us. If we visit to other country, we can't enjoy when food or culture of that country doesn't fit with us. But we sometimes experienced Japan's food and culture. For example there are some restaurant that provide Japan's food so we can experience Japan's food and culture at there. 
 Finally, there are lot of things that we can do when visiting Japan. We can find delicious foods, experience Japan's culture such as kimono, there are lot of festivals, find beautiful places and people who like animation can visit place where famous with animation. Moreover it is easy to find Korean tour guide in Japan so we also can use them and we could know deeper about Japan.
 For conclusion, Japan trip is chip, Japan's food and culture is familiar to us, and there are lot of things we can do. Because of these reasons, I think the Japan trip is the best than visiting other foriegn country. So if I have the opportunity to visit a foreign country, I will choose Japan to visit."	3	4	2.5	9.5

I'm a game and electronic device ""Otaku"" someone loves Nintendo games and old device of human computor history.


""Otaku"" means someone who love anime, games or something maniac: For example, ""Pokemon Otaku"" means someone who plays all series of Pokemon games or loves all stuff of them.
In Japan, there is many companys developed legendary series of game or anime, like Nintendo. So there is many clubs, shops, parks for ""Otaku"".
The center of them, there is Akihabara, an huge street of Tokyo.

There is many exciting things:
 ""Comike"", the biggest festival of anime fan clubs on each quater of year,
 ""Yodobashi Camera"", the hugest electronic store,
 Even... ""Slot streets"". 

Isn't it exciting?

I think Akihabara is an Utopia to me, and it is located in Japan.

1892	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Many people hope to take a travel to another country for their hobbies, and I am the one of them. If I could, I would like to visit Japan. There are several reasons to say that.
 First of all, Japan offers the most spaces for arcade games including rhythm games around the world. I love all kinds of rhythm games, so Japan is the optimal country to enjoy my hobby . Because Japan has a high-level industry of such games, the costs for playing it in Japan is lower than that in Korea. Thus, we can find many people who visited Japan for such reason when we try to search.
Next, Japan has relatively short distance with Korea. Let us just think about when we travel the U.S. from Korea by an airplane. From the moment that we arrive at the station, we cannot sleep at the first night because of the time difference between Korea and the U.S. However, if we go to Japan, the time difference is quite short, and it is easy to be used to the standard time there. It also costs low due to the short flight.
The final reason is that Japanese is my 3rd most familiar language. I sometimes read comic books and animations made from Japan. In addition, I took a Japanese conversation course in last semester though I had dropped. These kinds of facts will help me not to get stressed about practical conversation and to focus on the activity.
 I would have cheap, confortable, and fun times for two weeks if I have the opportunity to visit any country. I hope I will be free from my studies."	3	4	3.5	10.5
1893	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"If I have the opportunity to visit foreign country for 2 weeks, I would like to go to New Zealand. There are three reasons why I chose New Zealand. 
First, I want to meet my foreign friends and homestay family in New Zealand. When I was first grade in middle school, I've been to the New Zealand. Our school gave me an opportunity to go and study there for a month. While I lived there, I could make precious experiences and memories with my school friends and homestay family. I've kept in touch with my intermediate school friend in New Zealand until these days, but not with my homestay family.  I wonder how the baby-she's one of  homestay family-grew up. So I want to visit and meet them again. 
Second one is that I want to go various New Zealand's  tour attractions. When I stayed there shortly, I lived Auckland(can't remember spell is right) which is in north part of New Zealand, so I couldn't travel the south island.  I really want to see aurora and other snow-filled landscapes, because I love cold and snowy things.  Also, if time is allowed, I think it's a great idea to go to the places I went in the past. It can remind my hidden memories there and also I can feel the change of those places. 
Also, among these COVID-19, New Zealand is one of the cleanest countries that has no viruses. For about 2 years, I've been suffered by masks and couldn't play well because of social- distancing policy and anxiety in Korea. I want to go countries without corona virus, get some real rest, and feel like going back when there was no corona virus. 
Therefore, I would like to go to New Zealand If I can go, because I can meet my foreign friends and family, go south island, and  there is no virus. I miss my everything in New zealand, and I will be happy to visit there again. "	4	4	3.5	11.5

" What country do you want to visit if COVID-19 pedimic is over? I want to visit USA, especially Portland. There are three reasons why.
 Firstly, It's because I've missed a chance to visit Portland. About 3 years ago, I visited Seattle as my parents' 20th marry anniversity. Though Seattle and Portland is quiet close, we couldn't visit Portland because we lent a house for whole travel days. As driving Seattle to Portland by car takes much time and tired, we decided to visit other places in Seattle. It was so sad for me. So if I have a chance to visit a foreign country for 2 weeks, I'll choose Portland, USA.
 Secondly, Portland is a great place to have fun. In Portland, there are are many ports . Near ports, there are various cultures and people. As there are many visitors, there are lots of famous and exciting thing to do such as world-famous burger. That's why I want to visit Portland.
 Thirdly, I want go to USA again. When I visited Seattle 3 years ago, I really liked the atmosphere. As I could see lots of trees, forests, sceinic parks. all green things, I felt comfortable and really refreshing. If I have a chance to go USA again for 2 weeks, I would visit more places  without my past mistake.

There are many countries I want to go. But If someone ask me which country do you want to go, I choose France first. There are some reasons.

The first reason is there are many beautiful place in France. When I was young, I saw one TV program. That program is documentary about Europe, and some people visit many countries in Europe. For example, They visit Germany, England, Fracne and Italy.   I saw many beutiful places in Europe. But my best pick of beautiful places in Europe is France museum, and park. France are famous for art, and many famous museum are built in France. For example, National France Museum and Rubre Museum are most famous museum in France. I can see Monalisa and other famous pictures in France museum. I can saw many masterpieces, and take many picuture. When I finish France tour, that memory will remember longer. 

The second reason is there are many delicious food in France. France are famous for food, and many famous chef work in France restaurant. I saw many chef work in  France restaurant which have 2 stars or 3 stars. Also Wolrd's best 3 menu are sold in Fracne a lot. In Korea, many france style restaurnat built in Seoul and other place. But If I want to eat real Frace food, the best way is go to Fracne. There are many delicious coffee, and bread. If I go to France, when I finish tour, I will buy France cooffe, and bread and give to my friends and neighbors.  

The third reason is I want to make good memory with my family. Actually Our family went to U.S.A and many other Asia countries. But we haven't visited country in Europe. So Europe tour is our dream. When we talk about Europe tour, everyone's first pick is France. We want to visit France because of our individual reasons. My father main reason is eat delicious food, My mother main reason is visit many beautiful place in Fracne, and take family picture. My younger brother main reason is go to art museum and see many master pieces. Our individual main reason is different, but the mind that want to go Fracne is same.

Moreover, America has a lot of natural and cultural heritages. In America, there are cold area near to Canada and hot area like desert near to Mexico. We can choose which place is fit to travel. In big continent, amazing environments like Grand Canyon are great to visit. Also, there are not only natural goods. America is the first country that elect a president. We feel the democratic spirit and freedom from American people. I think White House can represent these minds.
At last, sport industry is well-developed in USA. American citizen enjoy baseball, football, basketball and other sports. NFL and MLB is the best league of the world. I'm a big fan of baseball, so I wanna go and watch the high-level baseball games.

"There are many countries which I want to visit. But these days, visiting foreign countries is prohibited because of covid-19, so I couldn't visit a foreign country. If I have the opportunity to visit a foreign contry, I really want to visit U.S.A. There are several reason I want to visit there.
First, I have visited some foreign countries such as France, England, Italy, Germany, China, Taiwan, but I have never visited U.S.A. I want to go and see some famous landmarks in U.S.A. Two weeks are long time to travel a foreign country. There are many states in U.S.A and it is large to travel, so it is appropriate to visit for two weeks. And Temperature is one of the important condition to visit a foreign country. U.S.A's weather is similar with Korea, that is, U.S.A is not very hot or very cold so U.S.A is good to travel.
Second, I want to communicate with foreign people in English. I am not good at English speaking rather than reading or writing, listening. So I think visiting U.S.A can be great opportunity to develop my English speaking skills. Not only practicing English myself, but also talking with foreign people who use English would be very helpful to me. After I graduate the university, I want to study in a foreign country to get master or doctor degree. So increasing English speaking skills is necessary to me. 
Finally, I want to visit my friend's house. I have a friend who has lived in Los Angeles. He always said He will invite to his house when I visit U.S.A to me. So I promised that I will visit U.S.A later. If I visit U.S.A, I can meet my friend and I can sleep at my friend's house, then I can save some money. Also he can guide me to travel U.S.A because he knows U.S.A well.
In conclusion, I would like to visit U.S.A because I have never been to U.S.A and I want to communicate in English and I want to visit my friend's house. If the covid-19 disappears and I have the opportunity to visit other countries, I really want to go U.S.A. I hope I can visit U.S.A until next year."	4	4	3	11

"Because of COVID-19, I can’t visit foreign country for 2 years. The last memory of my foreign trip was our school trip. So during the senier season at KAIST, I really want to visit foriegn countries with my family and friends. When I was high school student, I was so busy because I should study at school. At that time, my dream was trip to abroad with my friends. But it is still my dream. 
 During my senier season, I can’t trip to abroad but I can watch various kinds of video that is recorded before by other people. So I can imagine some parts of my trip after COVID-19, and make some list of my trip bucket-list. One of country that I really want to visit is Canada. The first time that I know about that country was when I watching Youtube V-log about there. The video is recorded by 4 people of friends three years ago. I was really like that because it was very similar to trip which I dream. There are two points that I really loved and hope to visit Canada. 
 First, there are many beautiful snowy views. There are many famous places that have wonderful view. Many people like snow and I am one of them. So it’s snowy view make me love Canada. There are also place that enjoy winther sports, like ski. Before COVID-19 appear, I go to ride ski every winther so I wait winther during summer. For these reasons, I really recommand Canada trip who like winther sports like me. 
 Second, Canada is very clean and we can enjoy nature in forest. Actually, I prefer nature tour more than city tour because it is hard to enjoy that in Korea. 
 It is too sad that I can’t visit foreign countries now, so I watch trip V-log sometimes. The Canada video was one of impressure video because those reasons. I can experience the snowy view , nature, and winther sports with my friends through that video. I really hope that I can visit Canada with my friends."	1.5	2.5	2.5	6.5

By visiting famous buildings, I want to feel the culture of England.
  Third, I want to walk the road of England for feeling rest. Sometimes, I want to go to the country and feel the nature of England. Also, I want to walk around with rainy weather. When I am hard to walk, I will ride a bus which has two floor and have interesting time for watching England people. I will feel free from  busy cities of England.

1907	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"If I have a chance to visit a foreign country for two weeks, I would like to visit Austrailia.

 Fisrt reason is the weather of Austrailia is different with Korea.
 When weather of Korea is very hot, Austrailia is very cold. Opposite case is same.
 So, When I'm so tired with weather like very hot or cold, I want to take opposite weather.

 Second reason is number of rand mark of Austrailia is low.
 Most of people want to visit Europe or America, because of many rand mark.
 People see those and feel so good.
 Before they feel everything of rand mark, they go out to see another rand mark.
 I think that the goal of travel is not to see every rand mark, the real goal is that we feel good and relaxed.
 So, I want to visit Austrailia to enjoy taking rest in nature, and visit a little rand mark.
 
 Third reason is to eat delicious food.
 I know the cow meat of Austrailia is very delicious because people of Austrailia educate cows in the ground.
 So I would like to eat cow meat if I visit Austrailia.
 Except to cow meat, there are many delicious food in Austrailia.
 Beacuse I have time of two weeks, during so long days, I'll eat some foods.

 So, I would like to visit Austrailia."	3.5	3.5	3	10

 First, America has many cultures. America's history is short and people who comes to various countries built America. So America's culture is mixed and various. So we can feel many countries' culture and eat various food. To meet people who have own culture, I'm able to learn about many culture and I can understand their behavior. For two weeks, I can meet many people and eat many food so I'll feel various cultures.

Therefore, chosing the country to visit will consider some factors. For several factors, Japan is great country to visit.
 First of all, Japan can be visited without paying expensive cost. Trip to western country, like US, takes large cost and long time because the countries are so far. However, Japan is the country in Eastern Asia, same as Korea, so the trip shoud take less cost.
 In addition to the cost,  there are various delicious foods in Japan. Hence Japan is a country on an island, meals with seafood are developed. For example, sushi is well known Japanese food. Also, there is marvelous beef in Japan, which is named Wagyu.

1910	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"The Qualities of A Good Student
     We have to go elementary and middle school because going to elementary school and middle school is mandatory in Korea. Thus, being a good student is important. If you are a good student, you can get a lot of advantages from school. In my opinion, honesty, friendship and passion are the qualites of a good student.
     First, honesty is a important part of a good student. The students interact to many people in school because there are many students and teachers. To develop relation, trust is necessary. Since trust can be made by showing honesy, honesty is a importnat part. The students also receive many tasks by teachers. The honesty is a necessary to make good results for tasks. 
     Not only being honesty but aslo making friendship is a quality of a good student. we can meet many people in school. During school activites, we have to interact to friends to collaboration for homeworks. Students also need friends to play. For these reasons, making friendship is very important quality of a good student. 
     Lastly, passion is also a quality of a good student. In school, students have to do many tasks. If a student don't have passion about a task, student will be bored. After student is bored, student does not want to do task. Because of this, having passion is very important. If student has passion about task, student will get good result about task. 
     As a result, I argued that the qualities of a good student are honesty, friendship and passion. Because most of people have to be students for a long time, having the qualities of a good student is important. If you have the qualities of a good student, you can enjoy your school life. "	4	4	3.5	11.5
1911	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Do You Want to Become A Good Student?
There are 4 kinds of schools; elementary school, middle school, high school and university. I have gone all of these schools for more than 12 years, so I could become better to become a good student. Also, I realized about what kind of thing makes the student better. Maybe, many of youguys have that your own qualities of a good student and try to become like that. Therefore, since everyone will be good students, I hope we can share each other's standards of becoming good students. There are three surprising opinions and reasons about the quality of a good student I think.
First, a good student make many questions in every single class. Many questions make it easier for professors to conduct classes as students participate in them. In addition, questioning can induce other students to participate in the class by making the class atmosphere good. In this reason, I think questioning students are good students and there is no disadvantage in questioning activity. You can think that 'questioning is really hard and scary thing because some questions can disturb the class and my questions are seem to have low qualities.'. But, I think you don't have to worry about that because classes need questions, not high quality questions. Just questioning often is helpful for classes and it's important to becaome a good student.
Second, a good student always have their own books. Since the school teacher distributes printed materials to students who do not have books, I saw many friends who deliberately didn't carry books. That kind of behavior must disturb the class. If there are more students who don't have books than the number of printed materials, the teacher should go office and print more papers. During this time, other good students could not take the class because of some students' selfishness. These days, we can put all of books in tablet pcs such as ipad. Therefore, we can have all kinds of books by just having a one single ipad so I recommend youguys to buy a tablet or something to have all books comfortely.
Finally, a good students do not sleep during everyclass. Sleeping students can make professors or teachers not enthusiastic. Also, other students can feel more sleepy when they see sleeping students. For these reasons, if you want to become a good student, just try not to sleep during the classes. But, I know that there are too many assignments, classes and studying things. I know that you are really hard to take everyclass, but I recomment you just try no to sleep. Moreover, I heard that there are so many scientific antisleep products, so just try to using those things! If you take everyclass, your grade will be much better too!
In summary, I think good students don't sleep during classes, make many questions and always have books. I have ben in high school practicing this kind of life, so I think I was able to come to a very good school named 'KAIST'.  Of course, I think your opinions are important too, but if you do not mind, I hope youguys can pratice these my opinions at least once. Let's try to become a good student!"	4.5	4	4	12.5
1912	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Most of us have students' life.  We try to be a good student in school. I feel that a good studet has good listening, active helping, and passion. 
First,  good students listen to friends or teachers well. Hearing is very important in school life. In the class, If we concentrate the contents about study, we can get a good score. Also, we can keep us from making conflicts. There is no misunderstanding between friends if they listen carefully to each other. For example, I have a opinion conflict with my friend about presentation. My friend do not want to fight with me, so he listened to my opinion for a long time. As result, we can adjust our opinions. Because we heard carefully each other, we can solve a problem well.  
In addition to listening, good students help friends well. If friends do not help each other in a hard situation,  they can occur problems. However, by giving friends a hand, they can make a close relationship between them. As time goes on, friends that get a help from good students help another friends, and they can be a good friend. In this process, one good friend can have a good effect on other friends in school.
Finally, a good student does the best in all the works. Passionate students can have good results since they do various tries. If they do not get a good result, they do not frustrate because they are positive. They think it is a chance to develop themselves, so this can lead to good attitude in school life.
To summarize,  to be a good friend is important in our school life. If you listen to your friends or teachers carefully,help each other, and have passionate thought, you can be a good student. I think a good friend can have a good influence on school."	4.5	4	3.5	12
1913	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Nowadays, all young people go to school and they become students. Students learn knowledge, make friends, and learn how to live with people. As we do many things in school, becoming good students is very important for our lives. I think there are two qualities of a good student. A good student study well and respect old people.
    First of all, students have to study hard. Study is reason of going to school. We learn huge amount of knowledge and it is very helpful to live a life. For example, if who didn't study about basic laws do illegal thing, it can be punished. Understanding how to live is important for students.
    Not only study, but also respect is quality of a good student. Students should respect old people in school like teachers. When we start social life, there are many old people than us. Old people are wise and we can get a lot of benefits through them. We can practice social life through respect teacher.
     To sum up, "	3	3.5	3.5	10
1914	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     Including KAIST students, many 20 years old people in korea are student. Almost of them want to be a good student. There are two important qualities of a good student.
     First of all, studying hard is important qualities of a good student. Because they are student, they should study hard. Student learn a lot of knowledge in their university. The role of student is to study hard until they know everything about which they learned. In addtion to knowledge, student can learn many subject. For example,  they can learn langueage which they do not learn in university, relationship between friends and way to reach their dream. If students know about many knowledge, langueage, relationship and way, they can approach their next step which different by person. For instance, if person who want to be a member of SAMSUNG, he or she can be member of SAMSUNG with high GPA and various experience relate to SAMSUNG which he or she study when they are student. Student is just one of steps to achieve their own happiness. As a result, studying hard makes people can achieve their own happiness, so to practice hard is important qualites of good student.
     In addition to studying hard, to experience a lot is a important qualities of a good student. 20 years are not  long time, so student cannot know about many phenomenons, principles and cases on life. Many experiences help people to make better choice than before. For example, when people choose their company, a lot of informations by experiences make people can choose the best company. People have to make a choice while they live their life. There is famous sentence about choice, BCD, which means between Birth and Death there is choice. Students can imporve more than before, and they can live better life with their better choice. Experience makes students can choice nice option on their life, so experience is a important qualities of a good student.
     Qualities of a good student are studying hard and to experience a lot. 20 years is not long time and it means people can make many changes on their life. I hope all of student in KAIST be a good student and also enjoy their life."	4.5	4	4	12.5
1915	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Qualities of  a Good Student
  Students must have various conditions and attitudes to become good students. In my opinion, there are three important qualities of  a good student. Let's read and see if you're a good student.
  First of all, a good student has willingness to learn. It's a fact that person who has a willingness to own goal can complete something to do. If a student doesn't have any willingness to learn at all, he or she never learn and study hard. Also he or she can't be a good student.
  The second quality of a good student is diligence. Personally, I think only diligent people can do everything and succeed. When student putting off what he or she has to do, the student can't improve and can't finish the plan. Therefore, a lazy student will learn something that is not complete.
  Finally, a good student always respects the teacher. It is true that student should believe, understand and listen to a teacher that students respect. So, a student who respects the teacher will study harder and become better student.
  To sumarize, I believe that the three qualities of a good student are willingness to learn, diligence and respect for the teacher. If you want to be a good student, try to have these three qualities. Being a good student will help you reach your goal."	3.5	4	4	11.5
1916	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"There is many students that is different a little bit each other. Some students are concentrating for lecture, and some students are participating well for class.  Even some students are sleeping or playing game during the class. Then, what are the qualities of a good student? Well, although some people doesn't agree with my idea, I'm going to explain the three qualities of a good student.
    First of all, I think good students should make their own thing from the class. I think students should understand the lecture. Even though we can't understand for many reasons, we should beg a help for professor or other students about the parts that we need a help after the lecture. Then, when we fully understand for the lecture, I think we can make our own thing like I learned how to write the essay and how to send my opinion effectively in English after the IRW class. We don't have to make the wonderful things, but just a own thing although it is simple.
    Second, good students should participate well for the class. When I explain the lecture to my friends after the class, I wasn't able to know they fully understand my explanation because they just hear my voice and write what I tell to my friends. So, I asked them ""Do you understand my explanation?"", and they say sometimes ""Yes."", but sometimes they say ""Actually, I can't understand the part about this."".  The problem is that I can't notice when they understand and they don't understand. So, I questioned to them during the teaching about the lecture. If they say the correct answer, then we were going to next part. If they say the wrong answer, then I asked the difficult part to understand. After that, I noticed that the participation for the class is important. It is important not only for the students to understand more efficiently, but also teachers or professors can notice students are understanding the lecture or not.
    Finally, this is choice, I think good students explain what they learned to other friends or somebody. I think teaching is the best way to check if I understand about the lecture. It is helpful not only for the friends who doesn't understand the lecture, but also the person who teaching about the lecture. If I don't understand the lecture, then I won't explain the lecture naturally, and notice what I don't understand. In addition, we can remember more accurately to explain about the lecture. When we just hear the lecture, then we can forget easily, so we should teach other people.
    To summarize,  although qualities of a good student are different for the people, I think explaining the lecture, participation for the class, and making their own thing is important. I think being good students is good for me, and other students, and professor. So, we should try to be the good students."	4	3.5	3.5	11
1917	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Many students may wonder if they are good students or not. And many people may had tried to be a good student in the class. Then, what is a good student? There are two main qualities of a good student.
     First of all, good students should have enthusiasm. Students can learn and memorize more knowledges when they study by themselves than when they are forced to study. However, without enthusiasm of learning, they just study because they have to study. This kind of study which have no purpose, is not helpful for students. Therefore, to be a good student, students should have passion for study.
     Not only passion, curiosity is also the quality for a good student. Students can develop themselves by asking questions that are related to the knowledge which they learned in the class. The origin of questions is curiosity. If students don't feel curious about the knowledge, his or her studying will be end just by understanding and memorizing it. However, if students finish studying with old knowledges that already written on the paper and do not create new ideas, the world can't be developed. The final purpose of studying is to make a new theory or technology based on old knowledges. Accordingly, curiosity is the important quality of a good student to think and create a new knowledge by asking a question.
     To summarize, the qualities of a good student are having enthusiasm of learing and having curiosity for what they learned. It is because, these two qualities help students to study by themselves and think creatively. It might be difficult to be a good student in a day, but if you try consistently to have a passion and feel curious in the class, then you can be a good student."	4.5	4	4.5	13
1918	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"The Most Important Qualities to Be a Good Student
     Almost all teenagers go to school and take classes. They learn many things, not only the subjects but also society from their teacher.  When they study in school, some students are called 'good student', and other are called not good. There are many qualities to be a good student, but I think curiosity, cooperation , faithfulness is the most important qualities for students.
     First, I think the curiosity is very important for students. To study hard some topics, we should be curious about it. If we are not interested in the topic, we can't study it passionable. I think that to be a good student, we must love the subject and then we can focus the class more. Therefore, I think the curiosity and interest is a important quality.
     Not only the curiosity, but also the cooperation is significant quality to be a good student. We can learn faster and better by cooperating with our friends. We can grow more when we discuss some problems with peers and success to solve the problem. If you are good at math and your friend is good at biology, you can study math and biology more efficiently with your friends.
     Finally, faithfulness is also the most important quality for students. I think although you are not good at a subject, if you do your homework daily, and study the subject sincerely, you are able to become a master of the subject. Also, There is no one who hate faithful person. Therefore, you can give your teacher good impress.
     To summarize, to become a good student, curiosity, cooperation, and faithfulness is the most important three qualities. In school, we learn many subjects, meet many friends and do many other activities. In these many activities, the students grow up and learn society qualities. To live in school well, I think the qualities not only in the above paragraph but not in there are very very important. I hope many students remember the qualities like curiosity, co-working and faithfulness and become good students who enjoy the school lives."	4	4	4	12

In addition to find them, you would feel something to each of them in terms of student, and also you can realize what are the qualities of a good student.

 The first quality of a good student is effort. The word ""student"" means a person who learn something, so it is necessary to doing effort to his learning. Also, students often get a part for a work in their group such as class and shcool. A good students do thier best on their work, so their groups can do more effectively. 
  In addition to the effort, the second important quality of a good student is honest. In many cases, honest is essential for good students, but many students don't be honest for their examination. All students have to take thier examination, and they may get scores of each subjects. For example, if a teacher gave points  more than a student's original score, there are few students to say teacher honestly.  
 To summarize, good students have three qualities those are effort, honest and kindness. I think effort, honest, kind students are good students, so I recommend you to do your best to be those student. After being that student, you can be better student against before."	3	3	3	9

    Nowadays all of us know the importance of education. Beyond that, we should know How can we become  good students. Students are people who study. However, Can we say a person as a good student if he only study well? I don't think so. To become a good student, we should care more points. There are three qualities of a good friend.
    First of all, good students should try hard to reach their goal. There are teachers and parents who think student should study science, math, and English hard. However, these are just method to reach their goal. Not every student should study these. For example, if a student want to become soccer player, he should play soccer a lot. 
    Good students not only try hard to reach their goal, but also make good environment. Good students affect other student to try hard and good students communicate well with their teacher well and learn a lot. In Korea, there is a word ""geunmugjageug"". This means if a peoson closes to black thing, the person become black. People are affected by environment around them. So, good student should make good environment to reach their goal easily.
    Although good student make good environment, good student do many other activities. We don't know what will happen in the future. If a person try really hard to become a basketball player, but there is possibility that his height's growing is stop immedietly. Then what can he do? Good students should experience many other things and make 2nd choices. In addition, experiences in many topics can help a student to reach his goal. Nowadays, we cannot achieve great job without communicate people who are in other topic. various experiences will help communicating.
    In conclusion, Good students should try hard to reach their goal, make environment which help them, and do many other activities. It will be great if we use this information and become a good student."	4	3.5	3.5	11

There are many students in our society. And also many people were students when they young. Teachers meet a lot of students in school and experience many kinds of students. Teachers sometime say that he is a good student. Almost people think that a good student have to study well. But that think  is not right. Then what is the qualities of a good student.
First, good students have to be nice to their teacher. Teachers teach students to go right way in their life. So teachers are helpful people to students. Than students have to follow teachers well. Then they get many good knowledge. Teacher are teach not only studying but also knowledge about life. So students have to have thanksful mind to their teacher. Therefore good students have to be nice to their teacher and learn hard from teacher.
Moreover, good students have to play well with their friends. Many people said that friends the most valuable treasure in the world. Because there are many points to learn to your friends and friends can help you when you are in hard situations. Also you have to help friends who are in hard situations. So good students have to play well with their friends and help friends. For example, friend can't solve some problems, than you help him to solve that problem. And if you have some snacks. than share the snacks with your friends. It is good students that play well with your classmate.
Finally, good students have to do their own work. Study is not only the way for the success. There are many other way to be success their life. Some students want to be a chef, and some students want to be a sports player. Than they do their own work hard. Students have to do their own work because of their dream. Student period is time to prepare your dream. So good students have to do their own work for improve theyself.

1923	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"There are many types of students. Such as some students are good at studying, and others are good at exercising. However, there are not many people to do their best. I think the quality of good students  is to do their best for what they want.
      First of all, doing their best is improving themselves. I think good students improve forever. If somepeople do our best in something, they can get new information about that. Also, they can get exprience about that.  They think about exprience and information. They  find their week parts about them and improve that. They repeat this way and they will be a very strong person about that part.
     The second reason that the quality of good students is doing their best give good effect to their friends. Good students need to give good effects for their friends. It is because they can improve together. In my case, I meet a friend who want to be a movie director. He always watches movie and thinks about stories. After I meet him, I think I need to find what I want. It is because I respect him. So, I can find my dream. Just like me, they can get good effects to their friends. 
     Finally, they can give good effects to society. I think they can give good effect about two parts. The first part is improving the part which they like. The students grow up, he can be a great person about that part. And, these people meat each other, they make big changes just like AI. Another part is that new students can learn about their mind. The most important part of children is mind, they have good mind about doing something. It is just like we make some rollmodel. Then, our society have many good students before. It means our society is improving.
     In conclusion, the quality of good students is doing their best what they want. They can give good effects to themselves, their friends, their society. So, we need to think what we really like and try to do our best in that part."	3.5	3	2.5	9
1924	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"A Good Qulites of a Student
     Do you think that you were a good student when you were young? Almost people experienced in elementary school or middle school, and even teachers and professors were students in past. There are many qualities of a good student but I believed the most important two qualites are honest and doing his best all time.
     First, honesty is one of important qualitys for teeneger. There are a lots of exams in school, and students should do them. If a student cheats other person in exam, he will get a zero grade and lose teacher's believing mind. Students also should make many relationship of friends and teachers, and basis of relationships is to be honest each other.
     In addition to honesty, a student doing his best all time is good student. A school is place where student study about many subjects such like math, science. Although some students hate studying, they should listen teacher's explainations in classes and do their homeworks. Because students get grades by their attitudes and homeworks, they always do best in their school life.
     To sum up, honesty and doing their best are necessary for students. If you are student, I recommend that you remember and conduct these quailties. Then, you can get good scores in exams and be a good student for teacher."	3.5	3.5	3	10

     As we live, we expirienced being a student at least one time. Some of teachers judge us as good students, but others think us like bad students. 
In this situation, what are qualities of a good student? I claim that fast studying skill, kindness, curiosity are those. 
     First of all, a good student is fast learner. Because a nature of students is to learn, we can substitue the word student to learner. As a result,
in this context ""a good student"" means a good learner, who has a fast studying skill. 
     Addition to good learning skill, curiosity is also a quality of a good student. Many of students conceal their curiosity in their school life. However, 
curiosity is important thing for whole life. And different from many student, most good students have an eagerness to study. Consequently, curiosity
is also a quality of being a good student. 
     Beside of curiosity, a good student helps other students. A school is substitue not only for education, but also for socialization. Socialization means 
boys and girls become adults for our society. To become a mature person in our society, we need helpful mind in our heart. Therefore, a good student 
must have kindness. 
     In conclusion, a good student must have good learning skill, mind to study, and helpful mind. If you keep this paragragh in your mind, you can be a 
good student. It doesn't matter whether you were a good student before, or not.  "	3	2.5	2.5	8
1926	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" To be a good student
     Many people say that you must be a good student. Then, you might have questions, 'What is a good student?', or 'What are the qualities of a good student?'. If you ask these questions to teachers or parents, they often say 'studying hard and getting a good grade'. They alwalys say 'a good grade'. They might be right, but I believe thar there are more important standards for a good student.
     First of all, attending every classes you take and submitting all assignments is the most important. A student who is very smart and can solve every math problems is also good. But he misses classes a lot, he would be graded low. Attendance is a factor of your mind to deal with a task. To make your dream coming true and prepare for social activities, it is essential to participate in all classes.
     Besides attendance, studying by yourself is also important. In university, it is hard to find materials such as books with many math or physics problems that can help you study. because of that fact, you have to study by yourself. If you lack the ability to study deeply and utilize contents you learn, you might not survive in the university. Subjects in colledge are very hard and the materials which can help  you are limited, so you have to improve your skill to study by your own hands.
     To sum up, attendance and the ablility to study by yourself are the qualities of a good student. With these two, you are able to get a good reputation, solve the crisis that you confront, and eventually make your dream come true."	3.5	4	3.5	11
1927	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Nowadays, there are many people who do not marry and do not make family. In this social situdtion, friends became more important. People need comfortable home. In this sociaty which has a lot of one-people family, friend do that role instead of family. So, what is good friend? There are two qualities of a good friend.
First, relationship with good friend beyond material. We can just communicate with people at business. good friends do more than that. We can comunicate with good friend anytime and anywhere with no reason. Good friend can help me if there are losing his money and  time. 
Second, good friend should be comfortable. It is important that take care friend's feel. However, It does not mean that you need to do everything for him. there should be some mistakes and bad situations. Good friend is someone feel comfortable when I do mistake and it make me comfortable too.
third, good friend should be fun with me. If someone is kind and comfortable, but he is not fun with me, he is not a good friend. We spend much time with friend. So it is really important that I feel great when spend time with him.
In conclusion, good friend has realtionship beyond material,  good friend is comfortable and fun when I spend time with him. Good friend is getting more important right now. How about make good friend and comunicate each other?"	3	3	2.5	8.5
1928	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  People around the world all have their close friends. Some people think that friend is more close than family. Than, what is a good friend? Just spending long time  can make good friend? Today, I'm going to talk about the qualities of a good friend.
  First, good friend doesn't make you feel so bad. You and your friend must be respecful each other as a person. When your friend ignore you and make feel bad, he couldn't be a good friend. For example, you and your friend go to PC room. You guys are doing a team game and you don't do very well. At this situation, good friend will encourage you, not just ignore you. 
  Second, good friend can disrupt you when you go to bad ways. Good friends can give you advice, although that will hurt your mind. They don't want you to go to bad situation, so they always like to give you advice objectively. For example, they will block you smoking in high school. But bad friends will maybe smoke together. 
  Last, person that makes you always happy when you play with him is a good friend. Although you and your friend are very close, it will be hard to play together that each of them likes different one. Let's think about one situation. Your friend likes to play outside like doing sports, or take a trip. But you likes to do everything in home such as watching videos, or playing a game. Then one of them must be tired when they play together. Taking care of each other is important but their playing style is also important, either.  
  Some people feel depressed that they don't have many friends. But, it means that you have very nice friends who take care of you, feel sad when you feel sad too. Don't be sad, and think about your good friends. When you come up with thankful things to friends, why don't you call them right now?  "	2.5	3	2.5	8
1929	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I have lived in the same hometown name Sinseo in Daegu. So all of my friends are live near my home and I graduated same elementary, middle, high schools with my friends. Therfore my friends are not very variety and I do not have so many friends.
But after become a student of KAIST, this become diffirent. I met so many friends and their hometowns are totally diffirent. When I was not a freshman, I think that I do not know about what are the qualities of a good freind. But now, I think that I can make some definitions about good friends.
 Let me talk about what good friends are.
 First, I think someone who makes phone calls or sends messeges me faster than I do is very good friends because sending messeges are making phone call first mean that the person often think about you and he/she wants to be more friendly with you.
Some people can think sending messeges and making phone calls too much are very annoying things but I want to say only one sentence for them.
'Please do not lose friends who really care about you.'
 Second thing is super important. I think we should never make friends who talk behind someone's back.
Some people can think like this. 'That actions from my frineds are not my fault and the actions do not hurt me. So I do not matter that.'
But these thinking is super dangerous. I sware that those friends have must talked behind your back.
'Friends who hurt other people must hurt you too.'
Third, good frineds usually use good words.
For example, good freinds talk such like 'I like you.', 'You can make well.', 'Sorry to hear that.' but bad friends use bad words such as 'fxck', 'idxot', 'bixch'.
There can be "	1.5	2.5	2.5	6.5

There are a lot of personal types and they are all different and various. Along there, I think 2 things, which are the qualities of a good friend, including mind and having good thing which I should have.
First quality is mind for helping. When I was high school student, I feel very huge burden and tired because of my grade. I can't even eat meals well due to stress. One of my friends is worry me and my healthy, so she took a milk-bread every day for me. (In past, I told her that I really like bread.) Also, she encouraged me and often gave some advices. ""Don't worry. You're already doing best."" I'm very touched and thank for her. Now she is my most favorite friend.
Next, the second quality is having good thing(or some advantages) which I should have or learn.  In Korea, there is a proverb, ""Go to Gang-nam along friend."" "	1.5	2.5	2	6
1931	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" People meet many people and some people be a friends. With friends, people can feel fun and develop each other. On the other hand, some friends are not good. There are three ideas of what are the qualities of good friend.
 First of all, talking about their feeling honestly is qualities of a good friend. There are various people in world, and everyone has diffrence with others even friends. Sometimes opinion is not same between friends. Both people will upset and hard to understand each other. If one of them talk about their feeling and opinion honestly, they will be close again, but nobody talk about their feeling and opinion henestly it takes a lot of time to close again.
 In addition, having same hobby is qualities of a good friend. People spend much time with their friends. Going trip with friends is good activity to spend time with friends, but it is hard to go trip oftenly. Therefore people need to do their hobby with friends. Many hobbies are usually not only can do oftenly and also good to spend time with friends. People will not fight because of having diffrent hobby, but if they have same hobby with their friends, they will be a good friends.
 Lastly, communication oftenly is a qualities of a good friend. Communication is important to improve friendship. 'What do you do today'?, 'Is there any special event?' are good examples of communication. These examples are simple, but there is no better question to know others life. Some people usually live near from thier friends' house, because they have to meet for getting closer. Also some people who live far from their friends' house, because it is possible to communicate with internet. Living far or near from friends' house is not important. Communication oftenly is important.
 To sum up, talking about their feeling honestly, having same hobby and communication oftenly is a qualities of good friend."	3.5	3	3	9.5
1932	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" People meet many friends in their life. And because all friends are different, you may felt that some friends are good and some friends are bad. Then, what are the qualities of a good friend? I think honesty and kindness are the most important quality to be a good friend. In this writing, I will explain why I think like this with some examples.

 First, honesty is very important for the real friendship. without honesty, we can not trust others even if he or she is my friends. Let me give you my experience as an example.  In my high school days, I had a chance to participate in science contest as a team. So I asked my friend to be a team with me. But she had rejected this and explained that she was so busy that she doesn't have enough time to take part in that contest. As a result, I found another friend to join the contest. However, she finally be revealed that join the contest with other friend. I was so sad and angry that she lied to me and I also think that I can't trust her anymore. But after that, she came to me first and explained that she already had had an appointment to join the contest together with other friend and she lied me because she thought that I would hurt my mind if she told the truth. After her explanation, we strengthen our relationship and promised that never lie to eachother. From this experience, I could realize that honesty is significant quality between friends to maintain the friendship.

 Second, kindness is also important. Even if between friends, if someone being rude to another, then their relationship couldn't be long-lasting. Let's think that we have one friend that always rude to ourselves with the reason that we are just friend. The friend may think that some rude actions are okay because we are close to eachother. However, we have to endure his or her rude action not to break the relationship. As a result, we may be angry and disappoint to a friend. This is unfair. If we are friend, then we have to be kind to eachother. Rude actions are always not be accepted regardless of the closness between friends. If we being rude between friends, we can't maintain the relationthip for a long time because doing rude action is equal as attack someone's heart. For this reason, I think kindness is also very important quality of a good friend.

To summarize, in my opinion, honesty and kindness are the most significant quality of a good friend. It helps us to not only make real friendship, but also maintain relationship for a long time. For these reasons, I strongly consist that honesty and kindness are the most important."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1933	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  I think a good friend help me when I have some worries or hard problems. It is because I think it can make good interaction with each other. We can meet many problems in our life. They are not easy to solve own power. So, I think we need to have some people who can help us. 
  In my case, I graduated science high school and I have many stress in there. Because, I didn't like studying, but I needed to study hard in school. Also,  many students studied hard in school and they concentrate competition about grade.  My feeling is bad for a long time about them. This feeling makes me powerless. I slept all the time in school and I forgive study. My friends tried to make my feeling good.  They needed to study, but they think they made my feeling better is more important. At the result, I'm not depressed anymore.  I wanted to die before then. But, nowdays I like my life and I want to make more good memories with my priceless friends. Now, my goal is making good memories with people who gave me some helps. Also, I want to give lots of helps to them.
  I have another memories about some worries. When I was young, my dream is baseball player or art teacher. But, I went middle school, and I tested first middle-term exam. I have good grades about that and my score is too high. So, my parents wanted me to study. But, I didn't want. It is because I hadn't done study before then, I was scared about that. But, My friends told me ""You can do it!"". So, I had some confidence about studying. That times made me study.  At the result, I came KAIST, I think I'm little bit sucess in studying. And, I think my friends made me sucess. 
  So, I think friends can make someone's life. All the people have one risk at least in whole life. And, good friends need to be a power in that time. Then, I think giving some helps and making some good conection makes good interaction. This friends can make us live with good feeling. And, They can be a reason why we need to live hardly.

1934	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Do you have friends? And did you have events about your friends? I graduated elemantal school, middel school, and high school. So I meet many people and also I made many friends in my life. I learn that what are the qualities of a good friend by many events with my friends. Now I will talk about my think that what are the qualities of a good friend.
First, good friend must have belief. I think that friendship is based on the belief. If you don't have belief on your friends, then you can't be good friends with your friend. For example, you lost your wallet in your friend's house while playing with your friend. If you believe your frined, than you will think If he finds my wallet, than he will give it to me. But if you don't have belief, than you always worry about your wallet till find your wallet. And also you think that your friend stole your wallet. This is why that belief is important. If you don't have, then he can't be your good friend.
Second, good friend can help you when you need help. There are many happenings in your life. And you must have difficult situations in your life. In this case, only family and good friends will help you. And also you have to help your good friends too. So I think that this friend is your good friend who help you when you are in very hard situation.
Last, good friend have a good attitude. I think this is very imoprotant. If he don't have a good attitude, you will easily angry to him. He can not respect other. So he will not listen well your words. Because of them you will fight with him a lot. It is not friend anymore. So good friend must have a good attitude.
I think friend is most valuable things in your life. They can help you in hard situations. And they give energy to you. You will be happy if you have many good friends. So I recommend to you, that made many good friend. Thank you for reading."	3	2.5	2.5	8
1935	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"We meet many people as we live. Sometimes, when we meet bad friends or people, we feel bad. However, by a good friend, we can get a meaning of our life and enjoyment. I think friends are very important during our life. Among them, I think the qualities of a good friend are cheer and help. 
First, cheer is very important. As my friend has sympathy when I am sad or in a bad situation and is glad together when I am happy, this makes me more happy. For example, when I took a pass message from Kaist, some friends were jealous to me and they said to me that 'I don't know why you pass'. I felt very bad, then. However, my best friends celebrated me and I was happier.  Like this, cheer from my good friends makes me happier and feel better. 
Second, help is the quality of a good friend. By giving someone a hand, the bond can be stronger. When I was in trouble about solving math problems, some friends didn't let me know it. They only thought themselves. But, my good friends tried to have me understand problems. In this situation, I felt importance of good friends. Whenever I was in some troubles, they gave me a hand. So, I also help them sometimes. Through some helps each other, bond between friends is stronger and we can have strong beliefs. 
To sum up, in my opinion, the qualities of good friends are cheer and help each other. Because, in our life, we met various people, I think making good friends are important not to get bad hurts from people. I want you to think of importance and qualities of good friends. Thank you."	3	3.5	3	9.5
1936	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Maybe, People have lots of standard to divide a friend to a good friend and a not good friend.  For me,  I have two standards and I regard those things to be one of the qualities of a good friend.
 First of all,  A good friend can share their own mind.
We can do lots of activities with a  good friend. In that activity, we feel fun and happy and also talk a lot each other. I think conversation with friend can improve the relationship and also, conversation can be improved by a sharing own our mind. So, sharing own mind can be one of the qualities of a good friend.
 Second, A good friend doesn't tell my private story to other people.
While becoming a good friend, we may tell our private story. As listening careful other's story, it is important to protect other private story. There are maybe some reasons that I told a private story to friend. The listener should just listen carefully and shares the friend's mind. When the private story remains in private it may improve our friendship.
 With a good friend, we can improve our friendship. And I think a good friend can sharing mind , protect secrets. Also, If we apply those things reversely,  I think we can be a good friend to others."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
1937	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In my opinion, the most necessary condition for a good friend is helping each other when we are in trouble and never forgetting each other even though I or he/she make a great  accomplishment and is famous in some fields like science or entertainment and become far apart.
First, There are many expamples about people who abanddoned friends helping them when they are in bad situation after success. They betrayed friends and betrayal is known as the baddest thing that human can do. Someone who are betrayed might be hurted and as a result they may not trust others. This process can damage the entire society because trust is important thing  that society functions very well. Without that, remaining is distrust and because of that, the society may eventually decline.
Second, the distance. It divide people far apart but good friends are still in touch and share how they live or what we did in yesterdays. By doing that, we can relieve ourselves from hard time and earn courage to do our best in our life.
Friendship consists of trust and sharing. And these are the society's fuel. Without fuel, it cannot move."	2	2.5	3	7.5
1938	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I think good friends make me go right way. I want to my friends sometimes correct my faults, and sometimes suggest many ways when I don't make the decision with some problems to make me better person.
 I think good friends should understand each other. I know understanding each other is difficult, but I think this is very important. Sometimes we can make fault because of wrong decision or make trouble between each other, but good friends will think about his thinking. And good friends will understand him why he must have wrong decision, and when he say sorry, good friend will get his sorry and make their friendship stronger. 
 This is selfish too, but I think good friend should make me comfortable or happy. In my case, when I hang out with my best friends, I feel comfortable when we play with anything. From we go to cafe to meet and talk to play game, balling, and billard, I feel just comfortable and happy. I want to make friends who make me feel this feelings. 
 I think this is selfish because I don't have confidence to make my friends go right way, or understand my friends, or make my friends comfortable and happy. But I do my best to be good friend. But the qualities of a good friend is different with individuals. So, I could feel that being good friend is difficult. I thought good friend that correct with qualities above doesn't live. So, I think my good friends are just my best friends. I love my friends and eager that our friendship goes until we die."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
1939	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   I thought about three qualities of a good friend. These are honesty, sharing, and competition.
   First, honesty. If a lie or thing that is not honest exists between friends, I don't think that is not a good relationship. I believe 'trust' is most important thing to be a good friend.
   Next, you and your friend should share happiness. I like this Korean sentence. ""It is better that eating together even a bean piece."" The things we can share can be food or other many things. For example, if my friend got a good score for a test, I can give him/her congratulations. It will make me and my friend happier.
   Last thing is competition. Great competition causes you and your friend's improvement. Good friend doesn't give just help. Competiton with good friend will make everyone better people."	2	2	2.5	6.5
1940	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I think that qualities of a good friend are faith, common hobbies and agreement.
First, faith is important part to be a good friend. Sharing thinking with friends is neccesary. Most of people have secret and problem. I consider that sharing secret and problem is able to share between good friends. Sharing secret and problem can help people to feel free. This action can be appeared when there is a faith. So, I think faith is important part to be a good friend. If there is no faith, they will not share secret and problem.
Second, having common hobbies is necessary to be a good friend. Between friends, they often communicate about various themes. Common hobbies need to have endless communication. If there are common hobbies between friends, they will not stop communication because they have a lot of subsect to talk. Thus, I consider having common hobbies between friends is the quality of a good friend.
Third,  agreement is important to be a good friend. Between friends, they share their opinions. In this situation, I think good friends listen and agree friend's opinion. I think agreement is necessary to good relationship because most of people want agreement about their opinion. And people usually have good thinking about friends when their friends agree thier opinion. So I think agreement is required to be a good friend.
Because of these reasons, I think that faith, common hobbies and agreement are qualities of a good friend."	2.5	3	2.5	8
1941	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" We can meet many friends in our lifetime. In them, there are good friends who I want to meet forever, and also there are bad friends who I never want to see again. 
Then, What are the conditions for good friends for me? Some say a good friend is a person who looks like me, from face to personallity. But, Some people don't like each other because they think they look simmilar. 
So, many people think the qualities of a good friend diffrently. However, I think the quallities of a good friend is these. 

First of all, a really good friend must have different thought against me. 
Some people think they are never wrong. But, there are so bunch of people in the Earth. Then there must be a person at least one who thinks different them. If they meet this kind of person, they can't understand each other. 
And If there are people only who they are perfectly correct, the Earth will go to chaos because of war. We have to get flexible thought because it improves our thinking and understanding abilities that need to be creative. 
So we can have flexible thinking while talking friends who have different thought. It means the friend makes me better. 

 Second, a nice friend have to encourage and blame(not too much) me. 
All of us have the time when our self-esteem goes down. While the time, we need to encourage us. But, it's too hard to cheer oursleves. So we need people instead of us who encourage us. 
And if they always encourage me, I think I'm always alright and correct. That's why we need people who blame us. They may help you to find the road of life when you lost it. 
Then we have a friend like that, we can live interactively and properly. 

 For these resons, I think a good friend is a person who has their own thought against me and help and blame me properly.

 We meet many people in our lives. We can meet people at schools, clubs, offices and so on. But we can be lonely without real friends. Because most of people we meet are not friendly that much. Then what are the qualities  of a good friends?
 First, you can share your feelings with them in sincere. I think it is the most important thing of good friends. when you are in sad mood, they can understand your feelings and they will make your feeling better. Also, they can worry about you in sincere.
 Second, they help you without rewards. when you are in danger or you need help immediately, good friends will help you and give you a good advice. These helps and advices can make you solve the problem. In my experience, when I was thinking about my future job, my friends' advice was very helpful. Like this, it is very nice that good friends help each other.
 Last, you can develop with your friends by comparing each other. If you study with your friends, you can learn more faster and easier by discussing some ideas. Of course, extremely comparing with your peers is not good for both of you and your friend. But with your friend you can get will to study more hard and it will help you in long term.
 A lot of people want to make many friends but I think it is more important to make a real good friend who can be with you whole life. "	3	3.5	3	9.5

"  During my life time, I have met a lot of people from every where but the place where I have contacted most people except my family is school. When I get in the new grade, in classroom, most of students are new face to me. There is person whom talking with is so happy although I met him or her first time and I call him or her as a friend. I think that the most important thing of friends is simular thoughts and agenda.

  First of all, I enjoy talking with the people who have same thoughts. When I face the person who has contrast idea with me, it is hard to talking confortablely since I am worring about my words if that psitol ones diffrent idea. However, when I meet the person has same thoughts with me, we can talk without the worries about contents, and it give me good feellings.

  The next reason is that being simular people don't make confilct. In friendship, the more argure, the more bad emotion. If there are many gap of thoughts, it most become arguement and it is harmful to relationship with others. Therefore, it is better to be with people who agree with my opinion.

1944	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"First, I think sports hobby like basketball, soccer or badminton is good for college students.
Because of the Covid 19, we didn't go out side well and stay at home or dormitory.
So, we need to improve our health by doing sports hardly.
In KAIST, there are various sports club that we can enjoy.
Actually, I played basketball since I was middle shcool age.
During the period when I was in basketball club in our middle school, I can feel happy and experience cooperation a lot.
Therefore, I think the sports is proper hobby to college students.
Second, singing a song or playing some instruments is good for enjoying.
Select a song that you want to play, then try hard to sing or play the song.
When you reach a level that can sing or play the song naturally, you'll experience the feeling that you succeed.
In my experience, I've been interested in music.
When I was young, I learned piano hardly.
Plus, I was vocal in band club when I was in high school.
Recently, I often go singing room with my friends and enjoying to sing a song.
After I sing several songs, I feel great.
So, I recommend the hobby which is related to music.
As a result, I think the sports and music activities are proper to college students."	2.5	1.5	2.5	6.5
1945	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Nowadays, college students usually studies or just sit down and look at their phone for daytime, so I think some exercise are really needed. Since they don't have much time to use their body and they sit down most of the time, I want to recommend them gym sports like basketball or squash. People get life energy by exercising and moving their body frequently. There are lots of benefits by trying the gym sports. As an example, no matter of the weather, it is possible to enjoy sports. Also, we don't need lots of things to exercise. Basketball just needs a ball, and squash needs racket and a ball. For the people who are shy and lonely, they can make friends more easily by playing sports like basketball. Obesity is now a serious problem for lots of people, but there can't be a obesity when every people exercises a lot. If people uses energy a lot by moving their body, the fats has to be removed from the body.  And one another good point from the squash is that we can enjoy squash alone, since its play type. I get lazy and feel depressed when I don't do any exercise for some days. It is important for human to move their body rapidly. Human is a creature born to run or walk a lot since we walk in two legs. We definetely have to work out to make our body and our mind healthy. Lying on bed can sometimes be helpful for people who are stressed out, but moving the body a lot can help people get out from the 'burn out' syndrome, and make people feel better sometimes."	3	2.5	2.5	8
1946	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" In these days, COVID - 19 pendemic changed our college life, so I want to write conditions of good hobby that can be enjoyed in COVID - 19  pendemic. Also I will introduce some examples of good hobbies.
 First condition is that we can join that hobby with small groups or just only one person. In South Korea, goverment's guide to avoid spread of COVID - 19 is getting peaple more difficult to meat other peaple, so we must join hobby with few people. Example of sports can be tennis, bedminton, billiard, and etc. I am also unfortunate that we cannot join some bigger scale sports like soccer.
 Second, the hobby must not boder college student's life. In my opnion, student's main goal is focusing on studying (contain lecture, assimnment....) and meat many people in college. Some hobbies can inhabit this goals. In my case, I play computer games with my friends. It is fun and good to get feel better. However, I sometimes use so much times on game on due day of assignment, so I had to do that assignment quickly and I could not satisfied with that result of assignment. 
 For sum, we should enjoy hobbt with few peaple because of COVID -19 and we must control ourselves not to enjoy just only hobby to focus on studying. I think good hobby will get you feel more comportable and give some motivation of your life. "	3	3	2.5	8.5
1947	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" What is your hobby? In my case, watching Korean baseball games. Some of my friends interested in travel, and some of them enjoy cooking. Those are nice hobby, but I think doing multi-play computer games is one of the good hobbies for college students.
 First reason that I think so is we can become familiar with computer while playing computer games. Many students don't have a chance to use computer before enter the college. When you play computer games, you can be familiar with computer such as you can type the keyboard more quickly.
 Next, you can be more friendly with your friends. Almost every multi-play computer games requires communication such as voice or chatting. Thus, there are lots of chance to talk with your friends. While playing computer games, you can be more comfortable with your friends.
 Last reason is you don't have to mind about COVID19. We are living in COVID 19 now. Since it, our lives are blocked in various way. You can't meet your friends more than 4 after 6p.m.. However, there is one way that you can meet your lots of friends. It is computer games. You can't meet your friends in real world, but you can in online.
 Those are the reasons that why playing computer games is nice hobby for college students. Playing computer games provides chance to be more familiar with function of computer such as keyboard typing and macro, gives chance to become more friendly with your friends, and it is wonderful hobby during COVID19."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

"In college, many student have free, so they play with friends in the late night and they drink some beers and sojus every day. But they know it is not good for them. So they have to get a good hobby to change their life. I think the best hobby for college students is singing and listening to music. Music has a lot of powers. It can change your feeling and it can make you relax. My hobby is go to karaoke alone. It is good to erase bad mind and break up my stress. Many people love to go to karaoke, too. Of course not all of them love singing a song, some people like listening songs but they have a common to feel happy. Some music is used to cure people. For example, If you have a lot of angry, doctor gives you some tips like listening to classic music. Since of them, music can helps our college life more happy and more relax. So I think singing and listening to music are best hobby for college students."	2.5	2	2	6.5

It will make people spend free time better and happier, also make people have vision for their dream related to hobby. Good hobby can change our life more beautiful, and healther. And for student in people, what can be the good hobby? I think it will be books and sports. They can help our life better, healther, clearer.
In books' case, reading books for free time help us make the larger sight for see the world, make better filter for adapt from the see of information. Good books can make good filter and make us choose better information from world. And books can make non-real experience, it will give you to get the memory that you don't be ever, and make solution for problem you will be in future. It can help you when you fall in little hole of life line. This two reason will make our life better and healther.

1950	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  I think jogging is a good hobby for college student. And I will talk about why jogging is good for college student.
  First, jogging is chance to go outside. Today, because of Covid-19, it is not easy to outside. And almost people stay at home or dorm. Although, many colleges have non face-to-face lectures so college students that don't go outside are increase. But it is very harmful for our health. So we should jogging. If we have a hobby jogging, we can find the reason that we sholud go outside. Also, jogging is doing at open place, not close place so it is safe for the Covid-19.
  Second, jogging is good for our health. If we jog everyday, we can improve our stemina. Stemina is basic for all exercise and our life.  Also, we can prevent many problems with our body. And we can get fresh air with jogging. Fresh air is good to  our healt and our brain's health too. So, jogging is very good hobby.
  Lastly, jogging is very easy and simple. Almost exercise need some things. For example, balls, racket, timer, ect. But jogging need nothing execpt thin clothes and light shoes. It is very good for college students who have less money. Also, we can jog anywhere like street, playground, and yard. If there are ground, we can jog on there. And jogging is sports that play alone. So it is easy to planning and make goals.
  Jogging makes chance to go outside with Covid-19, it is good for our health, it can improve our stemina, it is very simple exercise and we can jog anywhere and any thime. So I think jogging is good hobby for college student."	3	3.5	2.5	9
1951	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are many good hobbies for college students! But I will choose only one hobby and explain the reasons why it is good.

I think playing sports is the best hobby for college students. There are 2 reason why it is good.

First, there is less chance to exercise if you don't have sports for your hobby.
For most college students , they have less chance to exercise.
They can't take a PE class as they did on the highschool. And even if they take, that PE class would teach us about 'exercising' not 'enjoying sports'.
So if you join a sports club or learn sports on sports class, you can enjoy sports and it makes you healthier!

Second, playing sports is fun!
Everyone knows that exercising is good for our health. Many people had decided to lose their weight but failed.
I think it's because many people treat exercising as their homework. (Many people hate to exercise.) If they enjoying exercising, they could lose their weight.
Playing sports is more close to playing game than doing homeworks. So people can easily enjoy playing sports because playing sports is fun.

So I think playing sports is the best hobby not only for college students but also for everyone."	2	1.5	2.5	6
1952	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Lots of college students are studying hard in their each major. In Korea, college students have more time for their hobbies than high school students, middle school students, even elementary students. When we look at KAIST's clubs there are various clubs such as soccer club, badminton club, singing club. And many students in KAIST join their own clubs and enjoy their own hobbies. There are many hobbies college students can enjoy. In my opnion, fitness is a good hobby for college students among uncountable hobbies. 
First, fitness can make their bodies healthy. Korean students' amout of exercising is almost the lowest in the world. They studied very hard since they had gone to elementary school for going university. In  Korean society, P.E class isn't important class. So, P.E class is only for an hour in a week or two hours in a week. It's very short time thar students can get healthy bodies. Because of these thinking, Korean students are dangerous from obesity. But college students who have lots of time for exercise can recover their bodies healthy with fitness. 
Next, fitness doesn't spend lots of time and effort. When we play soccer it takes more than 90 minutes, and we need soccer shoes, soccer ball the most important thing is stadium. However, fitness doesn't need these things. Of course, there are many different types of fitness but you can do this with only your body. According to my health trainer it's difficult to work out over an hour. Many students also can reduce their waste time through fitness.
In conclusion, many college students in Korea didn't have much time for exercise in their school life. So, i think fitness is good hobby for the students. Because fitness can make their bodies health and reduce their waste time and money. I hope many students in KAIST go to the gym and do fitness for their health and talk about how was it each other happily. "	4	4	4	12
1953	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think good hobby for college students is exercising and playing sports. 
Exercise is so important component in our life. We need to be health whatever we do or want to do even we want to play with other people, and exercise is so good thing that can make us more health. However, doing exercise can be not easy because of following reason. Exercise help us to live more health but it makes us fatigue right after doing that, so some people do not want to start it. That reason make people who exercise regularly great. Sure, the fact that those people are great people is absolutely correct. Saying honestly, these people will achieve their goal thanks to their habit that they do something regularly. However, I will say that anyone can become those people. Everyday do exercise even if it's just small, easy one and once that becomes your habit, you will need not much determinant to do exercise.
Exercise can give us not just only health but also improvement of own personality. Doing hard exercise continuously, we can improve tolerance and become more strong for external damage; the fact that damage is physical or mental is not matter. We can also get stand that we do not give up easily. Achieving their own small goal while exercising, they can feel pleasure of achievement and it makes them not give up easily.
Lastly, exercise can improve our relationship between other people. Exercising with other people, we get new friends and relationship between them can be more great. Moreover, exercising or playing sports with friends, we can improve relationship with friends and cooperation abilities."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
1954	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"For many people, college is the last step toward the society. The work-life-balance is emphasized nowadays, but actual pressure in mind and fatigue didn't let job workers to do their hobbies well. So, I think college is the last time to experience and challenge various hobbies. Therefore, choosing which hobby to do is very important. I think sports or arts is good hobbies for college student; actually KAIST student. Give me some excuse because I didn't experience other non-industrial college.
First reason is that sports and arts is not deeply related with their majority. Escape from their mind-blowing study or research, they can move their body and refresh their mind with hobbies. It also cost very small, so it is easy to access and thanks for the youtube, they can learn about it freely! But, I didn't recommend some hobbies that cost a lot. They need to enjoy their hobbies to relax, but if economical pressure was gained because of the hobby, they lost more than they gain. Well, if they really enjoy and truly desire those expensive hobbies, I don't want to tell them to not to. I just recommend.
Secondly, most of Industrial college student usually don't move. Most of studies and lecture in industrial college don't demand a lot of action. Just sit infront of the table and study math, physics, make and so on. So, when they have a hobby about sports and arts, they need to move to buy some gadgets, do that sports, go to museum kind of things. I think those hobbies increase people's moving and walking, finally they can get healthy and become mindly rich.
With those reasons, I think sports and arts are good hobbies for college students. Except those reasons, there are several other reasons; like learning sports and arts related humanity and so on. Actually, I have a lot of indoor hobbies. Thanks for this writing prompts, maybe I'll try to get some outdoor hobbies."	3.5	3	3	9.5
1955	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  In my opinion, good hobby for college students is  a self-growing materials. For example, exercising, playing piano, and even playing games. You can agree with follwing reasons.
  First, collage students are steps that are just before live social alone. Being an adult is difficult mission. We meet new people, associated in new sytem, and have to decide whole our life in collage. If we don't prepare our living strategys and living base, It could be hard to live after graduation.
  Second, Just having  deep-interesting hobby is good to our living. As I proposed above ""playing games"" for example, it can be self-growing material. I'm not saying about just playing games. It must be professional. In my case, I analyse after the game about winning or losing reasons. Then, I set a ""concept to win"" and cirtify by myself. It leads me to feel happy because of achievements, and also get a lot of talking topics with my friends. To sum up, It makes us to be a professional person.
  Finally, we can be attractive person. We all attracts to ""Hard-doing person"". It is obvious. Therefore, we can advantage with meeting new person. It can affect to all our living to right direction.
  We've talk about why having self-growing hobby is important. However, keep in mind. The fundamental thing is doing hard with your passion!"	2.5	3	2	7.5
1956	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I suggest that a good hobby for college students should be everything if it gives them developments, eliminates their stress well, and not be unhealthy. Well-known examples of those hobbies are exercising, playing games, or shopping. However, the hobbies I suggest include even discussing something, proving math problems or coding websites, if the students are not stressed with it which may not that related with their assignments or lectures. Let me explain why I set three conditions.

First of all, a good hobby should lead the students good way for their future. Hobby is something you do just you like it. However, if the hobby gives students bad effects more than good effects, it shadows their eyes. Is it a good hobby that Shadows their future vision? No, it would make them not be able to do well and settle in their future job.

Secondly, college students get much of stress in their studying and interactions, so need the outlet. This outlet will be used sustainably after graduating their college. Many medical paper proves that proper balancing of stress gives people positive effects. It can protect them from the seducing things and preserve their ability of memorizing.

Last reason, good hobby should give self-love mind for the college students. Not a Narssicism. The mind loving themselves will be produced with healthy mind. Good hobbies can help for having a healthy mind. The hobbies should be their good life-friends.

The three conditions I gave are satisfying above reasons I think, isn't it? Developing students' ability, works as an outlet of stress, and make them healthier. Students will be helped by their hobbies. So, why don't you make your own good hobby?"	4	3	3	10
1957	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"It has very variable opinion that what is a good hobby for college students. However, in my opinion, exercise is the best hobby for university students for some reasons.
To begin with, exercise helps to prevent our ill. To be specific, we will not get pain for weakness. Otherwise, We cna not get healthy body and we will get some ill. For example, last  spring semester, I have some pain in my back. So my friends encourage to enroll gym. After that happen, my pain is slowly gone for summer. This is why exercise is very important to college students. 
Second, We can get closer with other people who do not know us before by exercise. For instance, in summer semester, I did climbing regularly in sport complex, in kaist. At frist time, I hang out with few of my friends. But one day, sophomore and sinear students teach climbing to me . After that, I and they get closer and closer because of climbing, exercise! For that reasons, I highly recommend college students to do exercise.
Like above, I am strongly thinking that exercise is very nice hobby for college students. And I really want every students to do exercise for that reasons."	3.5	3.5	3	10
1958	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" In college, students have to find what they will do. Also, student can do which they want to do. In other word, college student have freedom than high school students. Than , what is a good hobby for college student? There are many choices about this question. But, I think travel abroad is a good hobby for college students. There are several reasons why I think like that.
 First, we can get many things from travel abroad. For example, it could be knowledge about the culture, foreign friends and memories. It's hard to get foreign friends in hometown. You can get knowledge about other countries by internet, books, but I think travel is easy to get more knowledge and strongly memory in  your head than other things. And some experience just you can get other countries, not your country. Region parties, foods are the example about that.
 Second, I think it would be last time to travel easyly. You can have a wonder about why people should travel when they are college students. It is true that we can travel abroad when our ages is 50. But, I want to say it's is hard to go. Because, when we are working at office, it is pretty hard to have a vacation. In addition, we are young. So, your health is very good. Travel needs good health. Because of this, I think college students is good time to travel!
 Today, I talked about what is a good hobby for college students. And my answer is travel abroad. The first reason is we can get many things from travel abroad. Next reason is when we are in college would be last time to travel easyly. I'm so sad because we aren't easy to travel because of COVID-19 situation. I hope this situation end soon and when the situation is done, I strongly recommend you travel abroad. "	4	3.5	3.5	11
1959	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  As our society becomes more and more competitive, college students struggle to get a good credit at each of their lectures. Studying hard, students get enormous amount of stress, and many of them start to consider how they can release their stress in appropriate ways. Having a good hobby becomes a thing for students to consider as well as studying hard. After considering merits and demerits of the hobbies that students usually do, I think riding a bicycle is a perfect hobby for college students.

  First of all, students can fulfill the time that they should spend working out to maintain their health. Many college students do not enjoy playing sports and have no time to exercise during the semester. When they wake in the morning, they should go and take lectures until about 4 in the afternoon. After all the lectures end, they have to do the assignments. If a student want to get a good grade in particular subject, he or she will spend more time on that. Doing such things, they have no time to go to a gym and do some workout. Even if they have some spare time, they want to spend it reducing their stress; therefore they finally do not exerciese. However when the students consider an exercise, in particular, riding a bicycle as a hobby and method to releave stress, they can become not only mentally, but also physically healthy. To take my own example, I did not actually enjoy playing sports. When I have some leisure time, it was common for me to use that time watching some videos on YouTube or doing some no-brainer tasks on my bed. As the result, I became more and more fat and I felt that I was becoming unhealthy. After that I start to go out and ride a bicycle after I had done all the tasks that I had to do. Since then, I was able to be in shape and get some energy to move on to the next day. Riding a bicycle does help us to maintain our health.

  In addition, bicycle is not a heavy exercise, so students can enjoy it easily. When we go to gym and do some exercise with the insruments in their, we feel pain in our musle, and have trouble living the next day. Also when we play a field sport such as baseball or soccer, it need to much energy so after playing such, we become so exhausted. If the hobby makes students suffer from a pain or too exhausted, students have trouble doing assignments or studying for the exam. This finally affect to the students negatively. However, unlike those, riding a bicycle is good to enjoy and is a appropriate exercise for college students. When we ride a bike, we can do both aerobic and muscular exercise both in moderate amount. For instance, one of my friends , Kim loved playing soccer with friends. Whenever he have some time to play it, he was always in a soccer field. I thought that it was very good to have a field sport that one can do as a hobby. However, I realize that he was concerning about it talking with him. He said that he do enjoy playing it but everytime he played, he became too exhausted so he could not do the assignment on time. I recommended him to ride a bicycle with me instead of playing soccer. Now, he is very satisfying at riding a bicycle, because he can do exercise and not become too tired. Like this, student can enjoy bicycle easily.

  For these reasons, I think that riding a bicycle is the best hobby for the college students. Riding a bicycle, students can be in shape but not beoming too tired so it does not negativelly affect to their routine of studying."	5	5	5	15
1960	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In these days, COVID - 19 pendemic changed our college life, so I want to write conditions of good hobby that can be enjoyed in COVID - 19  pendemic. Also I will introduce some examples of good hobbies.
 First condition is that we can join that hobby with small groups or just only one person. In South Korea, goverment's guide to avoid spread of COVID - 19 is getting peaple more difficult to meat other peaple, so we must join hobby with few people. Example of sports can be tennis, bedminton, billiard, and etc. I am also unfortunate that we cannot join some bigger scale sports like soccer.
 Second, the hobby must not boder college student's life. In my opnion, student's main goal is focusing on studying (contain lecture, assimnment....) and meat many people in college. Some hobbies can inhabit this goals. In my case, I play computer games with my friends. It is fun and good to get feel better. However, I sometimes use so much times on game on due day of assignment, so I had to do that assignment quickly and I could not satisfied with that result of assignment. 
 For sum, we should enjoy hobbt with few peaple because of COVID -19 and we must control ourselves not to enjoy just only hobby to focus on studying. I think good hobby will get you feel more comportable and give some motivation of your life. "	3	3	2.5	8.5
1961	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are many hobbies in the world, but  I think specifically it is a good hobby for college students  to watch internet news or movies. there are two reasons for that opinion.
First, We can get much information about our career or our life from news and movies. For example, I  could get many information about COVID through  news, and it helped me to decide whether get in dorm is good or not.  These days, I can see many things about problems that I will suffer  in future like getting job problem, buying own house problem and new laws about colleges. It would  be very beneficial, because college student(in Korea , MZ generation ) should react immediately  against rapid chage of environment and laws for getting jobs.    
Second, We can also get useful tips in movies. For example, I could get  'My lifetime is limited and very short,  so  I have to spend my every day  doing  meaningful things. ' watching korean movie named'dont' cross  that  river, my precious' . And many SF movies like 'interstella' or 'starwars' gave me  small motivation to be a physicist. I think almost every college student have some movies they cannot forget easily for some different reasons,  And these movies will give them many useful effect to you dream, and your thought. And also it takes just a few hours to watch movies, so it's effect on your study time would be very small than other hobbies like playing online game and so on.  But its effect on your life would be much more meaningful than other things.
To sum up, watching news or movies is very useful hobby to college student, because they can make us to prepare for future by giving useful informations, and also they can give us tips for life. For these two reasons I think news and movies are very good things to watch in college student's free time. Let's watch news or movies not to waste our free time!

1962	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Many college student have their own hobbies. They enjoy them as club member, or do by thierselves. Some people say studying is most important thing for student but interests is valuable for their life, too. Also, several of them can make them study well. they can release strees, concentrate more, and motivate themselves from  holding hobby.
 In my opinion, sports is the best hobby for college students. First of all, they can exercise ordinarily from the interests. It is good for their mental and physical health. Especially, physical strength is one of the most important thing to study long time healthily.  Furthermore, many psychiatrist say moving body is contribute to mental health and it can make mind  depression better. Next, people can care strees from enjoying sports. It is best way for  relieve it from learning  with sitting in chair and it's significant because keeping strees long time can make many mind problem and bad efficiency.
 enjoying sports as hobby can gives many  strengths to students. "	3	3	3	9
1963	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In my opinion, good hobby for college student is traveling. There are several reason that I think traveling is good hobby.
First of all, traveling can gives them a lot of knowledge that can't learn from books or internet. They could learn other countries nature, culture, etc. Especially, it is very helpful to visit other countries university or museum. Some people think this is loosing time for college students, but not for me. By visiting those places, it can help college studnets to sellect their jobs or dreams.
Second, it is good for releasing stress. Some students in college could satisfy at life in college in anyway. But lots of student in college get amount of stress by difficult for studying , personal relationship, etc. According to one  article,  most students release these stress by drinking alcohol or playing games. But these way cannot solve  problem(most online games, people usually get more stress). Also it is not good for health. But, traveling can solve this problem very well. By using our vacation, we can get free for where to sleep, what to eat, where to go! Stress is usually came from pressure from surround. So traveling let us to release stress because there are nothing can get pressure to you.
Thrid, it could be helpful for planning. Since highschool student came to college, it is hard to them for making plan or schedule and clear it. Unlike college, highschool have 'school's schedule' which is 'all student's schedule'. One more reason that scheduling is hard is it is not what they want. If we play online gmaes, we easily do log-in every day and do homework in game. What I want to say is this, traveling is people usually likes, this factor can college student to schedule travel and successfully clear the plan.
For these reasons, I think traveling is good  hobby for college studnets. And let me say one more sentence! Nowdays, because of COVID-19, it is hard to travel other countries. So, it there is a chance for traveling without this situation, I recommand you to travel right away!"	4	4	3.5	11.5
1964	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Visiting a new country, Japan.
For almost people, visiting a foreign country is maybe happy. There are so many purpose to visit other country, but this time I want to say traveling. In my case, I visited many countries. For example, U.S.A twice, Vietnam and Israel. Visiting new country is very happy for me because I can get new experiences, so I want to visit Japan for two weeks and there are more reasons. I will add three specific reasons why I want to visit Japan.
First of all, Japan is closest country to Korea. So, flight fee can be lower than another country. Also, I can go Japan in two ways, airplane and ship. In case of very far country like U.S.A, I can use only airplane. I consider not only trasportation part, but also culture. Because Korea and Japan are in same cultural area, food and life style is almost similar. So i can easily adapt in Japan and less difficulties to eating food. But, I want to find some differences between two country. It will be also fun part.
 The best important part why I want to visit Japan is I am very interested in Japanese culture. I like japanese food, one of my dream is go to Japan and eat many kind of japanese sushi. Also, I like japanese animation. I want to know background of animation and buy some animation goods. In addition, I want to look and feel japanese daily life, and find differences between my life.
 Finally, sea level is going higher and higher so maybe I can't go to Japan in few years ago. Japan is kind of land, so Japan is influenced by the height of sea. Even some area is flooded. If global warming becomes faster and the sea level rises faster, it will be hard to enjoy the whole Japan. I want to visit Japan, the country I'm most interested in, and enjoy the whole thing like visiting everywhere in Japan before flooding.
 To sum up, I want to visit Japan because it is closest country to Korea, I like japanes culture and food and I want to enjoy whole Japan before some area's flooding. In Korea, we can also enjoy japanese culture and food, but it will be not enough to enjoy the whole thing. If there are somebody who is interested in Japan, how about recommend visiting Japan and having some nice experience?"	3	2.5	2.5	8
1965	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Travel to Spain
       Since the Covid-19, we do not go to abroad for a long time. There are many countries all around the worold and they all have their own tour's attractions. We can see and learn about other countries with TV but it is more exciting when we go there. In Asia, there are many great countries to travel such as Japan and China but I want to travel Europe. If I have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks, I will go to Spain for big three reasons.
     First of all, I am interested in Spainese the language of Spain. When I see the netflex, there are many spainese drame so that I want to learn spainese. I take spainese class in KAIST and I learn about communication. During the class, I am interested in Spainese so I want to learn more about this. I think the best way to develope Spainese skills is go to Spain and talk with Spainish. Although I only know the greeting and asking the time, I want to go and get more about Spainese.
     Simially to Spainese, In Spain, there is big soccer league called Lalega. Because I am interested in soccer, I know about the Lalega. Although Messi  and Ronaldo went to other league, there are many big clubs and world class players. There are many big leagues, but I like Lalega the most because of their pass play.  For the same reason, almost people who like soccer want to see the soccer game in Spain and it's their dream.  After I love soccer, I hope to see the soccer game in other countries when I earn money.
     Finally, there are many artistic tour attractions. In art class, I learned about Spain art such as godic architectures. I want to see the church in Spain, L.S.F and feel the culture. Also, in Spain, there are many famous clubs such as IVIZA. Next year, I become the adult, so I want to enjoy the club with dance and music. Like these tour attractions attempt me.

  Many people wants to travel abroad if they have chance. Especially because of Covid 19 people cannot travel freely, so they wants to travel more. I am the one of the person who wants to travel. There are many good countries such as Japan, USA, England. However, if I have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks, I will visit Germany for three reasons.
  First of all, there are some people who can speak English. In abroad, emergency situation can occur. In emergency situation, conversation is very important because I can explain what happens and what I need. It would be very embarrasing, if I cannot talk with others in those situations. Moreover, it would be very conveneient in daily life if I can talk with others. I can also meet foreign friends have nice conversation. It will let me have special memory. 
  Another advantage of visiting Germany is that I can go to other countries in Europe by train. I want to experience many countries because I don't have many chance to go Europe. I can eat foods in diverse countries and visit places with beautiful sight. I can also experience tradition of each countries and see famous structures. 
  In addtion to speaking English and visiting other countries, I want to visit Germany since Germany is famous for preserving environment. There is a well-known eco-friendly city, Frizenbrook(?) where people use eco-friendly energy. The city also have eco-friendly laws, and it works by participation of citizens. I know the city  due to my assignment, and I am very interested about the city. I want to visit the city, and see how the city looks like.

    How many country have you ever been before and which country was best for you? I have never been abroad except the U.S.A, so there are many countries that I want to visit. For example, I want to visit the U.K, France, Spain because I like to watch eropean football matchs. However, the country I want to visit most is Japan. Three reasons why I want to visit Japan is comic books, delicious foods and distance from Korea.  
   First, I am a big fan of Japaneese comic books. Japan has many great comics like 'Naruto' or 'One Piece'. I want to buy some goods of them and feel the originaliy of Japan.
    In addition to comic books, there are a lot of delicious foods in Japan. Although Korean foods are my favorite, sometimes I wish eat something else because they are very spicy. Japaneese foods are not spicy, so they make me comfortable after having it. It will be wonderful if I have salmon sushi in Japan.
    The third reason why I want to visit Japan is that it is very close to Korea. When I visited the U.S.A, I had to stay at the airplane for 14 hours and I was very boring during that time. However, visiting Japan from Korea takes 1-2 hours by airplane and there are also no time difference between Korea and Japan.
    In conclusion, I want to visit Japan because there are many goods of comic books, delicious foods, and it is very close to Korea. Because of these advantages, it will be great if you visit Japan. Why do not you visit Japan and enjoy these benefits?"	3.5	4	4	11.5
1968	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Why U.K is most hottest  tourist attraction for me in the world
   Most of people have a dream of touring all over the world. Some of those choose America to see beautiful scenery and advanced culture of US or choose Asia to experience ancient ruins. Of course, Europe is one of the continent  that many of the  tourist want to visit. there are good scenery  and ruince in greece, and there are lots of palace in France and Italy. Although weather of the U.k is not good, in my opinion Unitied Kingdom is the best attraction for me in aspect of Sport, historical and language reason.
    First,  watching Premier League in real stadium is one of  my bucket list in my life. I am a huge fan of PL, especially Manchester United. There are lots of soccer league all over the Europe, but England league is the best in aspect of  quallity of manager and players, and amount of money is biggest. Most of all, when I saw  game on TV, I always envy atmosphere by cheering their players in stadium. Then, I made a dream to go to Old Trafford and other stadium to feel those feeling.
    Consequently, the culture of the United Kingdom is quite attractive.  England hve a great power in the world since 11st century. Because of it. they have a lots of attractions like Birmingham palace, and a clock tower. Also, there ar huge amount of ruins and historical things that I want to visit. Further more, geographical characteristics of  Country is also interesting. There are 4 country in U.K, and those 4 countries have a different lifestyle. So these are one of the reason that I want to visit U.K
     Finally, the langauge is friendly to me. I can speak Korean, English, and Chineese. I prefer freestyle travel than travel with guide. But I can speak Chineese only little bit, so It is quite hard  to visit countries those use Chineese. But Country which located in North-West in Europe speaks English. Athough, there are few differences in American English,  but It is the great advantage that they are simmiliar.
     In short, United Kingdom has a great their own soccer league, and cultural attractions and friendly language for English users. Attractive cultural characteristics and laguage issue is huge criteria that you choose your travel place. If you love soccer,  want to visit various culture attraction, and want to speak fluently, why don't you travel to United Kingdom?"	5	4.5	4.5	14
1969	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"The Reasons That I Like to Visit America

               These days, many travelers have not visited foreign countries because of Covid 19. In my case, I like to travel somewhere with my families or friends. If Covid 19 would be disappeared, I wish I have the opportunity to go to a foreign country. Although all of the countries are wonderful, I believe that I want to visit America for three reasons.
               First of all, America is one of the greatest countries that have beautiful places in the world. I know that America has popular places like Grand Canyon and Status of Liberty. I want to visit all of them, and I will take lots of pictures. When I was 17, I vistited America with my high school friends. I traveled east of America, but I did not happy about I did not visit west of America. Therefore, I especially want to visit west of America.
               Second, I can learn a lot of academic things from America. There are a lot of famous universities like Harvard and Cambridge.  I am a student of KAIST, and I will study and research academy widely. Though Korea has a lot of technology, but America has more strong power of technology than Korea. If I go to America and learn about that, I can develop my technology skills and grow up.
               Finally,  I want to make experiences that communicate with foreigners to use English. I learn English when I was in elementary school. However, I did not have the opportunity to communicate with English. It has the limits that I only study in Korea. I heard that I can upgrade my English speaking skills if I talk with foriegners many times. Becuase I hope I want to be a global leader, I want to practice English in America.
               America is the country that has a lot of advantages and a things that I have to learn. I want to visit America because I want to feel happiness, learn academy, and practice English. It is difficult to have the opportunity to visit a foreign country becuase of Covid 19, but if it is possible, I am sure that I will go to America first."	5	4.5	4.5	14
1970	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are many countries where is good to travel. If I ask question about where to go to many people, they recommend many countries. However, I believe that visiting United States of America is the best choice.
First reason why I want to visit U.S.A. is about landmarks. There are so many landmarks in U.S.A., like Time Square, Statue of Liberty. I can visit many places and take pictures of them. U.S.A. especially has many landmarks than other countries because of large lands. Therefore, I want to visit U.S.A. and see them.
Not only landmarks are the reason why I want to visit there, but also experiences in U.S.A. is another important reason. There are many kinds of differences in culture part between Korea and other west countries. For example, there are difference between what we eat, how to behave to elder people, whether take off shoes when we enter house.  By traveling west countries, I think I can notice this kinds of difference and allow to know what other countries' people think at certain situation. I believe that U.S.A. is the best country to learn this kinds of experience because I can meet most people in U.S.A..
Final reason I want to visit U.S.A. is about satefy. Although we do not know about it's importance because Korea is one of the best country in social safety, travelers are in danger to expose crimes. They can be stolen wallets, or even threated lifes. In U.S.A., it would be more safe than other countries in Africa or east-south Asia.
In conclusion, I want to visit U.S.A. because of many landmarks, new experiences and social safety. Although other people recommend to travel another country, if you also have time to travel other countries, I strongly recommend to visit U.S.A. and having many fresh experiences."	4	3.5	3.5	11
1971	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are many considering things to choose  a foreign country where i stay for two weeks. Choosing a country which I want to go is important. However I must stay for two weeks in other country, I should consider other things. Considering many things, I think Japan is the most favorite country i would like to go. 
First, Since Korea and Japan  are placed in Asia, there are many similarities between two countries. Especially, foods of each country are very similar. Foods of two countries are usually based on rice or noodle. This rice and noodle are also my main food, so i can adapt Japanese food more easily than other countries. 
So, for two weeks, I think  I can live without food problem. 
Second, Japan is an advanced country in scientific technology.  When I was 14, I visited Japan with my friends and I visited many science and technology places like robot studio. In robot studio, I can experience robot suit  and various sensor easily. This is very interesting experience to me, so I want to experience again. Also, I want to learn about operation of robot in this place. 
Third, Japanese people are kind and clean. There are no garbages which are rolling in the road. 
Japan is similar to Korea, an advanced in scientific technology and clean. I believe that these things make me stay for two weeks more easily. "	3	2.5	3	8.5

"Nowadays, traveling abroad is almost stopped because of Covid-19. Also, many people wish to travel to other country and some people are planning their travel when Covid-19 pandemic gets better. If I have opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks, I would like to visit USA for three reasons; to visit country that I have not traveled yet, to see landmarks in person and to communicate with foreign people.
     First of all, USA is a new country for me. I have some fantasy about the country that I have not go yet, because I had an experience of feeling this when I visited other new country, Hawaii. When I visited Hawaii for the first time, I was very excited that many things such as bus, road, and restaurant were very different from my country. I want to feel this one more time through visiting USA.
     Besides visiting new country, I can see landmarks in person when I visit USA. There are many landmarks in USA that I just saw in the internet or textbook, such as Central Park, Times square, or statue of liberty. Because seeing in media and seeing in person gives different feeling, I want to see in person at least one time.
     To communicate with foreign people is third reason that I want to visit USA. I am learning English for 13 years, but my pronounciation is not good because I learned English in Korea. Two weeks are enough to be friends and talk with foreign people. If I practice talking with american, my pronounciation will be better and vocabulary that I use will be much wider. Also, if I am lucky, they can be friends even I go back to Korea.
     To sum up, I want to visit USA for two weeks because I want to visit new country, see landmarks in real, and talk with foreign people. It is important to get a lot of good experience through visiting foreign country, such as USA, as I explained. If you have an opportunity to travel abroad after Covid-19, I recommend you to visit USA and have a lot of experience."	4.5	4.5	4	13

Grand Canyon is one of the best scenery where I have been. I get feel magnificent when I see Grand Canyon. I recommend you to visit Grand Canyon when you visit in USA.
Finally, have great science laboratory. USA is one of the best country that advanced in science. It is no exaggeration to say that they are leading the world science. Visiting that country's laboratory is glory for me.

Thanks to developing transportation skills, we now can travel all around the world whenever we want. Since it is conveninent to go with advanced technology, traveling has been one of hobbies of people. Despite of this situation, some people would not prefer visiting England for trip because of its unpredictabel weather or distance. However, I am in favor of visiting England for two reasons.
First, England is the country that soccer was born. Soccer is the most famous sports with no doubt. In this situation, England has the biggest leauge, which is called premier leauge. In the case of my senior of high school, he was affected by England's soccer cultures. Since traveling England, he had been watching various soccer games.
Not only can we meet various soccer institution, but we can learn English and history effectevly. English is the common language in the world. For example, it is hard to find non-English applications or sites. Because England uses it, we are likely to learn various expressions that native speaker uses. Besides, England had affected all around the world in history. Due to that facts, we easily watch world's masterpieces and cultures.
To sum up, visting England may not be easy and inconvenient in contrast with one's country, but it has certain advantages. For the most part, we can meet various cultures in country that ruled lots of other countries once. After traveling, we can not only find own hobby but als learn lots of things such as language.

  Do you have a specific coutry when the opportunity to travel foreign country for two weeks? People may have each own coutry that they want to visit for two weeks for each own reason. Although I have never travel foreign country so it may be made of my misunderstanding about the country, I have one country which I really admire to visit for a long time: Spain.
  The first reason I want to visit Spain is that Spain is the country which have my precious memory with my friend Jian. Jian is my bestfriend who I get along with from middle school and I really cherish her. When I graduated middle school, she give me some presents, and one of them is map of capital of Spain. She said that she think the mood of Spain is alike with me and recommend to visit. At that point, I decided to have a trip to Spain later. In other word, Spain is the place that my memory is included so I want to visit.
  The another reason I want to visit Spain is that I want to see the buildings of Gaudi. I learned the art product of Gaudi in middle school English class. From that class, I have known the beautifulness of the buildings of Gaudi. Especially his buildings' design is from nature point such as round line and outstanding texture, and I want to see them for my eyes. Additionally, the famous building La sagrada Familia which is not finished to construct is the one of the buildings I want to meet, too. 
  In addition to memory and Gaudi's buildings, I admire to visit Spain because of its climate. Because I perosnally really hate the humid climate such as Korean summer, so I always want to visit some countries whoose climate is not humid and which have fresh and comfortable climate. If I feel the country's fresh climate, that exprerience will be the best point of my life. Because I have never been there, the thought that the country's climate will be nice for me can be misunderstanding. But I think its climate is good for me now, and want to visit Spain for that reason.
  To sum up, the country that I want to visit for two weeks for three reasons: memory with my friend, buildings of Gaudi, and its climate. Though It is difficult to travel foreign coutry because of the disaster from covid 19 virus, I hope everyone can enjoy their own journey to each own admiring country."	4	4	3.5	11.5
1977	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Traveling to other countries is one of special opportunities in our life. Other countries have different life styles, cultures, and people from our country and we can make many experiences by visiting foreign countries. People have many opinions about visiting foreign country. For example, some people want to visit country where they can enjoy cultures or some people want country that they can rest. In my opinion, I want to visit Japan if i have a opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. In this essay, I want to explain why I want to visit Japan for two weeks with three reasons.
     First of all, Japan have long territory, it have variety of cultures by the place. The territory of Japan is vertically long, so there are variety of cultures in Japan. We can enjoy the culture related to winter if we go to the north part of Japan and enjoy the culture related to summer by going to the south part. Although countries have big territory such as USA, China also have variety of cultures, we are hard to enjoy all of the cultures in two weeks because the territories are too big. However, Japan have territory that we can travel all part in two weeks, so I chose Japan due to the ratio of territory to variety of cultures.
     Not only about the variety of cultures, the transportation system of Japan is well-built. The contents of country are useless if we hard to arrive the place to enjoy. In that point, people visiting Japan can go to almost whole place by using good transportation system. For example, I visited Japan last year and I could use the transportation system without learning Japan language. The transportation system provided English and Hangeul to easily use. Moreover, the transportation system built by the train, taxi, and bus was fully enough to travel all part of Japan.
     Finally,  in addition to the good transportation system, Japan is a country that we can enjoy without hard studying of the own cultures. Some countries like India and China have cultures that we should study about such as Islam cultures. However, almost all of cultures in Japan don't need a special studies to enjoy them or just need simple prepare items. Due to this point, we can easily enjoy the Japan cultures.
     To sum up, I want to visit Japan due to the variety of cultures, good transportation system, easy cultures. How about making special experience by visiting Japan for two weeks? I specially recommend that we can fully enjoy the Japan with traveling."	5	4.5	4	13.5

"Did you have ever visit Spain the one of the country? I want to visit Spain if I have the opportunity to visit a foregin country for two weeks. Although many people in korea usually watch football games in England, I love watch Spain’s football games. So, I want to travel Spain’s cities and watch football games in Spain.
       First, I love  watching the foreign  football games espacially, I love Spain’s game. My favorite football player is Messi the one of world class player in the world and he played and lived  almost his  whole player's life in Spain. Therefore, I watched the other matches and I get some curious about the country. I hope that I feel the exciting area’s atmosphere and see the player in person. As going to watch football match is my bukect list,  I want to visti their and watch the game in person!
      The second reason I don’t know well about Spain culture , famous place, and their history. I just know the spain for the football games so, I want to know their culture more specific. I have interesting Spain but, it is hard to learn and understand their history in Korea. While I can learn their culture and history for books or other media but, I hope to experience their culture and travel their cities in person. I think that understanding other culture for words such as books and visit the place and see them has a lot of differences. 
      Finally, I like their weather that it is shinny alomst day but not too hot to travel and take a rest. I know that it is very shinny and rarely raining day. As the weather where I visit is very important for me to travel and visit mant places, Spain’s weather is nice to me. Also, I love the travel take a lots of time and get rest to remove my stress  in beautiful veiw so Spain’s islands are perfert to me. 
     To sum up, I want to visit Spain and their island to watch football match get to rest. It is interesting to me beacuse I love their football games and weather and I also know about their culture to visit their place that is historically important. How about you?

"Since I am a freshman in university, I have a lots of assignments and test, so there is no time to travel. Nevertheless, I have time to go trip when the semaster ends and I can imagine when this time comes. If I have the oppertunity to go travel a foriegn country, altough all countries in the world are great, I feel that I will visit china.
First of all, chinese culture is similar to Korea. Since china and korea is adjusted for a long time, both countries share their culture, and this simimarity makes me feel comfortable when I visit a strange place. 
In addition to the cultural similarity, I want to visit china because of the developed food cultue. Chinese food is one of the most common food in the world. There are a lot of chinese restautant in global and most people knows the chinese.  Furthermore, since I like to enjoy new foods, I want to go to china and exprience the chinese food culture.
Finally, one of the important reason why I want to go china is that I haven't go to there before. I think the purpose of travel is experiencing new, so I want to go somewhere I have never visited, and china is one of them. Thus, I want to go there and exprience new culture by visiting the historical places.
In short, china is a good place for me to travel because of the similarity of culture and the develpoed eatingculture. Moreover, I have never been china. For this reason, if I have a oppertunity to travel fo two weeks, I will go to china and enjoy lots of chinese culture: foods and historical places."	3	3	3	9
1980	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are so many people that go travel to foreign country. They travel because of many reasons like leisure and work. I think that traveling to foreign country is experience. So If I have the opportunity to travel, I must be going to travel Japan. In addition, I have three reasons why I want to go Japan. First of all, Japan has East Asia, so Japanese people have culture that they eat rice. It is very important to eat delicious food to survive not just enjoy. For example, I can't eat many foods in America because they is very salty. However, in Japan, I can eat a lot of foods with rice. I can't live without meals, so I have to go where has foods which have proper taste. The second reason that I want to go Japan is the subcultures. I have hobby that watching animation and cartoon. In addition, Japan makes animation and cartoon very well. It means when I go to Japan, I can buy the goods of my favorite character. I will happy with my goods, and I think it means the travel is fun. Finally, Japan is very close to Korean. When I went to U.S.A, I can't sleep in night and I tired on daytime. Because U.S.A is too far for Korea, I need to change my sleeping pattern. However, I think it is wasting my time, so I don't want to change sleeping pattern. It is very good to hear that Japan is close to Korea. Tokyo use the same time with Seoul so I can sleep on time. To summarize, Japan has foods similar to Korea so I can eat well. In addition, there are subculture goods of my favorite characters. Finally, I don't need to change my sleeping pattern. Traveling Japan has many benefits to me, so I want to go to Japan. If the covid19 is finish, I will go to Japan with my friends."	2	2	2	6

"Have you ever been in foreign countries? If you have a chance to visit some country, what country do you want to visit? In my case, I want to visit Germany. There are three reasons why I want  to visit Germany.
     The first reason is that because Germany locates at middle of Europe, I can visit wherever I want to visit in Europe. They are connected by EU, so  I don't need to get a permission to journey some countries from the countries in Europe.
     The second reason why I want to visit Germany is that the country was saperated by a wall between east and west Berlin. Korea is saperated by 38 line into south and north now. Although Germany had had a similar history to Korea, the country could distroy the wall thanks to their own power. I want to learn their unity and try to apply the mind to Korean.
     Lastly, Germany has developed their own technology in fields of mechanics and aerospace. As Germany started World War II, they could develop their own technology of engneering like tanks and fighter aircrafts. Of course, people of Germany reflected their history and apologized the war to the all over the world. As I am a student of aerospace engneering, I want to study some topics in Germany.
     As a conclusion, because of above reasons, if I hace the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks, I would like to visit Germany. Why don't you visit Germany?"	4	4	3.5	11.5
1982	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"The United States: A Country to Visit and Expand Knowledge

    There are many countries worldwide, and lots of people visit foreign countries for various purposes. Going abroad is a source of new experiences. For example, some people may go studying, and some people may want to relax through traveling. Some other people would try to get some inspirations of their life, too. There are many countries to visit, such as Japan, France, Thailand, and Canada. Among varios countries, I would like to visit the USA for three reasons.
    To begin with, I can experience how the center of global economy is being changed by visiting the USA. One significant point that influences global economy is IT industries. Since many IT corporations, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Google is in the US, visiting these companies would be a great experience to learn what is the vision of these companies and what is their bluepints to expand their future. This might sound unrealistic, however, there might be a chance for me to visit these corporations such as internships. In addition, there is a famous place that represents of world economy, the Wall Street, so by visiting there I can see directly how the global economy is changed by some factors.
    Moreover, since English language is spone worldwide and the US is one of the country that uses English as main language, I can learn English by going there. Learning a foreign language only by myself and university lectures has some limits, and attaining chances to talk and think in the foreign language lively is a great chance to surely get familiar with the language. Therefore, I believe that I can improve my English skills through visiting the US and making many conversations with native English speakers.
    Last but not Least, in addition to expand my sight to world economy and studying English, I can get some inspirations by seeing numerous landmarks in the US. There are many places to visit, from the great nature to the Skyscrapers. For example, we can see the Grand Canyon, the Niagara Falls, the Statue of Liberty, the Metropolitan Museum and Smithonian Museum. The first two will give me refreshment because of the giant pose of the nature, and the third one will make me thrilled to see a large artificial architect built by human. The latter two are a collection of the history of how people lived and what people enjoyed. So they will expand my point of view and give me various thoughts of what I should do in the future to make my life meaningful.
    To sum up, I would visit US if I have an opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks, because I can learn global economy, English language, and the brilliant sights of the US. I agree that there are many other beautiful countries to visit. However, for the reasons stated above, I strongly belive that visiting the US will be the most helpful to me. "	5	5	5	15

"  These day, visiting a foreign country is very restricted becasue of COVID-19.  Although it may  hard to travel other country now, I always ready to travel around the world  after the end of pendemic era. There are some wonderful place in Asia, but I really want to visit Italy again.
  First of all, there are many historical place such as tower of Pisa, Rome. I enjoy visiting or traveling to historcial place because it help understanding the historical background and culture of that country. Especially, my favorite city in Italy is Rome. Since it is the core city of the history of Greece-Rome era, traveling the famous place in Rome is the best way to experince the history of Europe and learn the historical background of Italy. Also, I want to visit the tower of Pisa because it is known that one physicist excuted free-fall experiment which determine the same flight-time between different objects.
  In addition, I have some fantasy to Italy because of the large difference of culture. When I was young, I had  little interest of Europe. Actually, when I traveled Japan, China and Singapore, I didn't feel some strange and special mood. But, when I travel the west of Europe such as England and France, I could feel distinct different in side of mood, culture, language and view. So, I expect to experience fantasy when I visit Italy. For example, Italian eat some bread or coffee in morning, use English or their own language.
  Lastly, I had very impressive memory on Italy. When I was 15 years old, I visited Italy for three weeks with my friends. The time during I traveled around the Italy is remained very nice memory because it really funny. All of the elements of travel were specail to me. Therefore, if I have some opportunity to visit a foreign country, I choice Italy.
  To sum up, if I have some chance to choose the country to visit, I choose Italy because it have historical place and fatasy and memory."	4	3.5	3	10.5

Even there are a book named 'Reasons for Travel' and many other guidebooks for traveling. There are several reasons why people travel. At first, people want to take a rest by traveling. Watching nature and being free from their works, they can get energy again. That is why people buy camping cars to travel on weekends. Secondly, people travel to experience various culture and tradition. In other countries, all of things such as language, foods, and people you meet are new. People can experience other culture and have exciting memories. In addition, there are many festivals on many different places traditionally. These intrigue people to travel. Lastly, people can visit famous places and see famous structures. If you travel Europe, you will be surprised by many historical places and structures. It is same with other countries.

1985	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"What is human's favorite hobby? listening to music?, or  sports like football ? I guess  travel will take place in one of them.
then  why people love to travel.

First, People need to go far away from familiar place.
If you go to school, or work, you may see same place, same people everyday. It  is quite stressful if you don't like that place and people. but travel is easy way to get away from that situation. you can see beautiful sceneary around where you travel. and also you can meet various kinds of people that you haven't met before in guesthouse, or something else. so It can be one of the reason  why people travel.

Second, people want to join hottest place in their nation or worldwide.
If purpose of travel is healing, the reason why they travel will be the first reason I said. but there are  other kinds of travel like go to festival like Worldcup in Katar in next year, or go to famous cities like Paris, Rome, New York.... the reason why they go to those places is that they heard to others , or saw it on the Internet that It is quite nice and also want to fell atmosphere in festival. So I think that want to joining hottest place is can be on of the reason.

Finally, they want to tell others about their experience with IG or other SNS.
Most of people who been there upload their pictures or videos in  several SNS they have, and their friends give heart or like to it. It may reflect travel to somewhere is way to show how I'm good to others. so I think It is one of the reason why people travel in modern times

So, I think those are main reason why we travel in modern times. Due to travel. people can get things like pictures, videos. And they also can get relation with their old or new friends, and good expirience. Because of Covid-19, lots of people decline their plan to travel. but I hope to see end of Covid-19 and travel to somewhere  and want to do great expirience."	3	3.5	2.5	9
1986	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  In my opinion, there are two reasons why people travel. They want to see  many kinds of view and experience a lot of special and exicted things.
   First, people really want to travel ocean, river or flower festival and so on. People usually live in city and they are busy to go and see natural view so they want to escape the high buildings and busy their life. I think it also help their remove stress. I usually go to park and walk alone when I really have many stressful things. Because almost people have stressful things in their work place or school, they need to escape their real life to travel. Traveling natural place heal tired people and help their mind keep health. 
   Second, I think that people want to experience many funny things by traveling place which they do not know well. It has many limts that they can do things at home or nearby their neiborhood. So when people want to do active things, they need go some other places. In fact, people almost remebered and tell  funny and exicted things they experieced in traveling when I asked their traveling. Also, I remember more what I do in traveling than where there was when I recall my traveling. 

   To sum up, I think that people travel beacuse of removing their stress and experience special things they can remember long time."	3	3	3.5	9.5
1987	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Traveling is one of major leisure activities that people do. People travel to the world's famous place, travel to their own country, or sometimes even try to travel to the space. From the past, traveling is very familiar activity to human. In this essay, I will explain about my opinion of why people travel.  I think there are three reasons that people travel. 
 First, I think people travel because of refreshing. As people doing works in normal days, their stress increases and people become tired by doing their work. To relieve their stress and to rest, people trying to find activities that they can refresh themselves. Traveling is a good way of refreshing because people are free to their works and have good time in the traveling place. Watching great view of traveling place can give people somekinds of motivation to live their life, or healing in the traveling place can give people extra power of normal days. 
 Second, people travel because traveling is the easiest leisure activity. There are many kinds of leisure activities that people can do such as sports, pc games, etc. Most of these activities need something to prepare. For example, sports like soccer, basketball, baseball, tennis need many gears and people to play with. However, we don't need many things to travel and we can even go solo traveling. By these benefits of easy preparing, people travel easily. 
 Lastly, people travel because of their curiosity. All of us have curiosity and trying to go to the place that we've never been. We have many new experience in traveling such as culture, view, and new friends. All this kinds of new experience start with our curiosity of travel. By the curiosity, people travel, have new experience, and learning important things about their life. Without our curiosity, travel can't be a meaningful activity.
 These three things are the reason why I think people travel: refreshing, easy leisure activity, curiosity. All of these points are the important characteristic of traveling. Traveling is a motivation of our life that refreshing us, easy leisure activity that we can easily do, and the result of people's curiosity. I think as people exist, traveling will go on. People will make their own memories with traveling. "	4	4	3.5	11.5
1988	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of COVID-19, many people can't travel anywhere. Despite of that situation, most of them keep journey to other country in their hearts. Why do people want to travel?
 In my opinion, people want to try something new. When people live in same routine, they can feel stable but boring. So, they sometimes want to experience exiting things. Unexpected events can refresh their lives and motivate thier work better. Tour is one of them.
 Second, voyage can connect people to others. People are exhausted due to their friendship or relationship, so they want to make a new friends who aren't in deep relation. New person who people meet in journey can be  a man who they want. In tour, they can make friends and vanish thier relation easier.
 Lastly, Traveling can make various experience. Colorful experience can make a person more smart, creative. Furthermore, people can be on other's shoeses when they experience the same things. Therefore, a person who experience many things have a many knowledge and relate a lot of people very well.
 As a result, people can get a mount of benefit in various fields by traveling around world. Why not do you travel in next vacation?"	3	3.5	3.5	10
1989	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think there are 3 reasons that people travel. 
First of all, the advantage of travel is giving people free from daily life. Many people are so tired because of their daily life. In daily life, students have a lot of things to study, and workers have many works. So, traveling is a chance to refresh themselves and take a rest. 
Second, traveling is visiting new wonderful space. Usually, people go trip  to famous space which they have not been to and which are wonderful and beautiful. 
Visiting new space can give a new scene and new feel to people. I think these are reasons that people travel. 
Third, traveling with my friends and family is very exciting and fun. Generally when i was playing with my friends, we just eat food together and play game and go cafe. But, traveling with friends is not common. So, this can be a good memory to me and friends. For example, In summer vacation, I went national train trip with my friend. As we go many places, we can do many things. I think this trip is special because of my friend. 
In sum, Free from daily life by travel, visiting new space and new things, and traveling with good people are the reasons that i think people travel. "	3	2.5	3	8.5
1990	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  People who travel all around the world is increased and many airplane company make new load for them. There are several reasons why they travel such as learn new culture, and achieve their dream.
  First, peopole want to learn new culture. There are many countries in the world and they have their own culture for each. There are many good culture all around the world such as greeting and life. In USA, they say 'excause me' when they go between others, but many people just go without express in Korea. In addition, many poeple want to know another culture because they need. Company worker need to know their culture to sell their goods and students need to know their friend's contrie culture.
  In addition to culture, people travel to their dream.  Each person has own dream, for example my friends Jungyeong's dream is see a EPL soccer game. Maybe almost dreams will be achieved in their own countrie, but some of them isn't. The Korean who want to do skydiving will go another countrie to achieve them because they feel more achievement when they do another countrie.By traveling, they can also make a new dream because they have good experience with new friends and places.
  To sum up, there are many good things like experience culture, and achieve dreams by traveling. By traveling, you can learn more about world and it will be good to your life. "	3	2.5	2.5	8
1991	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, you may have heard your friends saying, ""I want to travel to somewhere after Covid-19!"" Why do people really like traveling and want to travel? Let me give you reasons why people travel.
     First, they are very tired of daily life. Usually, our life is repeating. Today is similar to yesterday and tomorrow will be similar to today. And this pattern can give people stress and make people want to get out of this pattern. Traveling can be a good solution for this. So, traveling can give good feeling because they are out of their usual life.
     Second, traveling is a good experience. Sometimes people grow up with experiences. This means, after they experience something, they can notice or learn something. Travel can be a good experience too! For example, I went to Hawaii when I was 16 years old, and I saw a farm which is used in 1910s. Seeing that and listening to explanation of that farm, I could understand how our ancesters lived and what they would felt in those times. I noticed that we should remember them and their hard life.
     Finally, traveling is good for the relationship. There is a survey that says ""After the travel, relationship with friends who people travel with became good for almost 70%."" During the travel, people can be with other people who are traveling with them for the long time, so they can talk more and make some good memories with them. It gives a good effect on relationship between them.
     To sum it up, I think people like to travel for these three reasons. So, if you want to experience something good, make some good relationship, or want to go out of daily life, I recommend you to travel to somewhere!"	4	3.5	4	11.5
1992	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" In COVID-19 era, people are restricted in life style. Unfortunately, Talking without mask, taking a party or meeting face-to-face and traveling aborad are impossible. However, if this pendemic situations pass away, we will travel arounding the world. There are some reasons why people travel.
 First of all, traveling provides wider perspective to us. I believe the person who experience many other countries is able to think more widely. Becasue we can break down the stereotype about some minor culture and get completely opposite view of specific culture during traveling. For example, when I went to China, I really shocked to eat bugs. Also I shocked to eat only breads and eggs in morning when I went to Europe. But I could break the stereotype through traveling.
 Second, traveling is one of the best way to refresh. Now, ""healing"" is being a trend to young people. Because they want work-life balance, they usually travel in summer or winter. Maybe, the main goal of traveling is refreshing the boring life that repeat same way every day and get more energy to work hard when  they come back to their working place. When we go traveling, we are able to enjoy  comfortable life and forget something bad or sad. For example, I feels happiness and joy when I waiting for entering a gateway in airport.
 Lastly, traveling is a good chance to experience new culture and life style. Traveling is an act that traveler is mixed into new culture. For example, if I go to America,  I have to use English and eat hamburger or steak. If I go to Europe or Egypt, then I can visit museum or ancient structure such as Pyramid. Turly, it is more effective to study other countries' culture (language, foods, history, tranditional culture, society, etc ...) through the traveling than just reading a textbook. "	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
1993	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Theseday, many people's move very busy to work on company or study. Travel  is good way to refresh their daily life so there are 3 reasons why people go to travel. Travel can reduce their stress, make strong relationship between travel members and they experience something new by staying other places.
 First, eating delicious food and watching beautiful landscape are most important ways to reduce stress. When people go to trip, they don't have to concentrate their work and can concentrate on enjoying travel. 
 Another reason is trave members' relationships will be stronger than they don't. They should be together all day long so, they have many times to talk and know each others. In my case, last vacation, I went to trip with my friends. Although it was short trip and near places, we are be a bestfreinds each others and planning next trip. 
 The most important reason is people can experience something new by visiting other palces. Every places are not same especially, far reigons or other countries. Different place has different culture and people. We can feel someting fresh through enjoy other cultures or talking with peoples who lived in there. Not only fun we can also learn many things through these activity. 
These reasons are why people likes to travel . It is hard to go travel thesedays beacause of COVID19 but, I recomand you to travel with few peoples."	3.5	3.5	3	10
1994	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowadays because of advantages of high technologies, people can easily watch traveler attractions not only do go there but also in internet no matter where they are. However, difference between two methods of watching attractions is very huge. Now, I will talk about why it is.

First, traveling can be good for our health.  It may be different what people's purpose to go travel, I think it's common that they want to get away from their work. In terms of that, traveling can cure our mental health because we can get some rest. Additionally, because in most of travele site, there are many places and sight to watch so we can exercise despite just a little. Traveling can refresh us both mentally and physically. 

Second, traveling can motivate us. In high school 1st, we went to USA for field trip. We went not only several famous attractions like Time Square but also famous university like MIT and Harvard. In there, I could feel national atmosphere and talk with foreiners americans as well as European. In additon, when I was young, I have been to Europe, France, Germany, Italy, etc.  In there, I could do see 'real attractions' , for example Eiffel Tower and Monariza,  in my eyes, and it was quite different with wathichg them in book or internet.  The fact that I really watched it make not only me but also others so that we could have unforgettable memories and had converation with real foreiners face to face gave me such confident, and it affect me even now. Furthermore, beacause I have unforgettable experiences, I can dream my goals bigger than berfore. In order to go there again and achieve my goals, I try to do my best whatever I do after traveling.

1995	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In modern society, most of people are following their life routine. They wake up, go to work, come back home and sleep. This is too boring and make people exhausted. People want to break their life routine. They need more unique experience to refresh and traveling is one of the best way to get some unique experiences. There are three reasons.
First, we can see different sight. In the everyday routine, people see same buildings, same road and same people. But when we travel, there's new buildings and cultures. Watching unfamiliar sight can be special experience to people. They feel interesting to everything and feeling interesting is good at refreshing.
Second, we can eat different foods. Every country has their own special foods. We can eat curry when travel to India. We can eat sushi when travel to Japan. Even in the same country, there are many special foods by region. Eating unfamilar and delicious foods makes people happy.
Finally, we can listen different languages. Most of people use one language during everyday routine. But when we travel, we can listen different languages or accect. Sound this important because it is always effects to people. Listening unfamiliar sound can be a special experience.
This is my opinion about why people travel. Why don't you think about your own opinion? I'll expect about opinions. Thank you."	3	2.5	2.5	8
1996	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think there is 2 reasons people travel.
First one is to see lot of things. If we travel to abroad, we can see many things. It can be other countries' landmark, or houses and markets in the cities. We can also have a chance to experence others countries' culture like how they saying hello, what they usually do when they meet, or just that country's local festival. It can be a useful experence because when you come back to home, range of your thought become wider. It means you can thought like them because you experence their culture and thoughts directly, not just reading books or listening about their culture. It is very positive points because you can find out new ways to solve problems of your life, or when you meet foreigners, you can easily feel their thoughts and feelings. It could be really helpful experences on your life.
Second reason is for refreshing our mind. When we live our life, most of days are just daily routines. For instance, students go to schools at same time, and repeating study by schedule. And kind of working mans and womans, they repeating to go company and working to get money. So, most people didn't see new places or people. They just see same place and same people. This kind of life is not bad, but they might feel boring and exhausted by repeating schedules. But when they travel not only abroad, just other places in their country, they can see a lot of different places and people not like their daily routines. It can be a huge forest, or beach that many people play on, or a landmark what they want to see. It can refresh their life and make happier when thay travel, or even make a goal to work hard. There are some people who don't go travel, but watching camping youtube or other landmark's picture. They not do it for no reason, it's because they want to feel refreshing their life, but they don't have time for it."	3	2.5	3	8.5
1997	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Have you ever traveled other places? Especially I  remember that I have been Toyko, Japan with my family.  I think that there are three reason why people travel.
 First, you can learn new things. Generally, people said get experience when you travel. you can know culture in place where you travel. It is ture. But I want to tell you another things that your's wrong or fixed thought(?).When I was young, I read about Japan. According to the book, Japan's consumer price is more expensive than Korea's, because Japan is more wealthy than Korea. However, Toyko's price wasn't expensive  when I have been Toyko. 
Second, take fun memory. In Toyko, we usally moved train. We go Dizney land, Gundam(?) museum, Tonkitote(?) shopping center etc. we can make fun memory in Toyko. Also, I have been beiging, China, with my family and friends. I remember that I can eat chinease food very well, but other friend cannot eat chinease food. So, friends said me amazing. I think
Third,  you can exit bad things, and change your's life. I was so sad because I failed Incheon science academy. My confidence was decreasing. My family were concerned about that. So, we planned that we traveled toyko. Toyko's travel can released my exhaused mind, and I could set a new goal that I enter science high school. So, I entered science high school."	2.5	2.5	2	7
1998	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"What do you think travel is? Maybe many people think go to another place from hometown and watch or feel new things. I agree, but I want to add some definition. Not noly about place, but also try new things can be some kind of travel. So, I will talk some reasons why people travel.
First, life is boring. Wake up morning, go to school or some place to work and working very hard. Finally, come back home at late time even over AM 12:00. It is boring and also tired. We need refresh and take some energy from new things. So, people want to go some new place and eat various food, walk and take a photo at new place.It is fun and exciting so this activities can give lots of energy. Also try new things can be helpful to energize your life like try new sports or activites, meet new people! This is the reason why I added the definition of travel.Because it is same, give new energy. But, there can be exist having fun and happy life. In this case, the purpose of travel can be change.
Second, learn new things. People have different culture, food, life style by country even region. Many people watch new country, food, life styles on TV or youtube. They think ""I want feel and learn that things!"". It is useful to learn new things, because when you make new friend from some place that you learned, It is very easy to make friendship. Also, learn by yourself is okay. It means when you feel what i have to do in my life, go to some new place. Just walk and meet new people, then you may get nice tips to live your life and what to do.
There are two reasons why people travel. I think the important point of this reason is people travel to get some evergy. When you feel your life is boring, Why don't you go some new place?"	3	2.5	2.5	8
1999	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Why people traval? I think there are two main reasons.
First, they need a refreshment. In modern society, many people are working hard but haven't enough time to get a rest. Even taking a rest, they get some call from other workers. And traveling is one of the best way not to be disrupted by others while taking a rest. So I think, many people travel to take a rest and get refreshment. 
Secondly, travel can give some oppertunities to get vary experience. Near the living place, it is limited to get diverge experience because the nearing people are sharing their cultural backgrounds. However, when we go travel, we can meet people who have diffenent cultural background and we can learn somthing from them. This experience may give us some new perspective about life, or new ideas for unsolved problems. So, many people travel to exprience more and get inspired from it.
Traveling is a good chance to get refreshments and new experiences. However, many people cannot travel to other country and even are limited to travel  in the country due to COVID-19. I'm hoping some day when COVID-19 is ended and many people could travel around freely."	3	3	3	9

It's because many people love to travel. Why do people like traveling? I think people do so because get several special things. I'll introduce three reasons why I think so.

 First, people can get each own whole relaxing times so they can refresh. people who are stressed from daily life, such as working, or repeated boring and hard days..., really need to take some rest. When people travel, they can get their own time so that they are energized again.

 Second, people can get opportunity to  meet new people by traveling. We are observe new people and experience new type of lifestyle, thought, behavings, etc. Some people even make new friends through travels. This opportunity will be the good base to do some anything in the future. 

 Third,  people travel to get new experience. During travel, we experience new things. For examples, we can go new places, buy new goods, taste new foods, and can experience new culture, such as, Korean going Japanese temple, tasting  japanese foods by travel. As we experience more, we will think more colorful, behave in various ways. Through them, we can make new ideas, ways...anything. These will be helpful to each others and to the world.

 Because of these three reasons, I think people travel because they can get these special things. We can't get these three things in usual day easily so I think they travel."	2.5	2.5	2	7
2001	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"People are used to go travel to many other places, or foreigns. In addition, I like traveling too. Then why people like leave from their home?
I think the first reason is that they experience something different. In their home, there are many things people can't do. But when they leave from home, they can do the different things like sleep in the hotel, or watch the beach. 
Second, people can blow out their anxiety. When people see the nature, they will think nothing except what they see. They will not have more worries with travel.
Finally, people can exercise when they travel. For example, people in the bicycle club can go travel with bicycle. They will ride a bike when they move, and their calories will be burned.
There are so many benefits for traveling. When you have never traveled, I hope you to go travel as soon as possible."	2.5	2	2.5	7

In news or paper, many people feel movies and TV to negative because of the reasons including overdose, violence. But, I think movies and TV influence people's behavior to positive ways. There are two reasons to support my opinion.

 First, you can experience new thing by movies or TV. In TV, we can travel South Africa, Mt. Everest, India. And not only travel foreign site but also learn new  culture and knowledge. In addition to experiencing new thing, we can experience more abundant feeling by watching movies or TV. For example, people who haven't did love will not know the feeling of affection. But, by watching romance movies, they can feel what is love and how do people in love do.  

 Second, It can be great education media. For young child, they can't attention to one thing in long time. But, as you can see around us, children who are watching TV or video can attention to that thing in long time. Like this, if we make education movie or TV program for children, they can study more fun way and their parents can do less effort to make their children study. 

 To sum up, because of experiencing new thing or feeling, and being good education media, I think movies or TV influence people's behavior to positive ways. Movies or TV industry will develop more and more in future. And we will feel more positive effect by movies or TV. "	4	4	3	11
2003	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Today, many people enjoy movies and TV programs. Movies or TV program sometimes have a message in it, so they can influence people' behavior. They can affect people to do better for three reasons. Firstly, they can give lots of information which is hard to know easily. People can get some ideas for how to live their life well by learning about how to prevent cancer or how to diet effectively. These useful information help people to do some acts for their health. In addition, the message of movies or some TV programs can change someone's life.

2004	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Watching movies or TV is good hobby that many people enjoy. I think that movies or TV programs can affect people's behavior for two reasons. First, there are various types of movies or TV programs like romance, SF, entertainment, and news. As the types are various, people have own their favorite genre. If someone likes romance, that person usually watches romance movies or TV programs. While watching these movies, the person can feel the characters' feelings, too. Also, the person starts to think 'If I am the character that appear at that movie, what will I do?'. When those kinds of thinking is accumulated, the person's behavior can change naturally. Second reason is about news. Among various types of TV programs, news is the best method to learn information that can be affected to people. So, people who don't have hobby at watching movies watch news to learn information. When the information is serious problem to people, that information can influence people's behavior. For example, covid-19 is serious disease today. Since news notify people that hundreds people who have covid-19 are increased for a day, people's lifestyle is done at home usually. People's fear that covid-19 gives people makes people stay at home. This phenomenon seems good effect that news influences people's behavior. In conclusion, when people watch movies that fit their own favorite genre with thinking and news gives serious problem, these movies or TV programs can influence people's behavior."	3	4.5	3.5	11
2005	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think TV programs or movies makes people become crucial and don't think about ethical things. Whether some TV programs and movies give us good messages, I think overall TV programs and movies makes people crucial with 2 reasons.

First, director of movie and PD wants many people watch their program. So, they don't express common stories that people experience in their life. Therefore, directors of program try to make new stories that people have an interest and these trend makes programs more crucial and none ethical. For example, Squid game made a  mega-hit recently, but idea and story of Squid game was already made about 10 years ago. About 10 years ago, this story was so crucial enough to cut by people who determine program can exposed to people. But nowadays, these programs are exposed to us and made a mega-hit on worldwide. It means directors effort to take people's interest made crucial stories and people become more crucial.

Second, expressions in movies and TV programs is not good so these effects people none ethical. In movies, most characters of movie who take cool guy use bad expressions and in the movies, it makes them seems cool. For example, In criminal movies, head of criminal groups easily kill other people and their expression to make atmosphere is so bad. On TV programs, dramas are similar with movies and entertainment programs which purpose is make people funny, they criticize other to make people laugh and these strong criticize and expressions are accepted naturally by people because it is fun. Therefore, bad and strong expressions in movies and TV programs make us none ethical.

To summarize, movies and TV programs give us fun and want more watching of us, but these purpose makes us crucial and none ethical because of some crucial stories or bad expressions. I recommend you avoid some crucial and none ethical programs or movies because it is not good for your behavior. Remind these programs are unreal!"	3.5	4	3.5	11

Movies or TV influence people's behavior in three ways. First, People can experience new things by watching TV or movie. Even though people don't have enough money, people can travel universe by SF movie. Also they can see rare animal through an animal documentary like ""Animal's world"". As watching TV or movie, people can expand their own experience. Second, TV or movie gives new issue and various view about society easily.

However, when people watching news in the morning they can know about not only daily issue but also various people's opinion easily. Finally, TV or movie makes trends. People want to have the bag which celebrities brings on TV show and the things showed in movie. For example, Dalgona in ""Squid game"" is famous in SNS.

In this entertainment, various influence is casting. Even looking at many cases around us, this influence people should be careful about their behavior. In fact, many influence people collapsed due to controversy their private lives. Therefore, I'm certain that influence people should do their behavior to be careful, legal, and exemplary. 
First, influence people's behavior should be careful. Since they are often showed in public sites, their behavior can affect to general people. Actually, the perception about discrimination against women has changed since the influence people mentioned it in movies or TV shows. In other words, their words and actions can have a very great influence to others.
Second, influence people's behavior should be legal. There is a say ""The source of country's power is from the public. If the influence people don't obey the law, then the law loses their power, and it is a shortcut to lose country's power. I mean the influence people should obey the law first, then the public may obey the law, too. Therefore, the country will get more and more power under the law.
Last, influence people's behavior should be exemplary. Because, as I said early, the influence people have a lot of influence on the public. Therefore, if they do unexemplary things, public can think unexemplary thing is okay. In fact, there are many age restrictions at movies or TV shows for these reasons. To do exemplary things, they can make better worlds.
It is apparent that influence people's behavior has a significant influence in public.  Influence people can change social perception, make our country get more power, and make the world better by adjusting their behavior. For our better future, influence people should be careful, legal, and exemplary."	3	4	3.5	10.5

First of all, it is human relationship. People share their experience about movies or TV with other people. When people talk about movies or TV, they can make intimate mood. However, if you want to talk with those who didn't watch movies or TV, you are badly hard to make intimate mood. For example, recently common subject of conservation among people is squid game because squid game became famous all over the world. 
Second, movies or TV can affect language. People's language are easily influenced by movies or TV. After people watch movies or TV, people imitate dialect or word selection of those that appear in TV or movies. For example, people who mostly watch news imitate anchor. If people who watched past movies, people imitate their manner of speaking.

They watch TV and movies, because actors or actresses who they like are acting in movies or dramas, or they like the story of TV shows, dramas, and movies. Therefore, people are affected by movies or TV naturally. How do movies or TV influence people's behavior? I would like to give some examples how movies and TV influence people.
  First of all, people sometimes think real life and movies are similarly. For example, someone think falling from 2nd or 3rd floor to ground is not that dangerous, because in movies, actors are falling from 2nd or 3rd floor to ground very nicely, and they are no problem after falling. However, in real life, this behavior is very dangerous. In this way, movies and TV confuse people. 
  Furthermore, people tend to imitate celebrities. For positive example, if one celebrity donates some money or their talent to poor people in TV program, people who like the celebrity donates to poor people, too. However, for negative example, if another celebrity show his or her bad mind such as ignore socially weak people in TV program, people who like or respect the celebrity become have that bad mind, too. 
  Lastly, movies or TV programs make people have right mind and know some facts which we have to know. For instance, 'Gaksital' which is TV drama shows how Japan colonize Korea. So if we see this TV drama, we can know how Japan colonize Korea, become have mind that love their own country.
  To sum up, movies or TV influence people's behavior a lot. People sometimes think reality and movies are same, people tend to imitate celebrities.

2011	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In my opinion, movies or TV can control people's mind and make people do specific behavior because of two specific reasons.
First, movies or TV can show specific part of some incident.  Most of TV program or movies do some cutting activity to make high quality video. But some people who produce Tv program or movies can use this to control people's mind who watch these videos.  Most of people call this situation 'Devil's cutting' and they recognize this problem. For example, if directors who produce some TV program want to show specific person very bad,  they can use original video to show specific part of some situation. Then lots of people can think this person very bad because of specific part of original video.

Second, movies or TV can advertise anything. When directors or someone who want to produce movie or TV program, they need a lot of money to make their program.  So they have to find investor to produce thier TV programs or movies.  After that, directors have to find advertisement to earn money. Because of this process, movie or TV advertise something and object of advertisements can be anything such as specific person or items.  These advertisement can make people to do specific behavior or have specific mind. For example, if famous TV program or movies advertise some items such as clothes, smart phones, or anything,  it can increase these item's revenue. 


To sum up, TV or movies can make people to do specific behavior and to have specific mind. Advertisement and cutting original video can cause this and already lots of problems about this exist."	3	3.5	3.5	10

There are various TV programs which are funny and have lots of information. Because of developing TV programs, people tend to be at home in their free time. There are three reasons why TV makes people be at home. 
First, people can have experience of any part without going out. For example, many people watch movies with TV without going to movie theaters. Because of convenience of TV, they like staying at home, and their amount of activities are decreased. 
Second, it is too easy to control. On weekdays, they work hard and get stress because it is not easy to do what they want. So, they want to do what they want and be lazy about everything on weekends. In the past that TV was not quite developed,  people found new things to do on weekends. However, they can easily control the remote control, and pick what they want to see nowadays.
Last, people talk about popular TV programs in their meeting. We can easily hear that people usually talk about what they saw yesterday on TV. If someone didn't watch that program, it is difficult to participate to conversation. So, they watch that program on weekends because they don't have enough time on weekdays. Like this, TV almost gets into our conversation and makes more people curious about it.
 The summary of reasons why people like staying at home and watching TV are that they can have experience many things, it is easy to control, and they want to participate to conversation. Consequently, there are many people who have hobby for  being at home to watch TV. "	3	3.5	3.5	10

Now, assume that you watch TV or Movies that have a same story of the book. Since visual and sound information helps you to understand the situation, you can make the assumption easily: ""If I experience that situation, what can I do?"" or ""what will I do?""

 First of all, the videos have been much important hobbies. Now, the movies and TV programs are not the videos that we should watch at specific time.

The trend of the fashion, music, traveling site, and also the way to speak is affected by the videos that we can see through the TV and movies. For example, the hair style that is called '박새로이컷' was the trend of the last year, which was started from the drama called '이태원 클라스'. As everyone in the world is watching movies or TV program everyday, it is sure that they are influencing the trends of peoples' styles.  However, not like the past, there are some trends that not following a specific celebrity or the time is now a new type of trend. Because, people can watch so many videos that are from another country or that was made decades ago, it is obvious that various style is now influencing people.

"After TV was invented, many video contents like movie, Drama, TV show and News developed a lot.  And now we use mobile phone or Tablet to watch video contents through Netflix and YouTube. So I think people influenced a lot from TV or movie. 
First, people are sensitive to trend. people want to belong to group. So if they don't know trend, they can't belong to large group. Because in group we need to use meme or trend expression. I think movies and TV provide these trends. For example after '극한직업'  become popular, many people find '수원 왕갈비 통닭'. Because '극한직업' provided a trend, '수원 왕갈비 통닭'. And if an actor wear a clothes,  many people want to buy that. These are evidences the TV and movie influence people's behavior.

 There are three movies or TV effects that influence people's behavior. First, they make people buying some expensive product in them. Movies or TV include many advertisements, and these attract people to buy expensive product.

2021	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"These days, Many people enjoy watching movies or TV for their hobby. So movies or TV can change people's behavior. Some people argue that movies or TV can change people more violent because many producer want to make only exciting program. I don't agree about their opinion because many movies or TV programs are meaningful and educational. So I think movies or TV can make people's behavior better to various ways.
   Firstly, Many people can remember their important history to watch movies or TV programs. Many producer make historical movies or historical documentary to awake historical identify. For example, Some people don't know about 'General Lee Soon-Sin' before ""Myeong-Ryang"" was released. Many people watch the movie ""Myeong-Ryang"" and they can know about his story. 
   Secondly, Many people can learn about new information. Many people like SF movies and scientific documentary because many amazing technology appear in them. Some technology is future's technology but it can awake our scientific curiosity. For example, When the movie ""Marsion"" was released, many people want to learn about space and Mars to understand the movie. Movies and TV programs can make curiosity about some subject.
   Lastly, Many people can get opportunity of self-examination. Most of movies and TV programs have lesson that producers want to say for viewers. Some people can get opportunity of self-examination to understand lesson. If Dad who doesn't take care of his baby watch that documentary about family, he can understand lesson that take care of our family and he can change to good way. 
   To sum up, some people argue that movies or TV can change people more violent. I don't agree that opinion and I think movies and TV can make people's behavior to various ways. It is because they can give historical information, can give curiosity and can give opportunity of self-examination for people. So I think movies and TV can make peoples' behavior "	4	4	3	11
2022	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are two advantages of taking online courses in college. 
 First, Online courses are convenient. If we take offline courses, we have to wash all the body and go to the course room. But, if we take online courses, we can wake up little more late and do not need to go to course room. That convenience makes us more participating in study. Moreover, people who have physical disability will feel convenient because they need not to go outside. For example, There are person who need the tools that help overcome his disability. If offline  courses, he need to take that tools and he must care of that tools. But, in online courses, he can be in home and he don't need to care of that tools more than in outside. 
 Second, Online courses help late-people. Late-people means people who can't follow the courses because of their ability. In college, there are so many late person. Especially if courses take English in course language, or other country language for foreign, student can confuse more. In this case, watching the online courses uploaded in college site again can help that late-people. We can do study repeat and repeat again as we want!
 For conclusion, taking online courses in college have some advantages. They are convenient and can help late-people. Online courses give the chances to people who have weakness. Whoever that people have disability, however they do study, online courses will do the new way. "	3	3	2.5	8.5
2023	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"What things that is changed after the world became pandemic compare to the past? Most of people always take the mask in public place and there is the regulation of the number of  meeting members. Also, students take their course in online using the application like zoom. Then, what are the advantages of taking online courses in college? I will give 3 reasons for that. 
First, students can safe their wasting time when they move to building between the course. In offline class, they must consider the distance and time (like lunch time) which takes between the lecture room. However, compare to offline class, students have less worry about the morning course, take more course that they really want, and use leisure time to various productive activity. It can help to proceed the ability of studying for each student, also they can grow up themselves for spending their leisure time on their own.
Additonally, students can take the online course where the place is the most comfortable. It means that students can take a lecture in their best place to study. People are affected to their environment, and especially students are more. So, making the best place to study will proceed the ability of studying for each student.
We can think 2 reasons for the advantages of taking online courses in college that safing the wasting time and giving better place to study. Of course, there are some(or many) disadvantages of online course. SoIt can be hard to choose one is the better. But obviously, we should think about what is the better for growing up the student's variable ability."	3	4	2.5	9.5
2024	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Compare with offline courses in college, online courses have disadvantages like we could be lazy or we can't meet various types of people. But, there are also various advantages of taking online courses in college. In those advantages, I think two of them take large portion.
 First thing is recorded version can be uploaded when the real time lecture is over. Not all lecture provide recorded version, but many lectures provide the recorded version. During the real time lecture, although we fully concentrate, there can be something we missed. The reason why we miss some points is the speed is too fast to understand. However, when the recorded version exists, we can learn repeatedly and we can stop that lecture at the confusing point. Therefore, we can supplement what we are missed and the lecture is more helpful for our understanding. 
 Second one is that moving time isn't needed. While we take offline courses, we must need lots of moving time. Also our college is too large to move, sometimes there is not enough time to move dormitory to lecture room or lecture room to another lecture room. In contrast, online courses just need moving zoom lecture room. We just take a few clicks for moving the zoom lecture room, so we don't need time to move. 
 In conclusion, during taking online courses, there are enough chance to review the lecture and we don't need to waste time at moving. I think those two advantages are biggest things comparing with offline courses. "	3	4	3	10
2025	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think if we take online courses, there are 3 advantages we get.
First, we can save time to move classroom. Before Covid-19, most colleges have offline class and students have to move their classroom to take a class. However, if we take online class, we don't have to move classroom so we can save time. this saved time will be use for extra class time, study time or hobby time. So time will be used more efficiently than offline class.  

Second, some online courses are providing better study environment for students. In Korea, most students have taken 40 to 50 minutes of class before college. So it is hard to students keep concentrate on over 1 hour class and almost every course in college has longer time than 1 hour. If we take online class, we can get recorded lecture videos every week and that videos are useful to study and prepare exam. Also, because of the characteristic of online class, we maybe easily get notice for homework or quiz, exam when we want. Therefore, online courses can be better environment for students to study and take course.

Third, we don't have to carry a lot of books and something for writing. Until high school, almost every student use bag-pack because we should carry books and pens. But difference with college is books for college class is very thicker than before and students must move to courses' own classroom. So, it is hard to carry books and tools for writing at college. I guess someone would say like ""If you use pdf files of book, it is enough to carry notebook or tablet."" However, we can't get pdf files that we want always and some students don't have tablet or notebooks. Also, some students prefer to study books, not pdf files. For example, in my case, even I use tablet and some pdf files, but I borrow books in library for study or homework because study with book is more convenient for me. So, we don't have to carry a lot of books and tools for writing. 
 
Therefore, with 3 reasons I wrote above, I think online courses has its own advantage in college compare to offline courses."	3	3	2.5	8.5
2026	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Online courses have some advantages. in this article, i'll write about one advantage among these. when we take the online course with Zoom, we can discuss with some topic fastly and easly. 
Let me show some reasons of that opinion. first, Zoom has a function 'screen sharing', which make student of zoom meeting can share there computer screen with others. cause of that function, we can prepare and show our material faster than offline course. we should not prepare big screen and download our own material to professer's computer cause of  easier and faster method.
Second, not like a offline course, we don' need to spend time to move to college.  what we need is just activating our computer and link to zoom meeting address. this is a huge time saving if considering whole symester.
Last, we can find knowlegde fastly to searching internet browser like google. in offline disscussing, when we need some data or missing knowledge, we should go to library. but in online discussing, we can get proper knowledge faster by searching internet while don't loss focus. furthermore we can share our searching with others. it's online course's specific advantage to save time.

cause of these reasons, if we take the online course with Zoom, we can discuss with some topic fastly and easly. "	2.5	3	2.5	8
2027	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of COVID-19, I have listened lecture in online class. It was sad because I can't meet my friends in real lecture room. But I felt many advantages of taking online courses in college. I will introduce two advantages which make online class more useful than offline class.

  First, in online course I can save my time. In offline class, We have to move the place to participate the lecture. If I have a continuous lecture, I should make my time table which is included time to move to another building. However, In online class, I don't have to consider times that are spent to move to other lecture room. For example, in offline class If my lecture finish at 12:00, I can't get lecture which starts at 12:00. Because I can't move another lecture room immediately.On the other hand, in online class, It is able to get lecture which starts at 12:00. Because I can move to another lecture room by copying and pasting. Also I can do my things at empty time that is spent to move in offline class.

Second, The people who can't read letter at longer distance can read the lecture note easily. We spend same money to college to get lecture. However it is not fair there are some student who can't listen lecture because of physical problem. And In offline class, if I want to watch the screen, I have to sit more closer to screen. The number of front seat is fised, to get front seat, I have to go to lecture room more earlier than other students. But in online class, all students can watch the same screen. So, the number of people who can't watch the lecture note is lower.  It is great advantage that all students can have same lecture. Because No one can't get lecture by physical problem. Also this advantage makes more people can listen the same lecture, there aren't space limitation.


I think there are many advantages of taking online courses in college. Because I can save my time and everyone can listen and watch the same lecture ."	3	4	2.5	9.5
2028	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In 2020, we have lots of online courses by against Covid 19. I took online courses for 2 years. By listening to online courses,  I think there are many advantages of taking online courses in college. 
First, we can watch the video again. When I watched a video, I had some difficult content to understand. Then, we can understand the difficult content by watching video again. In non-online courses, we can notice the difficult content by asking questions. So, I think it is a good advantage. 
Second, online courses need less time to prepare listening courses. When we take non-online courses, we have some time to prepare listening courses. It means we have to take shower or wear neat clothes. However, online courses don't need this time. Therefore, we can have more time to study. 
Lastly, taking online courses can decrease Covid19's infection rate. Now, the world is dangerous because of Covid19. It has high death rate and infection rate. So, if we do non-online courses, Covind19 must infect many Kaistian thorugh to classroom. So, we can be safe from Covid19 by doing online courses. 
For these reasons, I think taking online courses has a lot of advantages. "	3.5	3	2.5	9
2029	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think that there are three advantages of taking online courses. Let me introduce these advantages.

First of all, students can save the time. If we should take offline courses, students occur so many unnecessary time like walking to the class or preparing to go outside. But in online courses, we can enter the class only a few minutes, even a few seconds. Also, students can study or do the homework by using their remaining times. In my case, at the spring semester, my time table was filled of starting 9 o' clock class. However, I was not worried about that because they are online courses, actually I attended every class that do not late. 
Second, students can determine their location that take the course. Due to online courses, students must not live in campus. If student have offline courses, living dorm or living nearby campus may be essential, but now if they have the laptop or notebook, students can listen the course in any location like cafe or house. Actually, at spring semester, so many my hometown friends listened courses at their home. In my case, at midterm exam or final exam week, I often listened courses at library. So, I could manage my busy time so efficiently. 
Third, students can be more focused on the courses than offline courses. If we take the offline courses, we may not focus on lecture because there are so many campus friends. But in online course, we can only focus on lecture. Also, if we have any questions, we can acquire roommate or dorm friends or Q&A.
To sum up, I asserted advantages of online courses: students can manage their time efficiently. students can listen the course in any location and students can be more focused on the lectures. Thank you for reading my text!"	3.5	3	2.5	9
2030	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" There are many opinions about using a tablet/laptop computer in class. So today, I would like to tell you about some advantages of using a personal computer such as tablet, and laptop in class.
 First, using a tablet and laptop can be helpful to understand lecture contents. Sometimes, we can't understand what professor or teacher explain, because of many reasons that are lecture contents is too difficult, professor's explaination ability is not that good, or student doesn't concentrate in short time. Then, using a tablet and laptop will help students understand easily. There are so many informations in Internet, and we can search lecture contents comfortably. 
 Furthermore, note-taking on tablet is better than on paper. Nowadays, note-taking on tablet is really comfortable. For instance, when it comes to note-taking on paper, it is difficult that we erase what are written by ink pen. Also, it is uncomfortable that we change pen's color. On the other hand, erasing and changing pen's color are so easy that we can note what we want to write fastly.
 Lastly, laptop and tablet make us enjoy participating in class. For example, laptop and tablet can give us visual data about lecture contents. According to several studies, visual data can be helpful to be interested in lecture contents. Visual data's existence is very important to students!
 To sum up, there are several advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer. One of the reasons is that  when we can't listen to what professor and teacher say in class for several reasons, tablet/laptop computer will help us to know and understand lecutre contents. In addition, note-taking on tablet can help us  to note something that we want fastly. Finally, laptop and tablet make us interested in lecture. In my opinion, using a personal computer such as tablet, and laptop in class is really beneficial!"	3	3.5	4	10.5
2031	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, because of Covid 19, lots of school and college taking online courses instead of offline courses.  There are two types of online courses, real-time class and  recorded  class.  I want to talk about two advantages of recorded online classes.

First, we can review more efficiently when we take recorded online classes. After we watch the recorded online lecture, we can watch again the lecture. Also we can control speed of lecture and skip useless part of lecture. These are very helpful points when we review the lecture and prepare the Midterm and final tests.  Nowadays some real time classes are recorded and uploaded to review the lecture, so I think real time online classes also helpful to review the lecture. However, we can't review or check hard part of lecture well after the classes. In my opinion, the most important advantage of online classes is that we can review the lecture easier than offline classes.

Second, we can reduce importance of time and  space. When we take offline classes, we should move to the specific room and it takes time to move there. However, if we take online classes, we just turn on a computer and participate zoom meeting or click the lecture. Thanks to this, we can save a lot of time and use time more efficiently. Also we don't have to go to the college, so we can stay the home, not a domitory. Because of these points, we can do other activities more when we take online classes. 

There are many opinions about advantages and disadvantages of online courses. But because of two reasons that we can review and study more efficiently and we can use more free time to do other activities, I think online classes are more helpful to student than offline class. "	3.5	4	3	10.5
2032	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Today, we have to take online courses in college because of COVID-19. It makes our courses change. Some people don't like online courses because they think some changes make them feel difficulty. And lots of people say that campus life is disappear. But I think there are some advantages too.

 First, we can take classes without any worries about class place. Before COVID-19, some students get tired about walking place to place. They have to move to other class place after lecture time. However, online courses have no huddle for place. In online, students don't have to worry about moving. It make student feel more easy to make a lecture schedule. Before online courses They have to think about the place. So some students have to give up listening to some lecture if the class place is so far. But now, they can listen all.

 Second, online classes are easy to see professor's writing. Some lectures which have lots of students, have to do at large class. Because of that, some students try to get good seat. Some seats are hard to see writing or listen to lecture. This problem is solved by online lecture. It gives us same chance to listen lecture.

 Third, some lecture give us more freedom. Some online lecture is video lecture. Video lecture give us chance to choose time to watch it. If you don't want to listen it that time, you can change it. Also, we can listen the lecture slowly and again. If there is missing part, we can just listen it again. Because of that some of KAIST student prefer video lecture.

 To sum up, online lecture give us some advantages. It reduce worries about time for moving and lecture note. Also it makes us choose time to watch video. There are some disadvantages about online lecture too, but I hope to get good effects during online courses. Because of development of technology, we will take some online courses at the future. I think we should develop this advantages and solve some problems at this time to make better future."	3	3.5	3	9.5
2033	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Online Courses also Have Benefits

    We have to take online courses in school because of COVID-19. I have used some tools for them since I was 19 years old. Someone say that this type of classes is less effective compared to offline courses. However, sometimes it can be better. I will explain three benefits for it.
    Firstly, students can take classes in the place that they choose. For example, someone can think it is too cold while other think it is little hot. They have their own style and fitful environment. It is very difficult to merge everyone's opinions.
    Second, classes uploaded on Internet are helpful for studying. Students have different background and ability, so their speeds for studying are different, too. However, if they have uploaded videos, they can study with their tempo.
    Finally, students can be more familiar with some tools for classes. It is a good opportunity for students. These days, we have many situations that we have to use them. It will be more bigger than the past. It will be helpful for students.
    In conclusion, advantages of online courses are flexible place, replaying videos, and increasing ability for using computer tools. COVID-19 changes our life style. In this situation, thinking for good direction can help your health of mental. Although it is a bad environment, we can get successful life."	3	4	3.5	10.5
2034	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of Covid-19, students have to take online courses in college. At first, many students were bored and had some bad thoughts about online courses because they couldn't meet their friends and should be at home. However, students' thoughts have been changed slowly. 

Many students said, they can review the recorded lectures so, it is easy to study the courses. I think this is the best part of online courses. Students can listen to lectures more than one time whenever they want. Also, it is a perfect system to add the missing parts when they miss some parts. To sum up,  online courses are giving positive effect to students in studying part for these reasons.

Another thing that students feel good about online courses is they don't have  to go to lecture rooms especially in the morning. They don't need to dress up, and take a shower in the morning. Many people are very tired when they wake up and they hate the time for preparing lectures. So, they feel tired although the lectures are not started.  However, they  don't have to do such things while taking online courses in college. To sum up, online courses don't make students be tired.

Last year, online courses in college was the first trying system so, students felt uncomfortable and have some problems. But now, we are very familiar with online courses and meeting friends  and professors in zoom. Also, we found  the advantages of online courses which are helping studying lectures and not being tired with going to lecture rooms. "	2.5	2	3	7.5
2035	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Non-verbal behavior is very important for understanding someone's saying. For example, posture and gesture can give us a huge hint of the intend of some presentation. Online course which use a lot of recording-video can be advantage for student in this point. By studying some subject based on real-time lecture, students often miss a lot of portion in lecture because of the lack of consentration. Also, in some lecture which lecture-note or recorded video of class, student have to study based on their memory of the lecture. However, in online course students can freely watch lecture video in anytime of the semester and this means students do not have to back-up their memory of the lecture. This must be a huge benefit for the efficiency of study for students. Last semester when I first entered to 'KAIST', I learned a lot about speaking English by keep reviewing professor's lecture. And also, it helped me in understanding main point of lecture. For example in a lecture about 'how to note essential point when listening to lecture', my professor told us that we should write down all the specific figures(like 2034ppm). At first, this point wasn't fully understood by me because the main point of that lecture was 'to note essential points'. I thought specific figures is absolutely different from essential points of lecture. However, by looking at professor's gesture and mood, it became obvious that professor think specific figures in lecture are the essential points and by this, I can successfully understand the lecture. It is true that I can catch this point by listen carefully to professor's word, but it is way faster to find hint in professor's Non-verbal behavior."	2.5	2	2.5	7
2036	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" First of all, you can take online courses any places, and times if they are non-lives. Before the pandemic, especially like KAIST, you almost go to dormitory to take lectures easily. And it makes you tired when the distance between home and college is farther. But online classes are not care about places you take them. If you don't have any activities related to colleges and must go there, you don't get tired anymore. Furthermore, if they are non-lives, you can take it any time you want! It means that you never stressed up by getting up earlier, or taking a rest.
 Second, you can easily take it as you want, even 100 times more if you want. In offline courses, you can try only recording lectures. But in online ones, you don't have to try it if professors record their lectures. It's pretty comfortable, right? And they're more efficient to understand because most of them are given video forms. If you want to record screens and sounds in offline ones, you always take camera in the lecture room, and take a good seat to get a screen briefly.
 Lastly, anyone can take good lectures even if they're not college members. If colleges take good quality lectures and upload any website people can easily get in, people these who want to learn have a chance to do. And because of these 2 reasons as I mentioned, they also learn about they want easily and efficiently. For example, MIT already had youtube channel that uploaded what MIT students learned. Although it can when we take offline courses, it's easier to take or upload online ones than offline."	2.5	2	2	6.5
2037	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There has been a very big change about the courses that we take in the college. It is that we take our classes through internet, to avoid critical damage from corona virus. Students no longer look for the classroom for each class, but get into the link that is provided from each professor who prepares his course. Today, let me tell you about some advantages that taking online courses gives students. 
 First of all, students can take classes in comfortable area such as home and dormitory. Also, they can choose the place to take classes such as library, which was not a proper place for students to be in during the class. So it is much better to focus on the lecture, not being limited about the place, clothes, friends. For example, if we take classes in real classroom, we should take some care about our appearances such as clothes. However, the online courses make students free from those complex things that makes us uncomfortable, not related to studying. 
 Second, we can solve the problem about the time that takes to get to the school. Students that live far from the school should take too many time, only about to get in the classroom. But online courses let them able to take lectures not using much time to get to the school. It is much efficient way to spend time right after the classes, having our own time. If the online course system keep develops, we can solve a lot of problems that come from the difference of the circumstances for studying among the location. It can also be the basis to make the crowded colleges in capital city to spread through out the country. And the development of the online lecture system can let people have better qualified lectures through internet, which can help the level of education improve. 
 To sum up, these two are the advantages of the online courses in college. They are mostly about the circumstance to study, as the difference of the online class is about the way we take the lecture. I hope the online course system to develop so that we can go through the corona virus from making us difficult to take education. "	3	4	3.5	10.5
2038	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Since 2019, students couldn't take offline lectures because of COVID-19. And now Government control the citizen's offline activity. Before the end of COVID-19, we must attend online courses in college. 
 When colleges start first online courses, many students are confused. Even some students didn't know how to take lectures on online. And some researchers said that online lectures are more tired than offline lectures. So many students want offline courses.
 Then What is the advantages of online lectures? I think online lectures have about 3 advantages.
 First, we can get recorded lecture. Some professors provide recorded lecture videos. So We can repeat it. In KAIST, language of courses are English. So freshman need time to translate it. And now we can translate lectures with videos. I think it is the best advantage of online courses.
 Second, we can take more courses. If we take offline courses, we must move lecture rooms. But in online courses, we can take all lectures in my room. So in same time, we can attend more lectures and be focused in study.
 At last, we can experience the online communication. Before COVID-19, some companies tried  online meeting with foreign companies. And after end of COVID-19, companies will try more online meeting and make nice system. So these experiences are good for students.
 According to this text, online courses are better than offline courses. But I think the online technology is not perfect now. There are some errors on program and communication through Zoom aren't smooth. So I wish COVID-19 end soon and go back to offline courses."	2.5	3.5	2.5	8.5

Then what can be the advantages of taking online courses? 
To begin with, the biggest thing is that students can be safe from pandemic. Everything is going uncommon in pandemic, and also education. Maybe online classes can make students depressed and unwilling, but the important thing is that students can be safe from pandemic. If colleges provided same courses with before pandemic, virus would go around between students.
Next, students can save moving time between lectures. There are lots of colleges that have large campus. For instance, KAIST campus is large enough to spend time moving from class to class. In online classes, students can save moving time, and they can use it to study more, going work out, etc. Many students would feel that they are using time much successfully.
To sum, online courses came out because of pandemic, but there are advantages of it. Students can be safe from virus, and they can save moving times. However, there exists also disadvantages like quality issues, and hard to make friends etc. Maybe we can find some middle point that can take advantages from both online and offline courses."	3	3.5	4	10.5

So they think taking online courses is not good for student. However, I think that taking online courses have very many advantages and it can be useful for us.
   First, we can take courses many times. we can't understand all of courses, so we should study about our courses. If we take online courses, some professor give recording video to students. We can watch video many times and we can understand courses  perfectly. 
   Second, we can ask something more easily. When we ask something for professor in general courses, very many people concentrate to us. Some people don't like this situation. But if we take online courses, less people concentrate to us. So we can ask something for professor more easily.
   Lastly, we can take online courses at our free time. Some professor give recording video to us and we should watch that video once. So we should not wake up early and we can take courses at time which we want. It can be very useful for us and we should use our time more comfortably.

So, camping space is very good place beacuse it takes less time to move.
     Next, you can spend your weekend privately with your familly  at camping space. Rest privately is very important. Imagine some kids talk too loudly next of you.

In that point of view, camping space is best place to spend weekend. Most of camping space is near by mountain and river. So, in camping space, it has very good view and very good air.

2043	Recommend a good place to spend the weekend with family/friends. Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Most of people work a lot in the weekdays. People need to rest and spend time with family. Hotel is a best place to spend the weekend with family.
  First, there has many facilities to play and rest in hotel. You can watch Netflix or movie  in the room or  take a bath at the bathtub. Also, you can swim in the swimming pool or exercise in the fitness center if you want. You can join dinner at the buffet, too. Like this, hotel has various places to rest and play.
  Second,  you can save the time. When you are going around at outside, you have to move and walk a lot. However, you do not use a lot of time to move when you are in the hotel because the hotel is equipped with all the facilities. Shortening moving time is meaningful because you can play more.
  Lastly, It is safer than playing outside.  Because of COVID-19, it is dangerous to go outside. But in hotels, everything can be solved, so distance to move can be shorter. The route is limited in hotel. Also, hotel disinfects rooms everyday. Therefore, the risk of exposure to COVID-19 is low. 
  To sum up, the hotel has many facilities, so you can save time and it is safer than outside. In conclusion, the hotel is optimized for rest, so I recommend hotel to spend the weekend with family."	3	3.5	3.5	10
2044	Recommend a good place to spend the weekend with family/friends. Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are many places to spend the weekend with family or friends. Mountain, ocean, other country are examples of that. Surrounding by nature such as mountain and ocean is good at health, so adults like to go and also childs like to go too. However, it is not the best place to spend weekend because activities are limited. We can do fishing, swimming at the ocean and climbing, camping on the mountain . It is all. By the way, when we go to abroad, we can enjoy more activities than others.
  First, we can eat various foods. Other country has different foods comparing with the Korea. For example, in Korea, bibimbap, bulgogi are the most famous foods, but in japan, sushi, udon, ramen are the famous foods. Actually we can eat these foods in Korea too. However, it is different taste between our foods. It may be changed by Korean's recipe and Korean's taste, so when we go to other country, we can enjoy their foods which is made by their traditional recipe. Furthermore, in my case, eating fruits which is not in the Korea was good experience too.
  Secondly, we can enjoy different culture. Every countries have different cultures. For instance, when I went to America, I didn't know tip, so I have to search about tip and I realize how to give some tips. At the first time, I can't understand about culture of tips because in korea, tips are contain in the price of foods. However, when I know that tips are price of service which is about how I satisfied for the service, I thought giving some tips is interesting culture. Enjoying other countries' culture will be good experience in our life.
  Lastly, we can see different views. When I went to Thailand, I went to traditional market. I shocked that market was on the river. I used boat to buy some items. Therefore, I ride the elephant for leisure.  Riding boat for buying some items and riding elephant are not seen on Korea, so I was very surprised. When we go to abroad, we can see different sights and enjoy that.
  In conclusion, going to other country will be make very good memories. Eating special foods, enjoying specific culture and seeing lots of view. With family or friends will be make experience which you can't forget, so I recommended that other country is a good place to spend the weekend with family and also friends."	4.5	4	3.5	12

We always say 'Look after corona!'. But now, government announced 'with-corona', so how about visiting some good place in Korea with your family or friends? Visiting other countries could be little dangerous, so I recommend you to visit beautiful place in Korea, especially my hometown Busan. 
    First, I think Busan is the best place to see beautiful oceans. There are Haeundae beach, Gwangali beach, and Songdo beach. These are all famous and each beach has really different attractive points. In Haeundae, there are so many buildings so that lights of buildings are beautiful at night. Also many festival are held in Haeundae beach, so lots of people visit there. In Gwangali beach, you can see colorful lights of Gwangan bridge. You can ride 'cable car' in Songdo beach. So if you want to see beaches, visit any beaches that I mentioned above. 
    Second, there are lots of delicious traditional foods of Busan. Only in Busan, you can eat 'ssaldduk.' It is a rice cake that is boiled with fish cake soup. And 'gukbab' is famous food of Busan. It is soup of pork and we usually eat this with rice. Also, because of Busan is near to ocean, there are lots of seafood like sushi, 'haemultang', 'mulhae'. There are so many famous traditional foods. I really recommend you to visit 'sijang' of Busan. You can try all of these foods. 
    Finally, Busan is famous of movie. Every year, many celebrity visit 'younghwa ei jundang' to enjoy festival of international movie. 'Younghwa ei jundang' is so famous that its structure is really scientific and beautiful. If you have some time, visit here, watch movies and lots of celebrity.
    In conclusion, you can see beautiful oceans, eat lots of delicious foods if you visit Busan. Make lots of good memory with your family or friends in Busan. I can obviously say that Busan will not disappointing you. "	4	3.5	3.5	11

"Many students consider all the day that where to spend their time in weekend. To reduce this time, students have to think about where is the best place to spend their weekend. There are advantages and disadvantages in places, but there are suitable place that fits student’s group. College street is good place to go and have fun with friends. Here are three reasons why college street is recommended.
    First, college street has a lot of places to eat. At least for eating, there are restaurants, street foods, cafe, etc. Moreover, these are not the only one in college street. Therefore, students can  choose 'where to eat' as well as 'what to eat and’ . For this reason, in college street, most students feel comfortable because they do not have to worry about how to get to the exact restaurant.
    Second, college street has places for playing. In college street, half of the building is students playground. The advantage of these places is that the places are made to fit to students in a college nearby. Therefore, those students feel free to walk and try to get inside any building. In Korea, their are PC room, coin sing practicing room and some sports rooms. In summary, students who came to the college street with their freinds do not get boring because their are lots of things  to enjoy. 
    The third reason is that students can meet people whose age is near 20. If students go to other streets, they will not satisfied with the atmosphere of that place. For example, there might be a young child who cry with very loud sound. This is special advantage that only college steet has. In this place, students are not bothered by young children or studnets under highschool. Therefore, students can enjoy without any bothering because of the atmosphere of college street.
    In the end, a college street is good place to spend time with friends because they have lots of things to do and it has its own atmosphere. Although there are people who do not like the college street because the place is too busy and annoying, it is just an opinion that one can get as a person. You may be good to know that this paragraph is also just one opinion to college street. I wish many students who are considering where to go can get the useful opinion and more and more people become positive to the college street."	5	4.5	4	13.5
2048	Recommend a good place to spend the weekend with family/friends. Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are many places that we can think easily to go travel. Beach is one of thoses places too. Therefore, this place could be not-special but there are three big reasons that beach is very good place to visit with friends of family.
   First, there are many contents to enjoy. For example, when I went to East Sea of Korea, there were some boats to ride, the place that people can make a barbecue, and the place that we can swim. There are some places to catch the fish and eat directly too. The various contents means that there are chances to come again or spend for several days. Although, the winter season that hard to swim in the ocean, there are many option with ice around the beach. Some beaches that have ice link or ice fishing these days. Therefore, the beach has many contents to play and I recommend beach even to the people who have gone before.
   Futhermore, all the generation can enjoy. From kids to elderly people, every one can go to beach and enjoy. If we go camping or mountain, kids and elderly people can feel very tired. And thoses places could be dangerous, because there are no safe gards. Even kids can enjoy the beach without swimming by fishing or make a sand castle. Unlikely other places, beach is very good and safe place to enjoy in a various group. 
    In addition, the cost is not expensive. For university students like me, the cost is very important. However, going beach doesn't cost a lot. The restraunt with fish around beach are cheap and there are some beaches that does paid at all. Less cost would be very good news for not only students but also family. Family should plan least 3~4 people, so the cost is important. However, beach is very freely with the cost problem.
   In conclusion, going beach is one of the best choice to spend good time with friends or family. All generation can join and enjoy, and there are many contents so they can come again and again. Even it doesn't cost a lot compare to other places. Fo these reasons, I really recomend beach to everyone who plan to go somewhere."	4.5	4	3.5	12

    First, you can have a great meal at restaurants. Both family and friends can enjoy meal and have some talks about tiring weekdays. Sharing  foods that you like with your family or friends make you feel pleasure. For example, I have a dinner with my family on every Sunday. We used to discuss about our privacy or worries during our meal such as how my study was going, what to do on next Tuesday or recommendation of menu of next day. These small talks make you feel comfortable and help your family be closer.

If you plan to go on a trip, it is really important to choose a place to make all family members feel nice. Seorak mountain is a e place for your trip. Although some people think that a journey to Seorak mountain is too boring, I believe that it is one of the best place to spend the weekend with family.
    First of all, hiking Seorak mountain itself has various advantages. These days, a lot of people including young people enjoy hiking because it is not only good for their health, but also provide them the feeling of achievement. As you walk through the nature with trees to reach the top of a mountain, you constantly exercise. Finally, you can look down the wide area nearby. Moreover, Seorak mountain is especially great. Since I've visitied Seorak mountain at least three times, I know that it is always beautiful for every season. Indeed, hiking Seorak mountain is beneficial as it makes your health, achievement, and beautiful experience better.
    In addition to hiking Seorak mountain, you can enjoy delicious foods near it. There are unique foods which you can't enjoy in other places. For example, Squid Sundae is my favorite one. As you can know from its name, it consists of squid. It tastes really new, but I believe almost everyone can enjoy it. On the other hand, there is one more food you should enjoy. It is Chicken Gangjeong. The food itself is very familiar, but the store has tremendous tradition. I recommend you to bring it to your home after buying it with boxes. Then you find that it still tastes amazing even if it is not hot. To sum up, you can enjoy both unique local foods and Chicken Gangjeong with long tradition near Seorak mountain.
    In conclusion, you can successfully enjoy the weekend with Seorak mountain. Why don't you travel to Seorak mountain this weekend with your family? It must be the best trip of this year."	5	5	4.5	14.5

"Usually, people spend their free time of the weekend with their family and friends. They need to spend time excited and happy because weekend is limited. However, if they hang out only their local or play in home, they cannot feel exciting easily. Because there are no new items to play and talk together. Therefore, a good place to spend the weekend is very important to spend time excited and I think Andong is a good place to spend the weekend with good people. Also some opponents believe that Andong is small city that population is only 130000 and there is no hot places and Everland. Maybe their beliefs are true about Andong, however, there are two big reasons that people should go to Andong to spend the weekend.
                     First of all, the small city and less population is not bad features to spend the weekend, it can be advantages to spend the weekend freely and relaxing. Opponents think that there is no hot places and Everland to spend the weekend, but it is not necessary to spend the weekend excited. All people in society get a lot of stress during their weekdays. They can also release their stress in hot place, but really necessary for them is relaxing at out of city and crowd. In Andong, there are a lot of places that there are less people like Hahoe Maeul, Byeongsan Seowon and museum of Dokrip. People can feel free and relaxing. As a result, to spend the weekend helpful to relax and feel excited, hot place is not necessary. People can feel relaxing and excited at less population.
                     The second reason is that there are a very long and Korean style culture and places. Andong has a long and proud history, so there are places and items to think about that. When Korea is under of Japan, a lot of people says about Dokrip and disagree about Japan. And we call people who says about Dokrip and disagree about Japan, Dokrip Undong-ga. However, in Andong, there are the most of Dokrip Undong-ga. Therefore, Korea made the museum of Dokrip in Andong. And Hahoe Maeul is also related Ryu SeungRyong. As a result, there are a lot of place to see the history of Andong and Korea.
                     To summarize, Andong is small country and less population. It is true, but it is not necessary to spend the weekend with good people. Andong has many places to see and talk together, so I recommend to travel Andong."	3.5	3	3	9.5

Therefore, our family go to a good place where we can relax our mind. As my parents, many people who lives in cities are so tired because of their own work. In my opinion, they have to relax in the weekend to get some energy which makes them wake up in monday morning. For these reason, I recommend the Younggwang coast road for the place that tired people get relax in the weekend with family or friends. I have three reason why the Younggwang coast road is a good place to spend the weekend with family or friends.
  First of all, the way to go the Younggwang coast road has not much traffic jam. People who lives in cities always get stress because of traffic jam. When they go to popular place in the weekend, they must get stress by the traffic jam. Furthermore, in the weekend, there are more cars in the road, it makes your condition more tired. Maybe you cannot wake up in monday morning. Therefore, the way to go the Younggwang coast road doesn't have traffic jam. Moreover, the way to go the Younggwang coast road is so beautiful countryside, you can relax and breath fresh air.
  The second reason that the Younggwang coast road have beautiful ocean view which is recommended by government. Younggwang coast road are located in west of Korea, the west ocean is much clean then east ocean or south ocean. You can enjoy the clean blue ocean which reflect the sunshine very clearly. Moreover, if you drive the Younggwang coast road when sunset, you will feel as same as you are driving above the sky. I cannot forget this experience, when I feel tired of my studying, I always think this experience as blueprint. Therefore, I want to recommend you to feel this experience as I experienced when sunset.
  Finally, you can enjoy fresh sea food which you cannot enjoy in city. When you go to the Younggwang coast road, you can enjoy sea food in very cheap price. The average price of sea food are expensive in city then the Younggwang, because of delivery price. Moreover, you can eat sea food which are catched right now, it means this is more fresh and more delicious. You can have some energy to work by delicious sea food that you cannot enjoy in city.
  To summarize, I recommend the Younggwang coast road as three reasons, the way to go the Youngwang coast road has not traffic jam,  it have beautiful ocean view and have very fresh and delicious sea food. My dream is that the many people know the Younggwang coast road. Furthermore, I hope that many people get relax, treat their mind by watching beautiful view and get some sea food energy at the Younggwang coast road.

  Nowadays, weekend is significant and meaningful days for people because they can get a rest freely. So, many people are trying to spend their weekend meaningfully with their familiy or friends. However, it is hard to choose what to do, especially where they go. In my opinion, park can be a good choice for place to spend their weekend. Some opponents might not prefer to go to a park because there are too many people, dogs and sometiems there are too loud. But I strongly recommend a park as a place to spend the weekend with your important people for three reasons.
  First of all, park is a best place to take physical activties such as excercise, workout or jogging. These physical activities make people happier by reducing their stress, and they also make people more friendly.

"As the Covid-19 pandemic is getting better, people are planning for travel or visiting sites. Since we have stayed at home for the social distancing to minimize the danger of infections, most people tend to hang out with friends or leaving their home for a long term. In Korea, many people talk that there are beautiful places like the GyeongJu cafe street, or Incheon, and they are near to visit and good places for spending weekends. But among these best places for spending their time, especially Haeundae in Busan is enough to be recommended for spending the weekend with family and friends.
    First, there are many attractions and sites for enjoying and making unforgettable memories. When you plan for traveling famous sites, what is the first place that you think as the most important point? In my case, I always search for attractions there that we can make joyful memories beacause after the travel is over, pictures and joyful memories are the only things that remain in our minds. In Haeundae, the first attraction that we can enjoy is the cable car. This is not a common cable car, it has the transparent floor that we can feel that float or fly over the sea while we go across the sea. Also it takes quite long time, so we can take pictures and talk about jokes or each people's own stories watching beautiful scenes. In addition to the cable car, the skywalk is also recommendable attractions for making unforgettable memories. The skywalk is the small road or bridge that we can walk along with the side of the beach. It also has transparent floors and walls, so we can enjoy thrills and stare at the sea without any obstacles.
    After enjoying all attractions, we must fill our hungry stomaches with delicious foods. And there are various foods near Haeundae. Since this is the beach, we can find various sea foods easily near Haeundae such as raw fish, boiled crabs, and maeuntang. Since we go their with our friends and familes, we can also enjoy drinks with this delicious foods. Not only sea foods, but also noodles or beef and porks famous for young generations can be finded near Haeundae. Many young people look for Busan and Haeundae in holidays, various foods targeting on young generations such as hottuck or pulled porks also are selled there.
   Third, it has one of the most beautiful night scene in Korea. After the sun going down, many light bulbs on the bridge and hotels make us delightful. As we did in the attractions, we can also take pictures to share or upload on the SNS. In my case, when I visited Haeundae, I was fascinated with the beautiful night scenes there. Besides, I was so busy to remain them as pictures using my phone. Not only remaining beautiful scences, but also took picture with my friends making Busan as the background of our images.
  In conclusion, the purpose of spending the weeking with family or friend is making unforgettable memories and enjoying that moments. Haeundae is the best place for this purpose since is has vaious attractions, delicious foods, and beautiful night scences. We can take pictures and accumulate memories by visiting famous sites, sharing foods, and staring at the horizon of the sea. Then I strongly recommend you to consider Haeundae for the travel."	5	5	5	15

Because of covid-19, people are tired about staying at home for 2 years. Thus, they want to find and go to place that can make valuable memories with their family or friends.

Therefore, Han river is a nice place to go whenever.
     Finally It is easy to go Han river park. The Han river is located in the middle of Seoul. Because Seoul is the Capital of Korea, there are lots of transformations. Therefore, if you do not have a your own car, you can go Han river park easily by using a subway or bus. Consequently, Han river is a good place to go and spent time because of easy way to go.

2057	Recommend a good place to spend the weekend with family/friends. Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"We have lots of free time on weekend. And it is good chance to increase friendship or love among family which decreased on weekday because of lack of time by each's work. To use this chance well, we must think about 'how to use this time?'. And following question of this is 'where is good place to spend the weekend with family/friends?' (Because when, who, why are already answered. And what, how are dependent on the place to spend time.) On this  essay, I will recommend a good place to spend the weekend with family/friends to show the reason of decision.

First of all, we should think about 'place which we can go' with brainstorming. And I will check the conditions, and I will except whose condition is not satisfied. I already made the list. Please check it. [Amusement park, restaurant, quiet park, theater, museum, and other famous place which have some characteristics (For instance, Insadong, Jeon-ju han-ok country, Kyung-ju are included.)] I tried to make list of various place.

And now, I suggest the conditions of the place which is good to spend the weekend with family and friends. First, it must not make us tired. On weekday, we already use our power and energy for work and study. So actually we don't have enough energy to enjoy the place. Second condition is, it must make us feel good with all sence. For friendship and love, we need satisfying feel with 5 sence. Because which make the amount of friendship and love increase is memory, and the memory which remain for a long time is experience with various sence.
 
Now, Let's think about where is not fitted with condition I suggested. By first condition, amusement park and famous place are excepted. Amusement park make us tired and famous place on other location is too far and there are several things which we have to see. It is not good place to go on weekend, but it is good place to go on vacation. And with second condition, I recommend museum as good place to go with friends and family. Because there are fluent to make experience with all sence.

In conclusion, I recommanded good place to go with friends and family on weekends. I make 2 conditions and I introduced them. And at result, the museum is determined to the good place. But important fact is, the conditions can be different with people. Some people would like to go place which make us tired. And other some people would like to invite friends to their home. So I recommand that use this method with your priority."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
2058	Recommend a good place to spend the weekend with family/friends. Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Places to Visit on the Weekends
          Our body needs to rest and relax every now and then. Going to new places and experiancing new things are the main ways our body can relax. To do this and have the full relaxation experiance we will need a longer break time from work. Although it is impossible to totally detach someone from work, it is possible to take the mind off of things while experiancing something fun. Thus I believe weekends are good time to have  vacations. To experiance this relaxation completely having vacation with loved one is recommended. In my opinion, there are three main places to experiance great weekend.
          First, visiting the beach is a good place to spend on the weekend. The ocean breath, the fresh air, and the experiance of exploring ones creativity by building sand castels are the main reasons for this. In addition, people also get vitamin D from the sun and also make new friends at the beach. This inturn will create a better experiance and add to the relaxation process.  Thus, going to the beach is a means to relax, meet new people, and get Vitamin D.
          Second, the cinema is a good place to spend on the weekend. The cinema is a good place to watch movies and experiance life in other person's shoes. For example, a person might choose to watch an action movie filled with scenes like jumping out of airplanes, this enables the person to experiance what it is like to skydive without actually paying the expensive fees of skydiving or risking his/her life. In addition, experiancing the movies with a loved one increases the bond between the two. This is because of the feeling of experiancing the scenes together. Therefore, going to the cinema is a means to experiance life in other people's view and also strengthen the bond with a loved one.
          Finally, the art gallery is a good a good place to spend on the weekend. The art gallery is a place where creativity of people can be observed. One can experiance the emotion and culture of the people by looking at the their art. This is because the feeling of people and their culture is reflected through the colors and design of their art. Although you might not be the one who drew the art, you will still experiance the creativity. This in turn will create ones own definition of the art which will create new point of view. Sharing ones own defintion of this art would be a good way to strengthen the bond with a loved one. Thus going to the art gallery is a means to increase ones creativity and admire people's cultre and emotions.
          In conclusion, going to the beach, the cinema, or the art gallery is the best way to spend the weekend with a loved one. In the beach one can experince the fresh air, the sand, and get vitamin D. In the cinema, one can experiance life in the actor's point of view, and also strengthen the bond with a loved one because of this experiance. In art gallery, one can experiance the culture and emotions of each other creating a strong bond. Thus, I believe going to these places and experiancing these things makes our experiances more pleasurable."	4.5	5	4.5	14
2059	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think the best hobby for college students is sports. It has quite abstract meaning but sports is one of the best hobby not only for students, but also for everyone. Specially for KAISTian, many students should study a huge amount of knoldege from various class. So, they spent many time in front of their desk, and it makes students very unhealthy. They need to move their body properly at least 1 hour per day.  This is why students need sports. Aslo, everybody has different interests. Luckly, there are so many kinds of sports they can choose. For my case, I'm not good at sports which my peers usally do. It makes me not to do any sports. However, after I entered the college, I joined the climbing club. Climbing was very fit to me, and it makes me to enjoy the sports again. There so many different sports are exist, so students find at least one sport that makes him exciting. Another reason is that sports need less money compare to other hobbies. Sports are usally free to enjoy. For example, jogging is absolutely free. Students  just need the place to jogging neer the school. Other hobbies like watching a movie, or play a guitar are need money like movie tickets fee or guitar price. So, I recommend the hobby, ""sports""."	1.5	2	2	5.5
2060	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think good hoby for college student is exercising. I thingk all kinds of exercising is good hoby for college students. There are severeal reason why I think, so I start on by one.
 First, college students don't have much chance to exercise. In high school, there was PE class. So, students had to exercise during that class. However, in college, there were no execise class. So, usually many colleage students don't exercise after graduating high school. So, If exercising will be there hobby, they can have much more chance to exercise.
 Second, college students don't have much time to exercise. Because, almost every college students ( especially KAIST students) are very busy. So, they don't have much time to exercise. If their hobby were not exercise, they have to spend time to do their hobby and exercise both. And I think that is impossible, because students were too busy. So, If their hobby is exercising, they dont't have to spend more time to do their hobby and exercise. Becasue their hobby equals exercising! 
 Last, exercising is very healthful hobby. There are so many hobbies. Playing computer games, watching movies, listening music, etc.... However, there are only few hobbies that is helpful for their body. And, exercising is extremly healthful for their body. So, I think exercising is very good hoby for their body.
 In conclusion, college students don't have much time and chance to exercise. So exercising is very good hoby for colleage students. Also, exercising is very healthful hobby.So, because of these three reasons, I think exercising is very good hobby for college students."	2.5	2	1.5	6
2061	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think playing computer games is a good hobby for college students. 
First, we can make many friends with games. In my case, I like games. Especially, League of Legends (LOL). I often play LOL with my old friends, and sometimes I play with my college friends who i met in 2021. Sometimes, computer games will be a talking subject. We can talk about games, and play style or liking champions. 
Second, we can release our stress. In college, there have lots of works, and studies. It may be become stress to our college students. Games will help our students. When we play games, we become happy and our stress will disappear. Game is a great material for lossing stress.
Lastly, we already prepare to play computer games. Most of college students have own computer like notebook or desktop. We can meet computer games easily because we have own PC. Instead of PC, we need only our hands and head. So, it is comfortable to have fun with games.
Therefore, playing computer games helps making new friends, releasing stress, and only PC is needed. I think more than a half people play games in college. Game is a great hobby in college, especially more in KAIST. So, if you don't playing games yet, why don't you start now? Thank you for reading."	2	2	1	5

College students are good customer for bar. So near college there are lots of bars.
If your hobby is about coktail you can easily enjoy it.

2064	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are a lot of hobbies in the world. And college students also enjoy many things. Due to COVID-19, I feel that many people in nowadays like to watch Netflix the most. But it is not active and just watching something will make people to be coach potatos. So, I want to recommand somthing active and  also safe. That is riding a bike. 
First of all, We can be fresh when we ride a bike. We can feel windy and sunny weather. Ride a bike is a good hobby because not only one people can enjoy, but also enjoying together can will be better. You can race with your friends, and you can feel free when we ride a bike alone. To do this, you will be heathier so you can do work more efficiently.
Second, It also be a traffic tool. We can go ‘Sung-Sim-Dang’ with our bike, and we can go picnic too. To go anywhere what you want with bicycle, we also safe our money. Fortunately, most of our campus are not rough. There are no upper-or-lower side. So people who do not ride bicycle well can also ride a bike well.
Lastly, It is safe from COVID-19. Inside the rule of ‘How to depend COVID-19’, when someone who is in danger from corona virus have to go to check with PCR, he or she can use their bike. Riding a bike is outdoor hobby, but it is most safe hobby in whole of outdoor hobby.
For these reason, I strongly recommand riding a bike. I hope that more students in KAIST learn how to ride a bike!"	2	2	1	5
2065	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think good hobby for college students is reading books or news, volunteering, sports.
First, the reason why I think reading books or news is good hobby for college students is they are the most important people in future for society, and country. They are interested in and have many information about their major. They need to improve their society. So I think college students have to get attention to their society issue by news or books. 
Second, volunteering also would be a good hobby. When I volunteer, I felt lots of emotions. Volunteer may be really good experience in life. They can feel emotion of people who are living hardly. So when they are going to improve their society, this experience may influence a lot. 
Third, sports can make healthy body for them. I think sports also make good relationship with other people. It improves cooperation, self-esteem, and lots of other things. I think sport team is a small society. We can also learn society through sports. 
On the other hand, I think there is no 'good' hobby. Any hobby that they enjoy and get happy emotion are 'good' hobby for them. So my real answer of this question is 'Good hobby for college students is what they enjoy.' Especially, my hobby is singing songs and playing 'league of legend'. I felt exciting through this hobby. So I think these hobbies are the best hobby! I hope college students could make lots of hobbies and experience a lot. "	3	3	2.5	8.5
2066	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" I think every sports is good hobby for all of college students.
 It’s because activity sports like soccer, basketball, table tennis and so on are effective at enhancing our health and for side effect, we can use our energy so that we can sleep at early night. That is, if I drank a cup of coffee to get my concentration and do a work out with my hobby, I don’t have to worry about the early sleep. When the time’s close to midnight, I get too exhausted to stay awake.
 Second, it’s also really effective at conserving my body’s posture. I felt this is true during my work out-days. Almost 6 months from January to July, I have done the work out 5 hours a week. And I felt my body’s posture is well-positioned. I think this is because the muscles of my body is get bigger and my bones next to muscle are also well-positioned. Because of this chain effect, I can get focused on my posture even in working or studying. So If I have a hobby in sports, I can expect I can get this useful and helpful side effect.
 Lastly, if I have any sports hobby, I am able to attend the sports club. In sports club, of course we can easily get the person who want to play sports games with me. And playing with club members, we can even expect the friendship with members. I think this is really good side effect because I attended here to have fun with sports game, but there’s other entertainment by getting close with club members. 
 For this three reasons, having hobby of sports is very good choice in college. I heard that, in germany, about 70% of adult have there own sports club and it found that doing sports is helpful of enhancing work efficiency and friendship. Then, why don’t you get any sports for your hobby? Thank you for your reading."	2.5	1.5	2	6
2067	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Playing instrument is a good hobby

 Students in KAIST study a lot with mathematics and other science subjects. In my opinion, playing instrument is a good hobby to college student. For example my best hobby is to play guitar and I really satisfy with it. Then, I'll tell you serveral reason that I recommend this hobby
 First, to have a hobby that didn't do before is a very good hobby. Students in college, especially in KAIST, they don't have lots of time to experience music since their childhood. Students in college would study a lot of things that they are in major. So, if those students have a hobby like solving the mathematic problems or reading a book about science, they could think those hobby as a work or a hard things. Even if they like to study science, just studying for science all day can be stressful. So, playing instrument can be a new thing for them.
 Second, most of the people likes music. I have never seen a person who hates music. There are many people who hates specific area of music, but nobody hates all the music in the world. It means, there would be at least one instruments that person could play with his favorite music. And it means that not only him but also others would like the music. So, friends would like to listen to music that played by theirselves. It could help college students to have a nice campus life.
 Third there are no limit in this hobby. If you learn to play a favorite song with piano, then what can you do next? You could learn to play another song easily. So, after learning piano, you could play all the songs that use piano. Even nowdays, there are lots of videos in Youtube or other video platform, so it is easy to learn a new music. And, you could play it anywhere. Some of college students don't have a lot of time to use time in hobby. But, after learning instrument such as guitar, we could practice at home, or domitory room. After join in music club, he could play it in club room too. There are many instrument can be handled like guitar, plute or violine. It would help college students to maintain their hobby and not to giveup.
 Those three reasons are why I recommend to have a hobby with playing instrument. For someone, it could be a hard thing to learn it at a first time. But once you start it, you couldn't stop it because of the acheivement. I know that you would never regret of it because, I'm already enjoining it."	3.5	3	3	9.5
2068	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Reading Books
  In my opinion, the best hobby for college students is reading books. For three reasons why I think it is important and a good hobby. First, they can get lots of information and experiences by books. College students don't have enough experience because they meet the new society which is really different from school. By reading many different kinds of books, their brain can grow with knowledge more easily and fast. Second, book is the way students raise calmness and feel healing. The age of college students, generally 20-25, easily changes their feeling upside-down. Also, sometimes they feel nervous and fear about their future. Book would make them more calm and safe, and also book helps them to feel free to imagine themselves. Finally, book can make new friends or relationship for college students. People who have the common interests can make friends faster than others. Reading books is also common interest and it can be really important to your good relationships. For getting information, raising calmness, and making new friends, I'd like to recommend reading books to college students. "	1.5	1.5	1.5	4.5
2069	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"For these days, it is hard for high school students to make their own hobbies since they have a plenty of works to do. Many people think that they can get hobbies or clubs when they enter colleges. However, there are various types of hobbies so that you would have hard time to choose your hobby. you can enjoy other things  such as band or magic, I believe that one of the best hoobies for college students is sports. There are several reasons why I recommend sports for college students. 
To begin with, sports make you healty and enthusiastic. As high school students have no time to work out, they may have severe physical problems like getting fat or not enough muscles. I believe that sports such as soccer and just jogging improve your physical abilities in colleges. For example, my friend was poor at playing basketball in high school. But, he can be best player and also gain confidence about sports by participating in college basketball club. Like these, sports can affect your skills and confidence.
On top of that, you can meet many college friends by doing activites. Doing sports which require partner or competitors  can make you chances to meet other college students having same hobby. For me, I had trouble with friends problems because it was more complicated to meet friends than when I was in high school. But, playing sports like tennis helped me to meet our college students without other risks. I actually meet or get contact with college friends in my sports club. It is also easy to contact with them play sports. Thanks to sports, I am able to make several friends in college. 
To sum up, I think working out is a suitable hobby for college students because of their performances and friends. I hope that you can achieve your goals and enjoy your college life to have hobbies like sports activities. "	2.5	1.5	2.5	6.5

Maybe it can be playing the piano, playing computer games, or reading books. Like these, we have very various hobbies. Then, what is a good hobby? Some may think playing computer games is fantastic hobby, but some other people think it's not good. How can we divide lots of hobbies into two groups - good hobbies and bad hobbies? Today, I'd like to talk about a good hobby. Especially, I'd like to give you my opinion about a good hobby for college students as one college student.
   First of all, a good hobby makes college students feel happy. The main purpose of your hobby is to make you feel relaxed. Let's suppose that you don't want to waste your time and read books everyday, but you feel terrible about that. This can't be a good hobby. Enjoying your hobby gives you some energy to do your jobs. You don't have to think that you're wasting your precious time.
   Second, a good hobby makes college students develop themselves. As I said before, happiness is really important. However, it doesn't mean that you must pursue your happiness only. Even though your hobby is playing computer games, you can gain many things from it. You can learn how to regulate your anger or utilize your brain in a short time. It's not that important to select a kind of hobby. Really important thing is to try to develop yourself with your hobby.
   To sum up, a good hobby is a hobby that makes college students feel happy and develop themselves. Is your hobby a good hobby? Although it isn't, you don't have to change your hobby itself. You can just change other things such as your mind and time limit of your hobby. Why don't you make your bad hobby a good hobby? You can live your life only once and a good hobby can change your life at all."	3	3	3.5	9.5

                                First hobby is reading books. Reading books is very good and pure hobby. It gives many advantages to us. When we read books, we need to concentrate about that contents for several hours. So, we can improve our concentration and reading skills. And we can get some information about that, our knowledges are more increase. Also, read books repeatedly, the reading speed will be faster. Our reading speed is improved. College students need to read their major books or other books for writing essays. At that time, students need to have reading skills (for catching important information), large knowledge, and reading speed (for finish early). Like this reason, reading books is a good hobby for college students.
                               Second hobby is exercising by any activities. For college life, we have to study hard. When I was young, teachers and adults say to children, ""We study by health ability. (or hip)"" It means that if we don't enough have health ability, we can't study. (hip means we always sit and use energy when we study) So, for college students, health ability is important. But, we don't have P.E class, so we need to exercise ourselves. When we exercise, we shouldn't wish that get health ability at once. We need to exercise repeatedly. It is very hard, so in our free time, we make our hobby to exercise, that is very useful and good hobby.
                              I think above two hobbies are good hobby for college students. I want to act some of them."	3	2.5	2.5	8

For KAIST, there are many students who play League Of Legend.  Furthermore, there are many kinds of hobby. If I have to know what is a good hobby, I have to make some specific guideline. To be a good hobby, in my opinion, there are four things to consider, healthy, sociability, fun, and cost. I will tell you about why these are important things that to choose hobby.
   First of all, most of college students are not have a lot of money. For example, they likes golf, it will spend a lot of money for hobby. So, we have to consider the cost firstly.
   Second, we have to consider sociability. The best way to make friend is having same hobby. For example, I like to play basketball. So I can enter basketball club and meet friends who like playing basketball. College students have to meet many friends, so the sociability is important.
   Thire, we have to consider healthy. Most of college students are young, but, if they graduate school, they have to work for their own life. If they are not healthy, they cannot work well at workplace. So, having health hobby is important.
    Lastly, we have to consider fun. This is most important thing to consider. Good hobby gives our fun. We have to rest for enjoying hobby. If hobby is not fun, it cannot call as hobby.
    I want to recommend which hobby that gives you sociability, healthy, fun, and cost effect. It is basketball. You can play basketball at any park. Also, it will make you healthy more than now. When you play baksetball with your friends, you can be more friendly before playing basketball. I hope you to find your own good hobby. Thank you."	3	3	2.5	8.5
2073	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Have you think about what hobby is good or bad? I think many of you haven't minded about this topic deeply. But, It is important to know what hobby is good or bad. Some hobbies can make you feel bad, lost confidence. For example, computer games. In Korea, many people enjoy computer games such as League of Legends, PUBG or Cart Rider. It is very fun. But if you start to play it more and more, you might be feel that you lost your life. Because they are time-consumed, hard to stopping.
  So, I want to introduce  a good hobby which I recommend to you. It is 'basketball'. Basketball is a kind of sports playing with ball. Two teams are playing and each team includes 3 or 5 players. The goal is to get more points then opposite team by putting ball into a basket. Anyway, why I recommend basketball? There are three reasons. First, It is team sports. Can you win basketball matches without cooperating with other members? I make sure, you 100% can't. To get points, you should interplay whith other members such as pass, screen play(which blocks defender using body), switch(changing defenders with my member). You can't win the game without your members. It means, by playing basketball, you can grow your leadership, friendship and membership. Second, It makes you healthier. Basketball is one of the most energetic sports in the world. When the offense and defense are changed, you should move to opposite half-courts. Yes, you should keep running during matches. Also there are many types of basketball skills so that you should practice hard. With playing basketball, your health will become healthier. Last, contrast to computergaems, It doesn't take a lot of time. Because of hard exercise, you can't play basketball for a long time. So you can keep your lifes with basketball.
  I hope that you guys like my recommendation and accept the reasons is reasonable. If you want to play basketball, contact me. I'm a big fan of basketball, so I can help you. Thanks to reading my article."	2	1.5	2	5.5
2074	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Recently, COVID-19 spreaded all over world, and people had to stay at home for a long time. To spend thier time, people tried to find new hobbies or works such as starting 1-person broadcasts, home training, etc. Also collegue students started to find their new hobby as their colleges decided to have online-courses not to attend physically to their collegues, and have a lot of free time at home. I also suffered that problems and tried to find new activities not to be bored. And from now on, I'm going to recommend several hobbies that colleage students can enjoy easily.

  First, making some cocktails at home is one of good hobbeis for college students. Especially for freshmen of collegue, most of them have a lot of interesting on drinking but their were only few moments to try them. So I recommend you to try some cocktails at home. There are two reasons why I recommend it. First, we can enjoy drinking without go outside or hanging with friends which mean that we can keep government's regulations to prevent COVID-19. Second, since online video flatforms are activated we can easily find some guidelines to start making cocktails. But what we have not to forget is that we have to focus on ""Making"", not ""Drinking"". Too much drinks induce health problems, just enjoy making cocktails and fresh experiences.
  Second, playing musical instruments can be one of good hobbies for college students. People think that all musical instruments are expensive and hard to start it without teachers or guide books. In fact, hurdles to start new instruments is being lower then past. We can easily learn them from Youtube platform, 101 Classes which is website that we can learn various hobbies or techniques such as playing musical instruments, drawing, programming and etc. So why I recomment playing musical instruments? We can calm down and get rid of some stresses playing beautiful melodies. Of course that it would be hard at first. For my case, every vacations I try to learn new instruments to find new experiences and feelings. Not every process of learning is fun and excited, but after practiced some basic skills I could play several songs what I wanted to play. So if you keep making efforts, you will start to enjoy them soon.

  At first peroid of the pandemic, governments demanded residents to keep social distancing, so many educational organizations were busy to construct online-classes system and rescheduled school enducation plans. But these days, almost every systems are well organized using various programs and platforms, also companies started to support online-classes for general people who want to find their new hobbies. To sum up, you can consider making cocktails or playing new musical instruments, also you may use online-courses sites to find new hobbies. I hope you to find interesting hobbies or studying to step-up your abillities."	4	3.5	3	10.5

Since I came here KAIST, I learned playing guitar for my hobby. And I found a lot of benefit during playing guitar. So I'm going to introduce about positive points of guitar.
  First of all, it is helpful to you to take care of your stress level. While playing guitar, you must be concentrated on just music. By concentrating on music you can forget anything make your feeling blue. And success of challange for the hard riff can give you happiness. And the ratio of melodies can improve your mathmatical sense, also ability of memorization by memorize a whore song.
Next, it is good to make social relationship. Many of musical instrument can apeal to other, but I think guitar is the best. Guitar is easy to carry and play melody or bass with just one instrument. And there are not many people can play guitar so you can easily seem profecinal to others. And it is good to make excited atmosphear. You can easily carrt it to trip, and play many songs their. 
Finally, you can earn money. When you can play guitar quite well, you can be a session for band or singer. In club of Hong-Dae, there are many unknown singers you can play guitar for them and get some money. Or you can post your video on Youtube. AZ guitarist, my favorite guitar youtuber, played guitar for hobby. But now he write guitar riff for band and remake a song on youtube and communicate with subscribers and make money on youtube. Many hobbies costs a lot, but playing guitar can look forwad to payback.
For these reason I recommand to you play guitar."	2	1	1.5	4.5
2076	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Hello. Guys. Do you have any hobbies? I think someone has lots of hobbies and someone has no hobbies. To have hoobies is your mind but, if you don't have hobbies I recommend to make your hobby. Today, I'm going to talk about hobbies for college students, why am I recommend to have a hobby and what  hobby ia a good for you.
     To have your own hobby has many adventages. I think many high school students of Korean have no hobbies because of study. So I understand you who is freshman in Korean college have no hobbies. but, I think you experience a situation that you study all day. At that time, you may be tired, stressful, and hate study. So you should have some hobbies to relax and reduce stresses. Also, hobbies may make your another dreams or new friends through hobbies activity. For these reasons I think there are no reasons not to have hobbies.
     Then what hobbies is a good choice for college students. The best Choice is having club about you like. Because, if you have club, you can make new friends and enjoy activities steadily with your friends. Among lots of clubs, sports clubs is the best best choice. If you have sports club, there are so many adventsges including before I talked. You can make your hobbies to play sports, exercise makes you more healthy, and you can enjoy and learn sports that you like . So, To enter sports club means that you have hobbies and you can be more healthy. I recommend to have sports club.
     If you have another interseting like music, dancing orsomething , clubs about it is also a good choice.  But although you don't have thought about sports, because of reasons I talked How about apply sports club?"	1.5	2	1	4.5
2077	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"To answer this question, I think that they must be solved that the questions, ""What is the purpose of hobby?""
Let's answer to that question. What is the purpose of hobby? I think it has two main purposes. First, people wants to clear their working-studying stress to do their hobby. Second, simultaneously, people wants to get some accomplishments which could not be get by their main job to do their hobby. So in my opinion, good hobby is that satisfies those two conditions.
Then we should answer the following question. ""What is the main job of college student?"" It is 'study'. And this study is focusing the subjects of their major. 
Therefore, the students don't want to be a ""studier"". For example, a student who is major in mechanical engineering doesn't want to be a person who is studying mechanical engineering continuously for their life. He or she may wants to be a scholar or business man/woman. They dream about their future, they dream about that they make an accomplishment on their future job.
So I think that the good hobby is ""Fun activity for their future dream"". If one want to be a scholar, the writing can be a good hobby for him or her. Because the essential skill of scholar is writing to write articles, and it is hard to learn from university education. In other case, If one want to be a programmer, doing new project like ""making business"" can be a good hobby. (Although many people says that enterpreneur must dedicate for their work unlike hobby) Doing a self-made project to solve their own problem will be a good experience(career) for them.
In my case, my dream is to be a management strategic consultant. And it is so sad fact that KAIST is concentrated on science and technology. So, to make my dream true, I am polishing my logical thinking and communication skill with participating session as a member of a management studying club.
I think that college students will be more happy when enjoying their good hobby. Thank you for reading!"	2	2	2	6
2078	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Students in college could have multiple good hobbies. For hobbies to be considered good they should either aid in self development or help the society in some way. For college students good hobbies could mainly be classified into three groups hobbies in research, hobbies in clubs and hobbies in academics. 
           In hobbies for research, students could participate in a lab.s under the guidance of a professor. The students can either be part of the experiment or be part of the researchers. Being part of the experiment is simple students will be asked to follow certain procedures depending on the guidlines of the lab. they are participating in. For example, If the expeiment is taking place in biology lab. where the researchers are measuring EEG, students will be asked to remove their jewlery and take a sit on a chair and relax while the reseachers measure stundents brain wave activities. On the other hand if students are a part of the resarch, they will work hand in hand with the professor conducting experiments. For example, If the research is taking place in computer science lab. students will be asked to develop software that gives a desired output. The students will then look into the ""open source"" and find codes that might be usefull in their reseach, they will then modify the code and subject it to test cases until they get the desired output.
          In hobbies in clubs, students usually apply for the clubs that they are passionate about.  After the application process is over the club leaders hand pick students that they think showed the most passion among the people who applied. After this process is over the students usually work on group activites with the club members. For example if a student has applied and is accepeted in the music club, he/she will have the chance to sing with the club members and have a good time. In addition he/she could have the chance to perform to the whole campus.
          In hobbies in academics, students usually spend their time mainly in libraries. their dorms or with professors, either studying for or asking questions about the courses. For example, a student who is currently taking the physics course could watch a youtube video in his dorm about how to caluclate the speed of light.
          In conclusion, good hobbies are hobbies that help in either self development or help the society in some way. In college good hobbies can be mainly classified into three main groups hobbies in research which help students understand how to work hand in hand with professors and undestand how to conduct experiments, hobbies in clubs which help students explore their passion and have the chance to show thier passion to the world,and hobbies in academics which help the students understand more about the courses."	4	4	3.5	11.5
2079	Recommend a good place to spend the weekend with family/friends. Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"These days, since many people are exhausted because of the busy daily life, they enjoy going short trip to good place to spend the weekend with their family or friends. However, choosing a good destination for every trip is another tired process because there are lots of attractive places in the Korea. Although there are many tourist destinations, I want to assert that Songjeong beach in Busan for the best place that anyone can get one of the most impressive memories with their family and friends in the weekend.
    First of all, there are many attractive activity to enjoy. Since the Songjeong beach is quite beautiful, just watching the wave, people, and ships with lying on the comfortable chair can be the best resting. Moreover, there is a long road along the sealine near the beach, so the visitors can enjoy wonderful scenary while driving the road slowly. In addition, the Songjeong beach is not that far from the amusement park and waterpark, they are able to go to there and enjoy the attractions. Also, the wave of Songjeong beach is quite appropriate to surf, and there are many shops for surfers. The shops provide the one-day class for surfing, too. Therefore, watching the scenary of beautiful beach and have a enjoyable activity with the family or friends is possible at the Songjeong beach.
    Second, visitors can eat various delicious foods near the beach. There is a popular toast store at just front of the beach, Moon Toast. It is very famous of amazing toast with lots of vegetables, fried egg, cheese, and the special sauce. Many people comes to Songjeong beach to eat the toast and a lot of TV program introduced it. In addition, the visitors can enjoy Busan traditional food such as seaweed soup, pork soup, and fresh raw fish with cheap price near the beach. Since many people are literally living near Songjeong beach, the commercial system is well-developed. Thus, there are large amount of good restaurants with delicious Busan traditional food, and enjoying the good food could be one of the big happiness for the weekend.
    Lastly, Songjeong beach is queit enough to spend the weekend privately. Because Busan is very popular tourist destination, there are too many people and cars in some beaches in Busan such as Haeundae and Gwangalli. The beaches are too loud and complex to enjoy the short trip with family or friends. In contrast, the Songjeong beach is smaller and less famous than Haeundae and Gwangalli, which means the weekend trip can be more private. If someone want the quiet place to get some rest out of the complex city and lots of people, going Songjeong beach will be the best choice.
    In conclusion, I want to recommend Songjeong beach for the best place to spend the weekend with family or friends. There are many tourist attractions and delicious restaurant. Also, the Songjeong beach is not that noisy and complex than other famous beaches in Busan. If someone are finding the quiet, but enjoyable place to spend the weekend with the family or friend, I think choosing Songjeong beach for the destination will give them the best memorable experiences."	5	5	4	14

Some people think going a trip is good to spend time with others. Traveling is exciting and can be a good experience, but it needs a lot of things to prepare and money. So, I recommend to share simple interests with family or friends to spend weekend together. There are some activities to enjoy with them.
First, it is good to go theater and watch movies together. When watching movies together, they can get more impression and keep more long time. Also, you can talk your opinion about movies that watch together with family or friends. It makes not only the relationship closer but also to think various sides.

In addition, with family or friends, they can have competition and fun time. Bowling and ping-pong are suitable place for these purpose.

    A mountain is a natural place. First, spending the weekend at the mountain is environment friendly activity.  We can enjoy many things without destroying nature things.

    Furthermore, we can talk about family and friends long time when we climb mountain together. These days, talking time with other people is decreasing because of many digital devices. For instance, if we don't have a computer or a cell phone,  we  usually talk with family when we eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner. But, we often do not talk with family  when we eat because we use a cell phone in this time.  So, these days, we need to increase talking time. When we climb mountain together, we talk about many different things in our life because we distant with many works.

Sinchon's advantage is that you can enjoy such a variety of entertainment in one place.
  Second, there is a lot to eat. For instance, if you want to eat a lot at a low price, you can go to an unlimited refill restaurant. It's a place where many students go, but the advantage is that you can also eat high-quality meat these days. If you want to enjoy it slowly, there are high-end restaurants. The price may be a little expensive, but it will be a satisfactory meal.  There are many desserts to eat, too. If you want to eat cool food, you can eat shaved ice or ice cream. Also, if you want to drink slowly, you can go to the various cafes mentioned above. Because cafes are large, the types of drinks are quite diverse.

" Many people usually work hard in weekdays and they get free time in the weekend. People can play sports in gym, read a book or watch a TV at home, and anything else they want to do. As my case, I usually spend my time going to the beach. Many things of the beach make me to go in the weekend.

 First, people can get better relationship with family or friends. They can play a lot of games at the beach. For example, I have fun in the water by hitting water to my friends. It is very fun that I couldn't know time is going. Next, they can talk with each other about what they couldn't talk in usual. When I go to the beach, I usually sit down on the sand with my friends or family, and I spend time talking about serious theme with my family or friends. Feeling of being at the good place can make people to act like me.

 Second, people can refresh their feelings better. When I go to the beach, I can feel it's air is very fresh since there are less harmful thing near the beach. Fresh air is closely connected with people's feeling, so it can be helpful to feelings. Next, it's landscape is amazing. It's monotonous color of  sea and sand make people calm down. For example, when I go near the beach, I can just feel calm down by watching blue and beige color. Many people can have stress by having hard days in weekdays, they can just forget their stresses. 

 Finally, people can eat many foods that they couldn't eat in their daily life.  For example, when my family go to the beach, we usually eat sea shellfish, fish , and other sea animals. Food in restaraunts near the beach is fresh, so it's taste is different by eating in the daily life. Eating food is the important source of living life, so it can make people feel good.

"Many people want to spend the time with family or friends to release the stress. There are a lot of place to go picnic such as mountains, valleys, rivers, and occeans. Especially the occean is one of the most popular places in summer.  Although some people say that occean is dnagerous and there is nothing to enjoy, I believe that occean is the most proper place to spend the weekend becauseof three reasons.
     First of all, the occeans are popular in summer. As I said in the above paragraph, many people go to occean in summer. Because of temperature, we can get stress a lot in summer, and we have to release the stress by get something cold. The occean is proper place to provide cold thing such as water. In my opinion, water of occeans is usually felt cool in summer because it is too hot outside a occean. In other words, the occean is most proper place to spend the time in summer.
     In addition to temperature, people can enjoy a lot of sports in the occean. People who go to occean used to play beach volleyball. To play beach volleyball, only the ball and net are needed, and the rule is also so simple that everyone can enjoy. There are also extreme sports in the occean such as surfing. People can get the feeling that surf the wave only in the occean. Therefore, the occean is useful place to play several sports.
     The occean can provid not only entertainment but also delicious seafoods. When people all enjoy the picnic in the occean, they may feel hungry, and find to restaurants to eat delicious foods. If there are no restaurants, they should spend many time to eat the foods. However, I remember that there are generally a lot of seafood restaurants near the occens. Because the source of seafoods are occeans, the restaurants near the occean can provide fresher seafood than another places.
     In conclusion, the occean is the best place to spend time with family or friends because of temperature, sports, and foods. If you want to go picnic with your family or friends, How about the occean?"	4	4.5	3.5	12

Although there are many great choices, the best places to spend the weekend is movie theater for three reasons.

  First, movie theater is an easy place to go.  Since family or friends may be tired of their work on weekday, it is important to visit an easy place to go. In addition, visiting an easy place can make people relax and also make memories with other. On the other hand, if family or friends go to the beach or pension, they can be very tired because they have to move a long way. To sum up, visiting movie theater is the best place to spend the weekend because it is easy to go.

  Second, they can select the genre that they want to see. There are many genre such as romance, horor and fantasy. Every members or friends may like various genre, but it is easy to find the movie that everyone like. For example, if someone like romance movies and others like fantasy movies, they can find the movie that is included in romance movies and fantasy movies. After finding the movie, it is easy to see it together with big size of screen through the movie theater. Since they find the movie they commonly like, all members can enjoy watching movie and it will be a good memory for all.

  Finally, family or friends don't need to move after entering movie theater. There are places that make visitors keep moving. For example, when they visit pension, they should move to the shop and buy what they need. For some people, moving around a lot make very tired and it would be not proper place to relax. However, if they enter the movie theater, they don't need to move for almost 2 hours and all they need to do is just watching the movies they want. As a result, going to the movie theater is great way to relax.

  In conclusion, spending the weekend with family or friends in movie theater is the best choice for three reasons. Going to movie theater is easy, all members can select what they want to see and they can relax while they watch the movie. If you are able to spend the weekend with family or friends, it is great to select the movie you want and visit a movie theater."	4.5	4.5	4	13

If you don't have any plans then how about to visit the plants park?  There is a 'Hanbat plants park' nearby KAIST, so you can visit with family or friends.

There are many things to do, but all of them might be in urban site. That is why I recommand you to go camping with your people. I think going camping to mountain is a good way to spend the weekend with family or friends.
    First, you can experience new things during camping to mountain. Usually, you live in city, so you might have been mountain less than urban site. Therefore, you can get new experience while camping. Contrast to home, you should do everything to live like cooking, cleaning, and so on. During the time, you might feel excited with your active working.
Also, its for example, you can breathe with fresh air, feel fresh water flows in valley, and walk around the forest. While walking, you may see some wild animals like birds in forest, and also think about yourself.
    Secondly, there are many things to play together. I think mountains are better to play around than urban site. First, you can go hiking or tracking to mountain. You can walk oround the forest, and while walking, you might see some animals like birds. Also, there is valley to swim and play with your family and friends. At night, you can see the stars near the fire, too.

To do the things, you should commnicate and cooperate with your family and friends. During the process, you can feel getting closer to each other. Also, at night, you can talk about the things that you could not tell easily to your people before near the fire. Through sleeping with your family and friends, you can get physically closer and feel comfort with them.
    I know that going camping might be hard. However, in new convironment, you can get new feelings. If you get new feelings with your people, it must be unforgetable. I think going camping could be a nice experience with your family and friends. "	3.5	3	3	9.5

"People work hard in school or workplace, and they  lost energy and get stress on weekdays. So, people want to go outside to change their feeling and charge energy on the weekend. When they plan to go trip, they are easy to confuse with a place where they should go. Then the best place to travel is beach because of two main advantages.
 Beacause the time is limited, people should save their moving time. The beach is the fittest place with saving time. First of all, they can go beach with various way. In Korea, for example, they can use bus, train or their car because the roads are developed well. Also, the distance with beach is not that huge. Because Korea is surronded by sea, their are many beaches and easy to find local beach. It is good to go on the weeked with these reasons.
 When they go the beach, there are many entertaining. First there are many food arounf beach. Of couse, they can enjoy many kinds of seafood and the recipe is various. For example, they can eat crab, fish and shrimps, with soup, grilled, and sushi. Also, they can grilled meat on the beach. Next, their are many kinds of hobby. For example,they can drink coffee in cafe with woderful view fo beach, play beach volley ball, enjoy sunset on the sand, and just swim. People can enjoy beach with their personal foodstyle and hobby.
 In conclusion, their are many place to travel like city, moutain, etc. However, there are limit time to play and a lot of entertaining. So the beach is the best place to go."	3.5	4	2.5	10
2091	Recommend a good place to spend the weekend with family/friends. Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Recently, there are lack of good places to spend the weekend with family/freinds because of covid 19. Before the covid 19, we can use some places which people are crowded like camping sopt, swimming pool, however we can't use these places. So it is really hard to  find good places to spend time. Although many places are closed by covid 19, I really like to recommend a cafe for the place to spend time. There are three reasons why I want to recommend a cafe.
 First of all, It is very cheap to use and the time efficiency is very high. We can spend time at cafe just buying some coffee and deserts. These cost only 3000 won, and we can use that place untill the cafe close. Other places like bowling place, and escaping room cost almost 10000 or 20000 won for just 2hours. Also we try to drink coffee and eat desserts always. With coffee we can rest and talk with friends and family while we drink coffee and eat desserts. On the other hand, when we spend time at other places, we should go to cafe for just drinking coffe. So we should spend the money twice for the other places and cafe. Therefore, we should spend the weekend with family/friends at cafe at first. And it makes the time - money efficiency high.
Second, a cafe has very good mood for studying and resting. There are always a lot of  people who study and rest at cafe. In korea, cafe is place for not only just drinking coffee but also studying and resting. Furthermore, we can hear some calm musics and feel warm, so it is very suitable place for studying. With my experience, I always go a cafe to study and do some assingments with my friends. I always feel cafe is a very good places to study.
Third, there are no limit of age to use a cafe. Like PC cafe, some of may family do not want to go there. And also places like golf spot, we can't enter becuse we are too young and the cost for these places are too expensive for our age. However, there are many family and friends who are resting at cafe. So it is very comfortable to use cafe with both family and friends. For example, my family always go cafe after when we eat something at outside.  
WIth these reasons, I think cafe is the best place to spend time with family. Other people might think cafe is too simple place to spend weekend. However, in my opinion, there are no places which are more comfortable than cafe. So I strongly recommend to spend time at cafe with friends and family."	5	4	3.5	12.5

  How much time do you spend the weekends with your family? It is not easy for people in modern society to make time in weekends. So it is very important to choose the right place for healing,  and the valley is a fabulous place for weekends. A valley is a recommendable place for two reasons. 
  Family trips are different from trips with friends. We need to consider about the various ages of family members. Because of this, valleys are a good place to have a trip by the reason that it is a good place to play for everyone, regarless with the age and gender. Children can play at the river splashing around. I have a good memory myself playing with friends in the river. Some people can say that rivers in valleys can be dangerous or even deadly for children. For example, many safety television channels say that children shouldn't go to rivers. However, If adults are around to save these children, it will be safe for childrens, too. It will be nice to get safety kits with you. Also, grown-ups can play in the river, or get ready for the food in the tent. Also when the children are sleeping, adults can go to have fun with more hardcore leisure activities. It will be fun, and will be enough to throw away the stress they had. Lastly, the elders can spend healing time soaking their feet in the river and feeling the nature among them, or playing with their grandchildren. In conclusion, the valley can be a great place for a family to spend their time together, while everyone can have fun.
  Additionally, valleys are good to play all day. Almost every trip places are hard to play in the night as much as in the day time. We come back home after playing or go to a hotel to rest for the rest of the day. This could be good for resting, but I think that it will be wonderful to spend the night time in the tent, cooking hot stew, and making marshmellow shmores with the family. Spending time in the night is very important. We can talk about things that we couldn't with our family. In modern society, parents and childs are both too busy doing their work, and cannot be able too have deep talk without these opertunities. Very quiet and socialized places like the tent in the valley can make people open their heart, and make the speak the worries and thoughts in their minds. So, valleys are a valuable place which the family can spend time together in night.
  Many people still spend their weekends in coutches and watching television, rather than going out with their family. It will be good to go on a trip in weekends, and I recommend the valley. Valleys are joyable for everone regardless with age and gender, and is a place that can be spendable in night time. I hope you have a good time, and make more bond with your family in your weekend."	5	4	4	13

     What kind of place is a good place to spend the weekend with family or friends? There are several activities they can do through the weekend, such as having a talk in a cafe, hiking a mountain, go for a walk in the park, traveling unusual places, or just stay at their place and rest. What about going to a board game cafe? The topic is why going to a board game cafe is a good place to spend the weekend with family or friends. There are three reasons why I recommend board game cafe. 
     First, everyone in family or friends can participate the game. In board game cafe there are a lot of board games which suggested player count varies. For example, if there are four members in the family or friends, they can choose board games which suggested player count is four. In addition, if some members are tired and want to rest, left members can change the board game to which suggested player count matches them. Therefore, in board game cafe, all of the members of family or friends who what to play board game can participate the game. 
      Next, board game cafe provides some drinks and foods. Playing board games gives excite to players, but also requires lots of energy and make players tired and get hungry. Because of this, board game cafe provides drinks and foods and people who visit board game cafe can play board games without bothering from tired and starving. Even though the foods and drinks board game cafe provides are not as good as drinks and foods from resturants, still those are good to eat while playing board games. With the drinks and foods board game cafe provides, people can enjoy games for long time. 
      Finally, board game cafe provides private room. There are rounge where people can get board games, and private rooms for playing games. Family or friends can talk and share about some topics freely while playing board games. Though the private rooms are places side by side, the sounds get smaller outside the private room if the door is closed. In the private room, they can feel comfortable as if they are at their personal place. Therefore, board game cafe is a good place to enjoy and talk to each other due to the private room.
     To sum up, board game cafe is a good place to spend the weekend with family or friends because everyone can participate the game, drink some beverage, eat some food, and talk freely in private room. I would recommend board game cafe to you if you are finding a good place to spend the weekend with family or friends."	5	4.5	4	13.5
2094	Recommend a good place to spend the weekend with family/friends. Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"The winter is coming, it's becoming really cold outside. Although outside is really cold, there are many people to spend their time with their family or friends not in home but in outside. For these people, a department store like Shinsegae is a good place to spend their weekend. 
    The first reason I recommend a department store is that every department store is a building. Just I said before, december is start of winter. It's becoming  cold. But in case of department store, it is building. It means that the department store is inside and it is warm enough. For people who hate cold weather, warm place is a really good condition. In addition, think of a situation that you and your family or friends went outside and start to snow. That situation can be romantic, but you're going to wet because of snow. But inside a building, you don't think of that situation. It is a really good point of department store.
   Second reason is food. In case of park or other place such as amusement park, people need to find restaurant and move to there. Likewise, nowadays, many department stores have food court in basement floors. Therefore, you don't need to go far away for having lunch or dinner. People can have delicious foods just move only 2~3 floors by elevators. It can reduce people's time for moving. For example, Shinsegae department store in Daejeon, there are huge food court in basement first floor. There are many delicious foods and a aquarium. People can eat and play there. 
   The third reason is many places to enjoy. Many people say that a department store is just a place for shopping, not for playing. Although many floors in the department store is for shopping, that argument is wrong. Thesedays, many department stores are adding some facilities for playing. In Lotte department stores, there are Lotte cinemas. Also in other department stores, CGVs and Megaboxs are there. Even more, there are facilities for sports. In Shinsegae, Daejeon, there are ""Sports Monster"" where can enjoy sports. Furthermore, some academies such as coding academies are there too.
  Except for these three reasons, there are many good characteristics in a department store. People's mind is changing. A department store is not just a place for shopping, it is also a place for enjoy with your friends and family. How about visit near department store in this weekend?"	4.5	4	4	12.5

     In the sea, people can do many things like fishing and feel stable. In my case, memory of fishing with my family when I was young remains nice time. So I recommend to go to sea with family or friends on the weekend. Some people says that sea is bored but I believe that sea is good place for family and friends. I will explain why people go to sea in parts of experience, fishing and food.
     First of all, experiences are important part of spending time on the weekend. People usually can't watch sea in their daily life. People see and feel difference through going sea in other region. For example, there may be sand, stone and waves which give people relax and feel comfortable. In brief, there are new surroundings in the sea.
     In addition to experience, people can fishing in the sea. Somebody thinks that fishing is expensive and hard, but anyone can fishing through little bit of learning. When people fishing, they sit on the chair and wait. In this time, not only people can talk with family or friends, but also people can get fish so that it remains memorable moments. In short, fishing in the sea is good time.
     Lastly, people can eat seafood easily around the sea. People usually eat in the city so there is no chance to eat seafood. But there are many seafood around the sea so people can eat new kinds of food. Because food makes people happy, it is good time to eat new seafood. As a result, people can eat new seafood around the sea.
     People are in the city so they can't experience sea. There are special reasons why sea is good: new experience through view, fishing and seafood. My memory of sea remains good memory, so I strongly recommend to go sea and spend time with family and friends. Especially, fishing is nice to have good time. In conclusion, sea is good place to spend time with family and friends on the weekend."	3.5	4	3	10.5
2096	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" During college life, most students join the clubs and enjoy thier hobby. There are many kinds of clubs to achieve several goals, such as watching or playing sports games, playing instruments, and volunteering. Even though there are a lot of hobbys, I think exercising for sports game is the best hobby for college students.

 First, sports make students healthy. Since the college students are busy to study and work hard for their future, they spend most of their time sitting on the chair indoor. However, sitting on the chair for a long time harm spine health. It can cause spine disk or turtleneck syndrom. Also, vitamin D, which is crucial for human body, cannot be synthesized because they could not get enough sunlight indoor. When playing sports become their hobby, they can be away from the chair and move a lot. Streching done before and after playing sports game can stretch the muscles. Moreover, outdoor activities provide enough amount of sunlight that make synthesis of vitamin D is possible. Therefore, playing sports as a hobby can make the students healthier.

 Second, while playing sports, students' social network can be wider. Sports is one of the strongest point to connect people. For example, Korean baseball fans of each teams are strongly connected and fight with other teams' fans. Also, in 2002, all Korean go to street and cheer the 'Red Devil' up together. Besides, some sports done by team, such as basketball and soccer, team members spend a lot of time to make synergetic result. They exercise, play the game, and eat their meal during the activities all together. As the sports bind the people and sports team members spend long time together, college students can make good friends while playing sports. The social network of  college is very important because it directily affects for getting job or planning future. Playing sports makes possible to get collegues, and it is helpful for their future life.

 In conclusion, I think playing sports is a good hobby for college students. It is because playing sports is good for their health, and they can extend their social network. Although there are lots of hobbies that college students can choose, but I highly recommend them to have  more than one sports play daily. "	3.5	4	3	10.5
2097	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, lots of people enjoy there free time by watching vidoes with their phone. Eventhough lots of college students’ hobbies   are associated with their phones, I believe exercising is the best hobby for college students for the following two reasons. Sports enables students to stay healthy and helps them to study better.

 First of all, playing sports helps college students to stay healthy. Nobody would reject the idea that exercising is good for our health. Moreover, as college students spend most of their time sitting on a chair, the benefit of sports would be noticible. One of my college friend frequently plays basketball and running along the campus. Before he started to make sports as his hobby, he oftenly got sick. However, as he started to exercise, his body condition is always great, and his skin contidition became way better. The benefit of exercising is not limited to biological health. By exercising, students can handle their stress, so it also helps mental health too. As college students does not have enough time to take care of their health, playing sports is the best way to stay healthy.

 In addition, by exercising students can get better grades. Working out and getting a good grade seems to be irrevalent, but lots of researches supports the idea of getting a good grade by exercising. For example, according to a research done by KAIST, a science university at South Korea, exercising before study helps the brain. The research was done by looking at two different groups of people. The first group was just asked to memorize words. On the other hand, the second group was asked to memorize words after joging for 10 minutes. The result showed that the people of second group was able to memorize 15 percent more comparied to the first group. This result is due to brain concentration. Studing after working out some time enables the brain to get rid of other thoughts which helps people to focus more. As one of main goals of college students are getting good grade, exercising is one good way for achiving it.

 To sum up, exercising helps college students in both health and grade. Eventhough exercise has so many important benefits, students does not need to pay money for them. As lots of students have short budget, exercising is a good hobby for college students."	4	4	4	12

2099	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think  a good hobby for college students is playing League of Legends.

I have several reasons for holding my opinion.
The first reason is that League of Legends can make communication ability.
In this game, we should fight with enemy team and cooperate with four my teammates. But fighting with team members and many communication errors destroy many games. In these situations, we can learn about how to listen other peoples voice and talk about my opinion.
Finally, we can get correct answers and cooperate with teammates to win this game.

The second reason is that League of Legends can make logical thinking.
Many people think  like this.  ""I am good player but movement of our teammates so ridiculous. So i cannot win this game."" It is not logical thinking. So many people who have not played LOL think this game can't make logical thinking. But it is not true.  Players who really want to win the game and improve own ability must see many videos about game analysis or pro game. For example, if we want to be a good billiard player, we should know about lots of path and angle. So many billiard player watch video about professional plays.  It is same. Professional players' movement  is very sophisticated and logical. If they have no reasons , they don't move to get money. Because if we get plus in one side with no reasons,  we can get more minus in other side. Most of their movements  are computational.  If we watch these videos, we  can get this computational thinking. Computation about plus and minus should always occur in this game.


The third reason is that League of Legends can make friendship.
We can make friendship in this game because many students enjoy this game.  If you have lots of time,  you can play a lot. In many games, we should communicate, cooperate with friends spontaneously.  And competition can improve this relationship.  All "	3	2.5	2	7.5

Some students play computer games and other students play soccer with their friends. In addition, students whose hobby is playing musical instruments form a band and perfrom on the streets. Then, what is a good hobby for college students? I think riding a bike is a good hobby for college students. I am going to talk about three reasons why riding a bike is a good hobby.
 First, we can save the environment by riding bicycles. If we travel short distances by bicycle, we can reduce the number of times we take cars or buses. It is good for the environment because it can reduce carbon emissions. If we get used to traveling short distances by bicycle, it will be possible to travel long distances. Then we may not need a private car because we can travel in Korea only with public transportaion and bicycles. In conclusion, we can save materials for making cars and this contributes greatly to preserving the environment.
 Second, we can exercise and stay and stay healthy by riding a bike. We need to do aerobic exercise to lose and maintain weight and there are typical aerobic exercises such as walking, running, and swimming. However, walking is not efficient and running is difficult to do for a long time. And swimming is difficult to do often around. That is why I recommend riding a bicycle. When riding a bike, if you feel tired while running fast, you can press the pedal slowly. This is because even if you step on it slowly for a moment, your stamina will recover quicky. Also, you can exercise your legs at the same time because you have to give your legs a"	3	3.5	3.5	10

However, when studying, they just sit in front of desks for huge hours and even they rarely do just stretches. Beacause of these habbits, many students have problems with their health and this could be critical when they get older. But with constant exercise, you can enforce your muscles, which can prevent many health problems. Second is for their grades. There is a saying, 'healthy mind comes from healthy body'. As it says, our body's physical properties also impact our brain(thinking) which is prooved in many researches. So in long term  view, physical activities make your body and brain stronger. Also in short term view, when you feel tired from many homeworks or long study, some light physical activity can help you refresh and more easily focus on what you were doing. In conclusion, doing exercise or playing sports can lead to an inhencement in grades. Lastly, physical hobby can lead to better relationship with friends.

I usually play footsal or soccer in my rest time. Playing these sports need a lot of concetration to play well. When I was thinking about stress while playing soccer, I can't play soccer well. In contrast, when I concentrate on soccer, I can't think about my stress. Therefore, during playing soccer, we can lose our stress or other negative thinking. Next, almost of college students want to make friends. Sports can be a best media of making friends. As a feature of sports, it needs a lot of communication to make a good play as a team. Making communication is a good way to be a friend, so playing sports make people closer to each other. Furthermore, there are many people in a game, so we can be frienly with a lot of people. Finally, everybody know this fact, playing sports are good for health. Students are spending a lot of time for sitting on chair. This situation is not good for health. We need to move and do activative thing. Sports is a best thing to move. Good helath by sports can make a good concentration to study.

However, the group members are simillar with each other, we can get the advantages when they get the hobby. I think the reading books is a good hobby for college students. I will talk about why I think the reading books is good for college students.
First, we can get more information. the main purpose of entering college is learning. the students get lesson of professor to get new information. In this situation, we can read  books to get more information because the books are written by so many people and they have a lot of information. we can also find the information that we need because the books are generally have a topic. So, reading books is a effective way to get new information.
     Second, we can experience the world early. Almost students have been protected by their parents, and they don't know about the world well. However, we can get some advice by reading books. almost writer are older than us, and they have experienced the world more than us. We can get information of society by reading what they experience. we also get information about jobs and it can help us decide our job. So, reading books can help us to get the direction of our life
     Third, we can solve stress by reading books. there are also some books for entertainment such as comic books or novel. If we need some rest, we can spend our free time by reading these books. In the case of novels, we can improve our mind because they contain the writer's mind. "	3	3	3	9

For example, they can play sports such as soccer and basketball or they can watch video clips or movies. In my opinion, the best hobby for college students is playing sports. I have several reasons for this.
Firstable, playing sports is very helpful for our health. Since they are college students, they should study very hard and it costs a lot of energy. If they only study, they can be very tired and lazy after studying with means there health will be worse. The great solution for this problem is to play sports regularly. It will make you more healthier and as a result they can study more times.
Next, playing sports is a hobby that college students can do together. There are more ways to make their health better such as getting PT. But, playing sports has a great advantage that they can do it together. If sometimes they are very lazy and tired, they don't want to do some work to make their health better, but if their are someone to do it together, they can get some energy even though they are very tired. This is why can do it together is a great advantage.
Finally, they can get many acheivements alone or with their friends while playing sports. Most of college students would not be good at playing sports when they start it for the first time. But, when they do it regularly with none absence, they can finally be good at playing sports. During that period, they can feel lot of acheivements like winning at some events. And this acheivements will be a good reasons for them to continue playing sports.
These are the reasons why I think that playing sports is a good hobby for college students."	3	2	3	8
2106	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Playing instruments, the Best Hobby for College Students

     Do you have hobbies? Hobby is very important to people to get out their stress. But if I ask about hobbies to college students, some people said that they don't have hobbies. So for that students, I want to introduce the hobby which is good for college students. That is playing instruments. Let me introduce some advantages of playing instruments.
     First of all, playing instruments is very useful hobby. Some hobbies like playing game are not that much helpful to collge students. But, if you learn instruments, you can use  it forever. For example, you can perform it in party or you can participate in orchestra, too.
    Second, playing instruments doesn't take that much time. College students might be busy because of the class or study. However, learning instruments doesn't take that much time. In my case, I go to lesson once a week for one hour. And I have practice time once a week for one hour. It just take two hours a week. If you have a lot of time, then you can have a lot of practice time. But even you have a little time, you can try it, too. 
     Someone might say that learning instruments take too much money. I agree with this opinion because most of instruments like violin are expensive. But you can borrow the instruments or buy  instruments for beginners that is cheap. Or for those people who hesitate to learn instruments because they are expensive, I recommend the Calimba. You can buy Calimba with 20 dollars, and there are a lot of videos talking about how to play it in Youtube. And also, because it has small sound, you don't have to worry about the fight with neighborhood.
     To sum up, because playing instruments is useful and doesn't take that much time, I recommend it for college students for hobby. If you think that your life is too boring, how about to learn a instrument? It will give you small but definite happiness for you. Think about the instruments that you want to learn. I hope my article is helpful to you."	3	3	3.5	9.5
2107	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"What is your hobby? Thesedays, because of Covid-19, it is hard to do some hobbies such as exercise. So do I. I am freshman of the college, but I can't do my hobbies that much. So, I usually walk around while listening to music. I think walking is a very good hobby for college students, and these are my reasons.
First of all, it is an activity that I do alone. It sounds like a badside of it, but in Corona pandemic, it could be an advantage. Nowadays, it is hard to meet friends and play each other. However, when we walk, we do not have to worry about it. Also, while walking, you can think about yourself. I usually walk and think about today. Sometimes I feel good, and sometimes I regret with my mistake. I think It could be a new experience for you.
Also, walking can make us healthy. Walking is very easy activity and we do this all day, but did you know walking is very efficient exercise? When we walk, we can get lid of bad things in our body by sweating. And we lose fat in our body, too. Also, we can get fresher air than inside of your room. For more, we can feel fresh after walking. 
Finally, by walking, we can go and see new side of our college. Usually, we use car to go some where. It is very fast, but because of that point we can not see the things of our town and college. While walking around the college, we can see trees, flowers, sky. Sometimes we could go to landmark near the college. Maybe, it will be your best place ever you been. Who knows?
Because of Covid-19, I know all of us feel low and exhausted. From today, how about walking around of your college? It will be fun than you are thinking!"	3	2.5	2.5	8

2109	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" I was very confused when I become a college students and come college. Because in the high school, I was so busy that I always have something to do, but after i become a college student I have so much time to spend and I can't spend the time more efficiently. So I always think what should I do for the resting time and for the hobby. After the long thinking, I finally got one answers.
 I think going trip with people who I really like and who are very important to me. There are three reasons why I think this is the best hobby for college students. 
 First reason is that in the high school,  especially we didn't spend our time for our family. When I was 17years old by Korean age, my grandfather became 80 years old. In Korea 80years old is very important. So our family and cousins are prepared for the trip with my grandfater and mother, however I was trying my best to get better score. So I can't go there. Now, I am very regretful about that trip. I always think I had to go there for our family and my grandfather to make some memory about us. And also my family always said that if I was there , it could be better trip for everyone. So I think the college students who have much time should go trip with their family to make some memory before they regret about this.
Second reason is we are fully grown. When we were young, it was hard to walk longer, and if the weather is too hot or the weather is too cold, then we become angry and didn't follow our parents order. So it was very hard trip for our parents. But now, we are fully grown and we can help our parents and if we go for trip, It must be the better trip. In my case, my father always said that his wish is 'if you become abult, let's go trip and drink some beers with me.'. So what I want to say is now it is time to help our parents and just stay beside them and drink some beers! All of your parents must want to take trip with you.
Third reason is when we go for trip, we can earn some expensive experience that we can't get. If we always in the college and sit front of desktop, the amount of  informations and experiences that I can earn is very little and limited. However with trip for some new place and some place that I want to go and some place for earn information,  we can get better experiences and informations and also the amount is almost unlimited. In my experiece, I had been museum with my friends. While I was going, it was hard and I couldn't understand why my friends wanted to go there. However after the museum tour, my new information about pictures and drawings become much larger than before and I can earn the experiences that I couldn't get if I was in the room all day.
With these reasons, I think going for trip is the best hobby for college students and I recommend to you if you have time to go trip."	4	3	3	10
2110	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Reading Books
     Including my case, many college students feel dificult finding their hobies. They spend their time playing games, watching cellphones or doing nothing. So they want to find out their hobbies. I think the most useful hobby is reading books. 
     First, it helps their study. College students are also studying their major by using specific meterials. The Knowledges from books are different with other meterials. Also, using specific maetrials make students bored. Students can find their interests for their major by reading books. 
     Second, college students' language skills could grow up. Students' language skills are weak although they study when they were young. Also, high school's language education is only for their tests. Useful language skills would grow up by practicing speaking, listening and reading. Nowdays, students have less opportunities to read. So their reading skills cannot grow up. Then, they will get a lot of difficult in societies. 
    Third, books can help them to find another hobbies. There are lots of information in books. While reading books, they can know about a lot, and they can find their another interests. So it will help to find another hobbies.
    In conclusion, reading books can help study, make language skills grow up and help to fing another hobbies. I think many students have to try to read books. "	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
2111	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Playing instruments for a hobby
  What would be a good hobby for college students? There are chances to encounter lots of hobbies in college, because we are more free and there are more clubs than in highschool. Sports like swimming, basketball, soccer could be healthy and playing instruments can be joyfull. But from all of these various hobbies, I think that playing instruments is the best hobby for college students, especially in KAIST.
  The first reason I thought that playing instruments is a good hobby is because we have less time to practice instruments in highschool or when we are younger. Being a highschool student in korea is very hard. Students are always thinking about the big test 'sooneung' in 3rd grade winter, so they have no time to enjoy hobbies. Actually, when I asked my 3rd grade highschool friends about how they get rid of stress, most of them answer 'sports'. By using their bodies, they can have a better mind and body, so most of them do sports at highschool, not playing instruments. Because students have less opertunities to play instruments while living as a student in Korea, I think many people can enjoy it in college instead.
  The second reason is that there are many people in college. If your major is not related to music, it is hard to meet friends who have the same interest in you. Especially people who play the same instrument as you are hard to find. But in college, we can make clubs so that we can spend time with the people who are intersted in the same instrument, and share lots of informations about it. College is a place where various people meet, so it will be helpfull to all of the club members. Even if you don't know anything about the instrument, people who are good at playing can help you out with learning. So it will be good to join or make instrument clubs in college, to learn instruments for a hobby.
  Lastly, you can make people happy with your instrument. People become happy when they hear good songs, and if you play a song with a pure heart with lots of emotions, the listener will be so happy. Also, you will also become happy because of the fact that you could help somebody with a song that you practiced. I think those experiences don't come that often, and by practicing and sharing a song by your instrument, you can make these experiences yourself. So, I hope that you can spread hope with what you love(your hobby), and a good way to do that is playing instruments for a hobby."	4.5	4	4	12.5
2112	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Most of college students’ life is much more free than high school students because high school education is a lot fixed, compared to college and they are busy preparing for the college exam. This means that the college students can use their own time by themselves when high school students have limitation because of lack of time. In my case, I had so much things to do in high school and got busy, which made me forgot what I usually did for my hobby. My biggest goal was going to university which I wanted to go, and to reach this goal, I could even stop my hobby for a while and concentrate on preparing for my goal. I archived my goal, but when I graduated high school and became a college student, suddenly I felt lost. I decreased my time for hobby to accomplish my goal, and after I got the goal, I felt like being lost in forest and don’t know where to go. I spent my time uselessly for a while, but I made a promise to myself. I'll get my hobby back. My hobby was solving hard coding problems and playing board games. I started my usual hobby again suddenly, and it felt arkward at first, but I get used to it soon. I’m satisfied to my hobby now, and I will continue having my time for hobby. Of course having some hobby related to their future job can be useful. But I think having hobby which they paused while passing through busy schedule in high school is better for college students."	1	1.5	1.5	4
2113	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, because of COVID 19, student's cannot go out with more than 4 friends. Then, what activities can students play? I think the basketball is the best activities to play. Many people might think basketball needs 10 players because basketball is 5 vs 5 sport, but that's wrong. We can play basketball with only 2 people. We can play 1 vs 1 on half court. Also, 2 vs 2 is available too. This is the first reason why I recommend basketball as a great hobby for students. In Daejeon, Seoul and the other capital areas, the social distance level is high. Under this condition, basketball is safe to play! Second reason, basketball is easy to learn and play. The dribble and shoot is the only skills that students  need to learn to play basketball. It doesn't take too much time to learn it. If they are being well at that skills? They become ready to play basketball. Final reason is in case of  2 vs 2, student's can improve their cooperative and friendship. They can talk about how to move through the defenders, who will shoot the ball and how to decieve the defenders. Through this communicate, their friendship will grow up. These three things are the reasons why I think the basketball is the best hobby for college students."	2	2	1.5	5.5
2114	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Good Hobby for College Students

          There are many hobby for people. In case of college students, they should take courses, live in dormitory, do homework, etc. They get stress because of work. But, it is true that college students have much time than normal people. So it is good for they to have good hobby which can reduce stress and do with other students. There are many sports like basket ball, soccer, tennis and so on. There are three reasons why sports are good hobby for college students.

          First of all, all people can enjoy sports. We can see that many kind of people are participated in official sports events. Gender, tall, racious are not relative to play sports. This means that we can enjoy people with any students in college. If you want to play sports, you just join club or call friend.

          Second, we can play sports in near court. There are many courts in college for sports. Near gym or school, probably they have courts. So if you have people to play with, you can enjoy sports in near place. You don't worry weather. There are many inner sports place. You can enjoy on cold, rainy or snow day.

          Third, sports are funny. If you and your friends have nice sportsmanship and manner, sports game will be clear and activative. You know, sports reduce stress. For college students who get many stress through homework and research, sports are good solution."	2	2	2	6
2115	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Recently, Longer Covid-19 era is, many students want more face-face class. But, the other students want due to convien
  First of all, we can improve digital literacy. This means that not only we can get fixed knowledges from professor, but also we get combined and new knowledges while watching online video lectures. Traditionary, we just listened lecture like news in TV. So, we just understand the knowledge which professor always say correctly. However, in the case of online video lecture, we can use personal laptop and search related news,  journals and the dictionary freely whenever we want during class time. This can make us to listen from various point of view, not fixed.
   On the top of that, the second advantage is saving time. Traditionally, we have to go to the classroom to view live lecture. This moving time is waste of time in our life. For example, when I was in KAIST two years ago, I spent the time for preparing my appearance and moving to the N24 building about total above 30minutes. But, now, we can enter to the online classroom such as zoom and google meet in 5minutes, even in anywhere. In other words, we can earn the valued time about 20minutes. 
 Lastly, the third advantage is existing convenience tools for understanding lecture. We can use various tools for understanding lectures well. Before the COVID-19 era, in English class, if we didn't know something, we have to question professor directly surrounding many people or have to search dictionary after class. But, at this time, we can understand easily what the professor and students say in lectures using caption function, enhanced translator and grammar tool named grammarly. For example, there are real-time cc in chrome and samsung galaxy One UI. Even, chrome provide translated caption to Korean from English. This is the best tool for listening and understanding whole lectures.
   To sum up, when we watch online video lectures, we can improve digital literacy, save waste of time in life and use various tools for understanding in real-time."	5	4.5	4	13.5

            Many people says "" Please stop covid-19.” . We can’t meet friend easily, we can’t eat at restaurant easily. There are many limits due to covid-19. Also, we got many changes in education part. We use online videos for lecutre instead of live lectures in a traditional classroom. There are many contraversal arguments on it. Some people wnats traditional live lecture, and some people wants online video lecture. However, although online lecture was become due to bad covid-19, it is great change for students as following reasons. 
            First, we can save time. When we have all live lecture, we should change the classroom for every classes. Generally, there are 3-5 classes a day. So we are spend at least 1 hour walking  to classroom. It is very hard work. Especially, when summer, it is terrible because it is too hot so we become wet before the lecture. It makes us that we can’t concentrate on the lecture. We should cool our body at least 5 minutes. Winter is also same. Cold weather makes us we can’t focus on the lecture at first due to cold weather. However, when we use online video for lecture, we don’t need to spend time walking to classrooms. It saves more than 1 hour and our power. It makes us we can focus on lecture easily.
            Second, we can watch again when we have best condition. Most of 1st grade sutdents drink at night. Since they are too young to control the amount of drinks, they have bad condition at morning. Other grade students also have drink appointment or assignment. They are sometimes busy at  night. So it is impossible to concentrate the lecture always. If we use online video lecture, we can record them and watch it again when we have best condition. It help us understand the lecture well. Also, we can stop the watch and replay it again when professor’s speaking speed is too fast to understand or we can’t understand well. It must help understanding the lecture. 
            Thrid, it is more easy to focus on the lecture. For live lectures in traditional classroom, there are various things that interrupt my concentration. For example, screen has light-reflection makes us can’t see some part of screen, the classroom which is too large makes us can't see the professor’s face, friend who talk to me makes us loose some part of lecture. However, in online lecture, there are gone. We can see the lecture content in my monitor which do not have light-reflection and have proper size to see it. Also, we have private place to focus on the lecture.
            In conclusion, Online video lecutes has huge benefits. We can save time that was spent walking to other classroom and we can watch the lecture again when we are ready to focus on the lecture. Also online video is better than traditional classroom. For these reasons, online video lecture is better than live lecture."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
2117	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Traditionally, lectures of colleges was being in a classroom. Professors, students have to go to the classroom where lectures start. However, because of COVID-19, many colleges started to do online lectures. This phenomenon made different culture of lecture. Many students are satisfied with new lecture style. Although there are some problems with online lectures, such as students less focus on lecture, advantages of watching video is quite powerful. In this article, we are going to write 3 advantages of online video lectures.
     First, professors and students don't need to go to classroom. In traditional class, students have to go classroom at right time to check their attendances. And distance between where students live and where classroom is located was not short. Some students felt lack of time to go to classroom when another lecture classroom is located on other building. Online lectures solve this problem because they don't have to go classroom. Students can join the lectures if they have electronical devices such as mobile phone, lab top, and tablet PC. By online lectures, physical limitation of traditional class was solved. 
     Second, students can understand more about what they learn because of recorded video lectures. There was no chance to listen or watch previous lectures in traditional classes, because classes didn't be recorded. So, if students didn't understand lectures well, they had to study or search individually. This could make students to understand what they learn less. However, during the online lectures, many professors give students recorded lectures. When they upload recorded lectures, students can rewatch the lectures that they miss some parts, and they can understand more.
     Finally, online lecture can give students more time. In colleges, some lectures are real time lectures, and other lectures are not. If students take the subject that lectures are non-real time, they can use their time more flexible. They can control their schedules between individual task and watching the lectures.
     For these reasons, students can use their time more and understand the lectures more. Although traditional lectures also have some advantages, online lectures are still have more advantages for students."	4.5	4	3	11.5
2118	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of COVID-19, almost every schools in globe start online lectures. Because of that situation, I experienced about 2 years for online lecture in recent years, and I also experienced offline lecture from 2018 to 2019. Some students around me argue offline lecture is better than online lecture, but for me, online lecture is better than offline lecture. I'll give 3 specific reasons why online lecture is much better than offline lecture.  
First, students can give questions to professor easily. Questions are very important to understand the lecture. For almost every lecture, students can't understand everything at once. Questions gives help to correct misunderstandings in our head and give new imformations what they didn't understnad in an initial lecture. For offline lecture, students hard to give questions to professor because of shyness and lack of time. Many students feels that lots of students already know what I don't know, so they feel shyness about questioning in front of professor and other students. Also, there are 1 professor and lots of students in class, there is limit to solving questions for professor. But, for online lecture, student have less shyness because they don't see each other's face directly. They are just looking a monitor instead during the lecture. And, by using chat function in zoom, professor can get several questions at once. Even though professor can't answer the quesiton at that moment, students can get answer after the class by e-mail because professor already know about their questions.
Second, students can listen more lectures than offline. Because students are also human-being, they have limit on physical thing. For offline lecture, they have to move classroom after the class. It is sometimes hard because a campus is very large. Other problem for this is it takes time. It means that students have to consider moving classroom time when offline lecture.  On the other hand, for online class, students don't have to move. By just switching zoom rooms, they can move classroom very fast. 
Finally, students can review lecture materials much easier. As many people know, pre-studying and reviewing are principles of understanding the lecture. When students take a lecture in offline, they have to write down everything what professor writing on slide. This method is easy to miss some important things and take time for just writing. It means that students have no time for understanding in class. On the contrary, students can get lecture materials in pdf or ppt files from professors or TAs easily in online lecture. Also, they can record real-time lectures by computer recording program, so they don't have to get stressed by just writing everything which is already in the lecture material.
In conclusion, online lecture has several advantages against offline lecture. Students can give questions to professor easily because of less shyness and zoom chat function. Also students can listen more lectures because they don't have limit for moving class time and physical things. Additionally, students can review lecture materials much easier by ppt, pdf files or recording file from computers. Because of making vaccines and cures for COVID-19, lots of schools are going back to traditional lecture method. But, online class not only has advantages for social distancing. We should consider the advantages of online lecture carefully, and manage these advantages after COVID-19 era.  "	4.5	4.5	4	13

Actually there are a lot of advantages of watching online video lectures, and I will notice you from now on.
  Online lectures aren't more time consuming than live lectures. To viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom, you must have to go a classroom before the lecture starts. And the classroom is not a your room, so you have to prepare the things for lectures like major books, an ipad, a notebook and so on. However, in online system, you are in your room. It means that you don't need time for preparing the lecture, and you don't need to go the classroom. In addition, lecture time can be increased because there is no classroom change time. It can improve your study quaility.
  Online lectures are beneficial not only in time, but also in study efficiency. If you watch live lectures, you have only one chance to listen. And there are some difficulty if professors' pronounce or speed isn't fit your listening ability. However, as you all know, you can deal the online lectures yourself. You can watch the online videos several times or adjust the speed and sound. By doing so, your lecture understanding levels are improved, and it makes your knowledge more sophisticated.
  Your lecture participation levels also can be improved by wathcing online lectures. In a traditional classroom, you must ask questions by your voice. However, in online lectures, there is chatting window. So you can just chat some questions that you have in the lecture, and you can make the question that only the professor can see.

At frist, there were many concern about online lectures because there was expectation that the quallity of lecture would be downgraded. But for now number of students prefer online lectures because of its advantages. The most common online lecture type is online video lectures. There are many advantages for online video lectures compare to the live lecture in classroom and it'll be explained in following paragraphs.
First of all, we don't need to move from classroom to classroom. When we do lectures in classroom, students have to move from classroom to classroom. It was really exhausting when the location of classrooms are far and if we have many lectures in one day we should spend pretty much time in moving. Addtionally, we have to carry all of the lecture materials such as book or lecture note which are really heavy. However, with the online video lecture, we don't need to do all of this hard things. 
Furthermore, we don't need to be at the campus and allow us various environments. To take online lecture, you only need to prepare proper equipment. So online video lecture allowed us large range of choices in studying area. We can pick our favorite place to take lecture like home, cafe, studyroom or wherever you want. Ofcourse you can change your place everyday. For live lecture in traditional classroom, many people should gather in small room and be quiet during the whole lecture time but with online lecture you can adjust you studying place to maintain your concentration highly.
Most of all, we can pause the lecture when we can' understand. The lecture contents are usually not easy so we can't understand at once. But it was not easy to request professor to stop the lecture because you don't understand it in live lecture. However, in the online video lecture, you don't need to care about others and feel free to pause untill you understand and repeat the same part as much as you want. By this, the rate of understanding about the lecture can be improved a lot.
To sum up, online lecture reduce effort and energy to move from classroom to classroom, allow us many studying place, and can be paused or repeated as much as you understand it. Many students hope 2022 spring semester also become online lecture agian because the quality of lecture was not that much downgraded and online video lectures have many advantages. The advantages of video lecture seems so strong because there are some students wants video lecture uploaded even if we do face-to-face lecture."	4	4	4	12
2121	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"As you know, all lectures are online videos in Intermediate English Reading & Writing class. most are live lectures but some are uploaded videos. I really love this class. It really helpful for me to writing English. Also It takes few time. This semester is my first online semesyer because I was went military but I fell in love to online class.
First, watching online video lectures save times. When I was freshman of KAIST, I had English Speaking class by Horgan professor(spelling confused..) at 9 am. Ariving at right time to N9 is so hard to me. I had to wake up until 8:30 am but when I drunk alcohol I waked up 9:00 or sometimes sleep to 12 am. To take live lectures, student have to use times. However, online class is more efficient. To open and prepare the live lecture, Just turn on the notebook and the zoom. More surprisingly, if course is not a live lecture, student only watch the uploaded videos until remained times. It make the student study on their best time.
Second, online class give high quaility lectures rather than offline class. online class has no limit to time, classroom and so far.  Traditional classroom has limited seat and desk so some people can’t take the class. Also, all students looks same lecture, same presentation on online class. Quention and Answering are more easier by text and voice chating. Obviously, the professor could check the student reactions for his lecture. 
Lastly, student review the class by uploaded video lectures and ppt. It is really helpful because student can watching the video over and over to understanding the subject. When I was talk with my friends, they said they studied online class more than offline class. Reason is they have more times and had videos to study beacause most class take online video lecture.

Nowadays, we had no other choice to take class. we had to take online video lectures to avoid covid - 19 spreading. Online class is friendly to student. It has great advantages to student. I hope next semester is a online course. "	5	4.5	4.5	14

"Many people use online lecture after the corona 19(virus). Because face to face is too danger. First of all, most of people don't like the online video lecture cause of  inconvineint and unaccustomed. Also, they delay the lecture and often miss it. But now they accept it and more prefer than live lectures in a traditional classroom. So let's talk about the reasons of their variation.

As well as, You can record or download it than you can review more easier and clear without any of missing.  Also if your national language is not English, you can see the substract to understand more quickly. When I enter this university, KAIST, I tired to allow the lectures cause of English. I couldn't understand the professor's talks and writing on the board. But, after the lecture changes to online video, I learn more easily about the content.
 Second, watching online video lecture help people, who want to study more, to learn details. After the corona 19, many university make site to upload thier recorded lecture.  So, In many video site such as Youtube, there are many various lectures  opened by famous university like Standford,  and UC burkely.

 From these reasons, many people fall in love to online video lecture. As I mentioned, it makes people to spend thier life more easily. They can learn easily and  make individual time and understand lectures. So, we don't need to change this variation after the corona 19 finishes completely. Instead we can improve it by developing the video's functions."	4.5	4	4	12.5
2123	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Due to Covid-19, the world have been stopping everything. So, every university have turn to online education. I arrived at here in 2021, and spend two semesters in my tiny dormitory room. At first, I was upset. Because, for last 12 years, I have dreamed the life in college. Meet a girlfriend, make friends, and talk a lot was my holygrail. Heavy depressions knocked to my mind. But, after one year, I noticed that untact education has a lot of benefits. Here, I argue that advantages of online video lectures.

    First, it is time-space independent. Usually, the online videos have a time frame, and it is allowed to watch the videos in time. However, in a traditional classroom, I have to go to a lectrue room, and take a class. In my case, in the last semester, I had to get a vaccine. At that moment, My day time schedule was fully filled, and my weekend schedule also was chalkfull. But, thanks to online video lectures, I could adjust my schedule and get a vaccine. We are not God, Therefore, we cannot notice what will be happend. This flawness makes tantative schedules which is a reasons why we need online video lectures.

    Last, It is repeatable. I have been living in Korea for 20 years. I can proudly say that the time I using Korean is much greater than that of using English. I am not good at listening and understanding. For me, online video lectures are the hands of an angel. Not like real time lectures, videos are repeatable. If I miss a word during watching a video, I can check it by adjusting the time bar. Repeatable online lecture would be helpful to students.

    Of course, online video lectures have lots of drawbacks. It cannot teach relationship in society to students. But it cannot be enough excueses to just arguing online lectures are bad. In a nutshell, time-space independence and repeatable videos are strong advantages of online lectures. I was learned a lot which is I could not understand if whole lectures are held by real time. I want people to consider online education positively. Thank you."	5	4	3	12
2124	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"After COVID-19, most of lectures have changed to onlline class. Professors and students had difficulty at first, but several advantages of online classes have shown. In this paper, I explain the several advantages of watching online video lectures.
     First, students and professors can reduce their time. For live lectures in a traditional classroom, students have to wake up earlier and prepare for the classes for the day. Moreover, they have to walk or ride bikes to move to next classrooms. On the other hand, they can save the time and prepare for the next class or take a rest if they watch online video lectures. It's also good for professors because they can also save time and prepare for better lectures.
     Next, professors can make effective lectures with helpful online functions more. In a traditional classroom, there were almost only professor's explaining. However, in online video lectures, professors can use various helpful functio online like youtube link. By these, professors can convey the message more easily and efficiently, and students can also understand it more easily.
     Finally, students can study again with the saved online lecture. After the class or before the exam, students have to study the lecture again. If they took live classes in traditional classroom, they have to study with their summarized notes. However, focusing on the whole lecture and writing the summary is not a easy work, so the students can miss something. In the case of online video lectures, they can save the whole lecture in their laptop, so they can review what they missed in the class when they study alone.
     In conclusion, there are several advantages of watching online video lectures. It can reduce time for students and professors including preparing classes and moving to the classes. Furthermore, professors can make effective lectures with helpful online fuctions. And, students can use the saved online lectures when they study again."	4	3	3.5	10.5
2125	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, more and more schools or university start the online class because of COVID-19. As they do, most classes use online video lectures instead of live liectures in a traditional classroom. Some people think that it's not appropriate for students to study, so they say that original educational way should come back. However, online video lectures have more advantages than they think. I will introduce representative 3 advantages of online video lecture.
    First, video lecture can be used everywhen. As online video lecture is used, Both professors and students can get benefits. Professors don't have to go to classroom in time. They can upload video lectures or lecture note before class, and they can do other things like research in that time. Also, students can study anywhen. They watch the video lectures again and again and study with lecture notes professors uploaded when they want to. Then, they can do other things like part-time jobs. In shorts, professors and students can make their schedules more flexibly.
     Next, video lecture can be used everywhere. Originally, students have to a lot of books and things to write with, and they run from classrooms to other classrooms. However, online video lecture doesn't require them. They just keep their books in their room, and they open the books in the room when class starts. Also, they don't have to make schedule regard of paths because they are always in their room. In addition professors don't have to go to their classroom, but they can teach in their home with their kids.
     Finally, video lecture makes people close. Students who live in where is far from university can take class, and professors who live in other countries can make classes in their countries. Moreover, students can take classes of famous professors without going their classroom if they teaches in online video lectures. Consequently, students can get a better quality of education than before. Like these, through onlie video lectures, all students and professors can get closer and it leads to reduces gap between various universitis.
     To sum up, many university do online class, but some people have disagreement of it. However, video lectures have various advantages. Students and professors don't have the limits of time and place. Moreoever, it makes people closer, so reduces gaps betwenn them. In these reasons, online video lecture is good way to education, and we have to develop it more."	4.5	4.5	4	13
2126	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" These days, many students in the COVID-19 era are studying at home without going to school. They are learning what they need to learn at school by replacing it with videos. There are disadvantages of learning from online video lectures without learning directly at school, but there are also have clearly advantages. From these good effects, that could enhance the student's learning effect.
 First good thing is that student can watch it again. In many face-to-face classes, it's hard to get to know all class contents at once. Each student has a different understanding, so teacher can't stop the class and explain again for one or two people. However, if student watch the online class, they can watch the lecture again and study according to their understanding speed.
 Second good effect is that students can control the video speed. The reason why this is good is that they can study according to each necessary time. Especially during the test period, students can see a lot of information in a small amount of time if they watch online videos some times quickly. Also, when they study, it is able to quickly skip and earn time to study other part more.
 Finally, students can watch videos whenever they want. The school has a fixed class time from morning to afternoon. However, if students watch a video at home, they can watch it at any time they want. Depending on the person, there are people who can concentrate well in the morning and people who can concentrate well in the afternoon and evening. If they watch a video while they can concentrate wel on each one, they can also get learning efficiency.
 For following these three reasons, learning with online video classes have the advantages."	5	4.5	4	13.5
2127	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Becuase of the Covid-19, most university in Korea are using  online platforms for classes. Some students say that this is not good for understanding and it is boaring. Also, it seems that everyday- online classes  make people depressed. However,  there are not only disadvantages. Watching online video lectures is better than attend to real classroom in several points.

             First, online classes help students' good comprehension on the lectures. Students can watch videos many time if they couldn't understand the lectures well. In traditional classroom, there is only one chance to Note-take and listen to professor. However, on online lectures, students can get lots of chance to repeat videos until they understand clearly. 

             Second, watching online lecture is very  efficient. Students don't have to go to school  for their classes. They can watch the video anywhere. So they can save time and money. They can study more instead of spending time on bus, subways and roads.

             Finally, students can be more free on their living with online classes. Most online video lecture allow students to watch videos when each of them wants. So students can plan their life patterns in various ways. For example, they don't need to wake up early in the morning to attend to classes which start on 9 am. Even if they wake up on 1 pm, their is no problem. However, this advantage can be a disadvantage for someone. But this is very beneficial for busy students.

            In conclusion, watching online video instead of viewing live lecture has some advantages. Watching videos help student understand their lectures well. Also, it is efficient and give students more freedom on their life styles. But every student have difficult preference on online or offline classes because offline classes also have several advantages. So the best way for everyone is using both online lecture and traditional system, properly."	4	3.5	4	11.5

        Since the first semester of 2020, people started online lectures because of the global infectious disease COVID-19.  Therefore, students watched lecture videos instead of going live lectures. People say online lecutres have some disadvantages for studying. Of course, it is true, but many students said there are more advantages than disadvantges when we watch online video lectures. There are two big advantages of watching online video lectures vesus viewing live lectures in a traditional class room.
        First, student can watch the lecture anywhere and anytime they want. When students go to the classroom and view live lectures in there, they feel its boring and tired. If the lecture is scheduled in 9 am, then student should wake up before 8 am to prepare. On the other hand, students don’t have to wake up early and go to the classroom in online lectures. They can watch the lecture in dormitorty, home, or anywhere they want. Also if the lecture is recorded video and given to students, then they can watch the same lecture at 9 pm, not 9 am. It means that students can watch the lecture when they want. It is a very big advantage.
        Second, students can watch the lecture again. When students go to the classroom and view live lectures, they cannot watch it again. Therefore, if you don’t pay attention for a moment, you can’t hear what professor said again. On the other hand, since the many online lecture are given as a video, students can watch it again. If they missed something in lecture. It is very big advantage because if we can watch it again and find some missing things, it helps students to study hard and helps not to miss the assignments.
        To sum up, Online video lectures have two big advantages versus viewing live lecture in classroom. Since, the lectures are given as the video and students don’t have to go to the classroom, they can watch the lectures anywhere and anytime they want. Also, because lectures are given as video, students can watch the lecture again. It helps students to find some missing things and study hard. As this essay shows, watching online video lectures have many advantages versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom. "	4	4	3.5	11.5
2129	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"By COVID 19, recently many school and academy use online video lectures instead of live lectures. At first, many students and teachers said about hard of using vieo lectures. But now, many students and teachers think online video lectures have adavtages that live lectures don't have. So, today, I'll talk about what are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom.
 First, video lecture can adjust like video. we can make it faster or slower so that hear more clearly and we can pause the video too. Making the video faster is basic skills of Korea SAT (a.k.a. Su-neung) Students. They use lots of internet lectures and they have to study it more faster. So, many student use x1.5 or x2.0 faster for internet lectures. Also, many internet lecture company provide faster options for their video programs (ex. EBSi, megastudy, Daesung). We can pause it and thinking more or taking note more. For traditional live lectures, it have limited time, so students don't have enough time to solve the example problems of the lectures. However, in the video lectures, many teachers said ""Pause the video and solve it."".  Solving example problem is very important experience for studying and video lectures can make much more experience.
 Second, we can watch the lectures when you wnat. For my real experience, I have to go hospital for my ear ache. If it was traditional live lectures in a classroom,  I can't study the lecture that time. But it was online video lecture, and teacher said me ""It is OK. You can watch the video after went from hospital."".  This is very big different with traditional lecture. Also, for my high school, many student have to go outside for science fair or camp. Many student in school sleep or doze by their hard study at night. So they didn't taking note. With repalying feature of the video lectures, we can easily solve this problem. Also, student can study the lectueres when the time that they can concentrate study. 
 Finally, teacher can use PC features more easily.  After COVID, many school provide tablets for teacher for video lectures. Many teacher can make higher quality video with this tablets. PC video editing was good for lecture quality too. Also, with recording, teacher just record one video for all classroom. For traditional classroom, teachers have to go each classroom and have to same lectures. But, with video lecture, teacher just make one video and it will make quality more higher. Teacher just have to concentrate more for one video then several same live lectures.
 In conclusion, online video lectures have advatages like video adjusting. watching video when you want and  teacher can use PC features more easily versus live lectures in a traditional classroom. By this advantages of online video, this industry will be grow after the COVID too. Many students said they can study more with the video lectures. After COVID, we can combine traditional lectures and online lecture for more higher quality of study experience. It will be very exciting features for next students."	4	4.5	3.5	12
2130	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"    Because of the Corona virus, many people are unable to meet each other. So, many schools turned their class into  non-face-to-face classes. At first, people might think that  online classes would not be operated very well. But, many people are saying that this online lecture might be better that you think . It means that online classes has various advantages, and here they are.
    First, there is no space and time restrictions. In other word, we can watch the class anywhere anytime if you have a electronic device. This would be a good news for the people who takes long time to go to the school and take the class. Also, if you have to do important job at class time, you can just watch the lecture later. So, online lecture has advantages in terms of tiem and space.
    Next, the quality of lectures is improved. In school, all of the teacher might repeat their lecture in each class every day. If thy try to deliver the same content to all over the class again, it will be time wasting and hard for their mental and health. But, in  online viedo lecture, they can just take a lecture once and upload it at the class site. In this way, all students can attend the same lecture, and the teacher will also try to record a one good lecture. In addition, various video or devices that cannot used in class can be shown through video. Online lecture might be the important point to improve the quality of lectures.
    Last, various class curriculum with using electronic device will be made. Most students use laptops to take online class. In real class, you can't use electronic devices such as laptops, but when taking online classes, you can use useful applications like ""Word"", ""Excel"", ""Geogebra"", or the simulation programm. Also, live lectures is usually short to do complicated jobs or writing report. But in online lecture, there is no time limit so we can do such things as much as you can. 
    Online video lectures has many advantages versus live lectures. You don't need to consider time and space, the quality of lecture is more good, and many complicated works in class with electronic device can be made. How about watching online video lectures"	5	4	3.5	12.5
2131	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"I strongly agrees that there's uncountable benefits exist in computing device such as tablet/laptop computer on classroom.
First, Educational purpose usage of  computing devices can improve studying performance.
Imagine you are writing an essay, and you need to reference a many words as you needed.
Using online dictonary or online tranlsator through these computing devices is much easier and faster than using offline meterial such as dictonary or books.
Like the above case, computing device in classroom can help students by reducing wasted time and unnessesary efforts from studying.
Second,  Quality of educational experiance during lecture can be much higher with computing devices.
The graphical and interactive course meterial constructed for these computing devices can bring  student's attention toward lecture, and encourage students to learn things with new experiances.
Some people says computing devices may can distract the students from the lecture and make students hard to concentrate in the class, and eventually ruins every student's studying chances.
However, with limited and controled usage, that kind of problem can be prevented and computing devices will gives only benefits to the students. 
For these reasons,  I think the computing devices in class has a many valuable advantages that can't be ignored.
Thanks. "	4.5	4	3	11.5
2132	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	" Recently, digital transformation have been occured in the overall lifestyle. The digital transformation means that original analog activities such as face to face transform to process in digital devices like tablet and smartphone. This changes bring that we are able to access any information and knowledge anywhere and anytime. So, now, the era of 4th industry evolution, it is not important to remember information and knowledge. Because whatever you want, you just search and then use in lifestyle. This digital transformation is happening in the education too. We can see that many students usually uses smartphone and tablet in the class. There are a lot of advantages and disadvatages like dillema.
 But, I think that there are more advantages for 2 reasons. First, currently, the ability to create new idea and implement for everyone is requested in society, coporate and academy. As I mentioned above, specially, when we learn, it is not important to just remember. We have to search the information fastly and then create from that information. 
 Second, students must improve digital literacy. The digital literacy means that ability to handle digital information during process of reading and analyzing digital data, and then getting knowledge. The most analog information like books, actual things change to digitizied information in the internet virtual space. So, we spend more time to access digital information in the class.
 To sum up, teaching the usage of smartphone and table in class is more important than forbiddening just that in class, for improving student's digital literacy."	2.5	1	2.5	6
2133	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"Before covid-19, It is rare to use computer in school except collage. However labtop and tablet become usuall things due to covid-19. Although there’re some worries, there are good parts of using computer during class. 
First of all, typing speed in computer is faster than writting down on the paper so we can type lots of lecture content. If we write down the contents of lecture on the paper by hand, it is too slow so that we can’t lost some parts or we can’t focus on current teacher’s speaking.  Lot’s of typed/writtend things during lecture allow students to understand well after the lecture.
Second, we can get various references or contents that help  understanding the lecture by using computer in the class. There must be the time when we can’t understand via only teacher’s talk or contents. If we do not have computer things, we should ask it to teacher. However, when we use computer in class, we can access the internet. Google, wikipida, youtube can be very good second teacher. Google, wikipida, youtube has many contents such as picture, video to help undertanding. Moreover we can choose articles of ‘my type’ in the internet. It covers various qeustion and types of students. 
Last, if we did the lecture with video or zoom, we can see the lecture contents more closer. Before using online tool, it is hard to see the lecture content and teacher’s handwritten things. In this context, lecture with video and zoom is better choice in convinient of student.  Also we can record the lecture and watch the recording again so that improve our understanding. 
In these reasons, using computer devices in class has good parts. "	3	3	3	9
2134	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"Before we talk about the advantages of using a tablet/labtop, what problems will appear in class with only paper books? Let's think about some situations during the class with only books.
First, we may get hard time because of lack of language ability. In many countries including Korea, most of subject books we use in university are written in English. Also, there are universities that their class language is English, such as KAIST. Although English is the most powerful global language, there are many English words or terms in a lot of subject books that are difficult to understand or recognize for students from non-English countries. 
Second, especially in technological scientifical field, most of students cannot remember all of the contents that they learned in previous class. For example, mathematics has very long history and various fields and contents. (e.x. Linear algebra, Statistics, Geometrics, ...etc.) It seems to be very hard to put all of those in our memories even if we learned and used frequently in universities.
So, what can we do with those electronical devices in class? Do they help with those problems above? 
Sure, we can search the internet for lecture contents to help understanding, translate some words or articles, or even do coding during the lecture. It helps students following the lecture more comfortable. Also, some tablet or labtop computer supports the note taking with special electronical pen. Many of lecture resources are uploaded on Internet, note taking with tablet or labtop can reduce the waste of time to print the hard copy of resources. And they are more comfortable to write and erase.
Because of those reasons, I can say that advantages of using a tablet/labtop computer in class help students' comfortable and effective learning."	3.5	4	2.5	10
2135	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"In my thinking, using a tablet/laptop computer help to record,  store and remind lecture contents and search something not familiar very easily. 
First, tablet/laptop computer can handle much more class informations efficiently. If I have only pen and paper in class, I have to write down whole thing to record a lecture. Because the hand-writing is very slow, I experienced it can't be a solution for recording a lecture through my long semesters. Whether than that, using sound recording program in laptop/tablet or typing by laptop keyboard is much more efficient.
Second, if we record information tablet/laptop computer, we can preserve lots of information much easier for a long time. Because the basic class' contents are essential for understanding advanced class, when we go higher level we usually search to see what we learned in basic class. If we record class' contents in piecd of papers, informations will be ruined eventually because they are  just papers. Also, lots of papers are very heavy and have large volume, so it is difficult to store in room.  On the other hand,  If we record in tablet/laptop computer, we don't have to worry about broken of informations what recorded, also we can carry whole things just in light tablet/laptop computer.
Third, if we use tablet/laptop computer,  we can find some difficult jargon's definitions in internet easily. For the perspective of understanding the lecture, understanding definitions of jargons are very important. But, we can found a word what we can't understand it's meaning easily in lecture note. If we can't find out meaning of that word in lecture time, it makes hard to understand lecture from that part. I think tablet/laptop computer can help to find those things, because they can connect to internet, not like a piece of paper.
Because of these reasons, I think that using a tablet/laptop computer can give lots of advantages to understanding a class. "	4	2.5	4	10.5
2136	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"I think using a tablet/ labtop computer in classes is good for everyone who are participate in the class.
There are some reasons why I think like this.
First of all, It make students easy to note something. Before starting a class, almost all professor gave some lecture notes. If we don't use a tablet or labtop computer, although already noted in the lecture note, we must write all things. However, by using this item, we can note them in much shorter time. Download the pdf, and note something in this lecture note. So, students have more time to attend on professor and it makes them understand the class easily.
Second, class efficiency are highly elevated. If students don't use a labtop, quiz or exam must be made of paper. It's time consuming. Just upload a quiz or exam on the site like KLMS. It reduces professors' effort and time. Actually, because of covid19 there are many online lectures and exams. At least for me, it's very comfortable.
Lastly, it can help understanding a class. It can be used as a tool for finding something. In many classes, there are some words that we can't understand instantly. We can type those words and find the meaning or mechanism. In my case, I'm major in biology. So, there are too many difficult words to understand. In that time, finding words make me to understand clearly.
For these reasons, using a tablet/ labtop computer in classes are good for everyone."	4	4	3.5	11.5
2137	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"  Now a days,  many students in university use tablet or laptop. They use it not only for assignment but also in class. It is because using a tablet or laptop in class gives many advantages to students.
  First, we can write professor's words more than hand writting. Using typing, we can wirte what professor talked more fastly so there is less missing words. And we also find out typo and correct it more easily than hand writting. And also we can find out the images or video related to the lecture content and link it to my writing. So we can recall what we learned in this class more easily. 
  Second,  we can search and find contents which professor want to talk to us. When during the lecture sometimes professor forget the name of major or good reference related to class or just lightly refer the name important reference and move on the class. In these kind of situation, if we can search and find what professor tried to deliever to us, the rate of understanding class is much more improved.  And we can also save this references easily to tablet or laptop so it also helpful for study.
  Finally, I think this is the most important and major  advantage of using tablet or laptop, we can use files so no more carrying heavy major books. Most of the major books for university student is so heavy and always we need more than one book. For some case, multiple books are required in one class for reference or additional material. We have to carry all of these books for class everyday and it is really exhausting thing. It is so big problem even one day i brought all the major book for whole day, I have to take a nap instead of lunch. But if we have laptop or tablet, we can just bring it instead of many heavy books or lecture materials. And I also bougth an Ipad recently and I don't need to bring major books and I am feelings my quality of life is improved a lot. 
  For these reasons, most of students using tablet or laptop. Using tablet or laptop in class improve your class wiritting and lose weight that you have to carry. Also with tablet or laptop, It is possible to search the reference simultaniously during the class. Although there could be some disadvantage such as you should care about charging or something I think advantages are so intensive so the disadvantage is not so meaningful. So I also strongly recomand to use tablet or laptop instead of major book."	3	3.5	3	9.5
2138	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"I think there are so many powerful advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class.  I will show important reasons.
First  the main reason is that nowadays, most schools teach student by off-line class but also on-line course. In post-covid19 century , School and university have to find the way that on-line class to avoid covid 19 pandemic. And tablet and laptop computer are most useful tools in this situation. Hence we can take class anytime and anywhere if we acess zoom by these. This is most powerful advantage of using a tablet/laptop in class. 
Second, we already know the power of internet searching and useful apps in class. Some student might note a class  by the tablet, some student quickly search a hard terms of course by internet. Also professor can provide several taste of teaching by using tablet/laptop in class. When I was highschool student, my math teacher allows using a tablet in class. One of his teaching way is solve the math problem by QR code quiz. Student have founded a QR code which is hide at classroom and solve the quiz by tablet. This class made student excited.
However there is also some opnion that disagree wtih using IT tools. Reason is that using the IT tools distract the class. But many scientific essays and news show using a tablet/laptop computer in class is attracting student. 
These are why i think using a tablet/laptop computer in class is so useful. In post-covide 19, using a tablet/laptop in class is not choice. It is essentail."	4.5	4.5	4	13
2139	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"In recent, most of people use machine such as smartphone, laptop, computer, table. And they are accustomed them. Now they use  tablet rather than note and pencil. But in class such as people have to focused to other people like professor or teacher, they are maybe some disturbed their attention. So, in school specially in high school, many people fight about this situation. Some people say, although the tablet helpful for noting but they need to submit them before the class. But student think it is not good choice. So if you, what do you want to choose? 
First, Using laptop  will increase the student's attention. Suppose a student use tablet in class.  When they use the tablet for noting than their study ability is increase according to Korea searching  institution. Because they can search previous noting easily rather than using notes. etc.
Second, when students use the machine, than teacher or professor also good to go the contents of class. Because teachers are also person, when they get question about students they can't focus their class and the mood of class was broken.
Third, If students can use machine, than their study passion will increase.  One of the advantage of using machine is  searching the  word that they don't know. So it will effect positive affection cause of  searching about class contents during the class. Because they can find the thing that they want to know so they feel that they  want to know more and more by  understanding step by step. Actually, when I was high school, I always  sad that teacher can't teach everything contents  that I want to know. But when l entered university, my passion increase to know something deep and deep. Then the feeling lead to up my study and ability to solve the question. So for increasing the own's thinking and searching ability before question to teacher or professor, we  need to use them."	2.5	2	3	7.5
2140	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	" I think using tablet/laptop in class is very useful. Belows are the advantages of using computers in class.

 First, if we use laptop in class, we can freely join to internet environment. Internet or web is defined by a vast connections between informations. So, we can search very old English words or when Issac Newton born and dead. Using internet provides us to release from carrying a heavy encyclopedia.

 Second, laptops and tablets are kind of computers. Therefore, we can use its powerful computing skills. Think about how molecule moves or how does orbital of atom look like. For the scientists in 1800s, They only can infer what equation describes them but not exactly draw. But now, in 2020, thanks to the highly developed CPU and GPU performance, we can exactly draw them in a very short time. Moreover, we can train A.I with few centimeter thick Macbook pro. With computers, we can exactly understand what we learned.

 Third, tablets and laptops give lecturer an easy way to control cheating. Like this pre-test, professor can upload exam file and watching student with SEB and Zoom. Traditional exam let teacher watching students only with two eyeballs. This give tiredness to teacher and is not effiective that much. There are many options to cheat, and noticing all is impossible. So, using electro-devices is a good options to control cheating.

 Last, using electro device is good to environment. In this covid era, buying ipad having been a trend in Korea. The most powerful function of ipad is note taking. Carring heavy text books and take a note in a paper needs tons of wood. To process paper, mankind shave forests and it increase carbondioxide consentration in air. Increased carbondioxide increase temperature. Many of experts point out the global warming by the main reason of climate change. With tablet pc, we do not need papers. Download ebook and take a note on a glass never use papers. Therefore tablet pc are good to environment."	3	2.5	3	8.5
2141	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"At the most serious COVID-19 period, all classes in the world were opened online. According to this, students are using laptop or tablet in class. I think there are  many advantages of using these not only in online class, but also in offline class.
  First, students can search their all of questions in the class immediately. Including me, many students can't understand all of the class, but there are few questions in class. I think the reason is that students think their questions are too easy and they think all students can't give their all of questions during the class time. However, each student can search their own questions on the internet with tablet or labtop. Then, professor can use class time full and all students can solve their lots of questions.
  Second, students can write and save their memo during class safely. Some students make memo for everyday class and use them on individual studying. Suppose that they make it on paper note, then it can be lost, wet, torn easily if the student don't care them everytime. However, if they make it on tablet or labtop, they can get away from managing the papers. They can clear the files with folder system, and freely use it when they individually study.
  Third, Students can move lightly. They have several classes everyday, then they have to carry their thick textbooks. If several classes are continued right away, then students have to run to next classroom with their heavy bags. However, only one tablet or labtop can be instead of the heavy bag. they can save the thick textbooks without additional weight.
  I wrote three advantages of using tablet or labtop in class. It is very helpful for students' comfortable campus life. There will be many advantages for professors too. And I think nobody can't stop this technologically changing life. By developing technology continuously, people will use it to make more efficient and comfortable life."	3	3	3	9
2142	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"Nowdays, many students use their tablet or laptop computer in class. Of course, someone thinks using laptop in class makes students not concentrate to class. However, I think using laptop has more advantages than disadvanates.
 First, tablet and laptop are very convenient. Students do not have only one class for a day, so they need to carry many books, dictionary, notes, and so on. But tablet or laptop can contain these materials at once. Moreover, it is much easy to take and edit a note than real note. Because students don't have to carry such heavy things, they can more concentrate to class. Also, professors have a convenient tools to check the absence or assignment, and give a notice.
 Second, using tablet or laptop is more useful in society. After students in colleges graduate, most of them get a job. In their company, they mostly use computer to make documents or communicate. In addition, some jobs like programmers always use computer to work. Therefore, students have to know how to make documents file clearly or make a code in order to adapt their jobs easily.
Finally, tablet and laptop can use online class. In 2021, most of universes take online classes because of COVID-19. Even if some students can't resist near colleges, they can take a class because class and exam are taken in online. Taking exam or class without going classroom have many advantages. Students can take class everywhere and everywhen, so they can control their schedule more smoothly. 
 By these reasons, I agree with using tablet or laptop in class. tablet and laptop are very convenient to use, have to used in society, and are suitable for online class. I want more laptop-using class to be held."	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5
2143	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"Do you think about using a tablet or laptop computer in class have some advantages? I think it has some good effect. I think using them has advantages for the following three reasons.
First, if we use tablet or laptop computer in class, then we can search more information by the internet. When professor explain about some theory, then a lot of students can't understand one hundred percent about that theory, but if professor go the next step of class, then student don't have some way to get that information. Of course, we can ask someone at the end of class, but at that time we don't have a way to get some knowledge. So when we use tablet or laptop computer for internet search, then we can plus our knowledge quickly and we are able to follow the next step of class.
Second, we use them in lecture, then it is easy to prepare that class. When we don't have tablet or laptop, then we have to print the lecture note or we have to carry all the books what is need for that time. But we use these ones, we don't need to do that. We can put the pdf file into them, then it is easy to move or get ready for the class. Additionally, when we use electrocities it is more comfortable to take note. We can fix my note taking easily, use typing or copying some picture or graph etc. then it can save our note taking time, so we can more pay attention to the class.
Finally, when we use tablet or laptop computer in lecture, it is easier to do team project. When we use some these devices, then it is easier to collect many informations and share about them. Also by getting each role, they can finish more quickly. When they have to present or analyse some experience data, if they use power point, excel etc. then they are able to get higher quality result about that lecture.
For these reasons, I think using a devices in class has some advantages. So at class, when should use a tablet or laptop computer."	4	4.5	4	12.5
2144	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"I think that there are several advantages of using computer in class.
Firstly, students can be free from heavy backpacks. To comprehend well and write somethings about lectures, students should bring their books, or printed lecture note. Usually, books for university lectures are very thick and heavy. If students use computers in their classes, they can read books through laptops or tablets. They should bring only 'one' computer for every classes.  It is very convinient.

Secondly, students can save environment. If they cannot use computers in their classes, they should print out all things needed in class. So, a lot of paper is used. And  it is not good for environmental condition. So I think that using computers instead of lots of paper, is very efficient for our future.

Finally, students can search on internet  some knowledges which they didn't understand clearly. They do not need to remember which parts were hard or complicated. They can solve their difficulty instantly. However, this can also bring a big disadvange of using computers in class. Some students can spend time by searching things those are not related to lecture. 

In these days, most university students use laptops or tablets. Those are very convinient, but sometimes make students do not concentrate on thier class. So I think it is importent to student use computers wisely.   Without good mindset of students, I think that usage of computers in classes should not be allowed, even there are lots of advantages."	4	4	4	12
2145	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	" Since COVID-19, we have used laptop or tablet in class because we must take a lecture in non-meet. During 2 years, we use laptop and tablet, so this is mordern and friendly phenomenon. However, I think it is useful to use tablet or laptop in class without corona. It have many advantage.

 First, we can study more effiencific. we can researh concept or problem what I can't understand. So, we can reduce Q&A time. because, we can get answer of easy questions by Internet. then, we can ask more difficult question what we can't find answer of question in Internet. And if we can't hear lecture short time because of sleeping or other thinking, we can watch a lecture one more time right now.

 Second, It is more handful to use laptop or tablet. If we don't have a laptop or tablet, we should take a heavy bag what have a lot of books. But if we use laptop or tablet, we don't need to have a heavy bag becasue we can download file of book in laptop or tablet. And if someone have a important notice, they can deliver notice fast and exactly.

 Finally, we can do various activity by using laptop or tablet. If we use computer, we can do more activities like kahoot and Alice, etc. And, when we take a test, if question is choose type, we can score more fast than not use internet. 

 For these threee reasons, I think using laptop or tablet is good and helpful for study."	3.5	4	3	10.5
2146	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"Nowadays many students use tablet/laptop in their classes. Actually me and almost of my friends use my i-Pad and laptop in classes. There are some reasons that why we should use tablet/laptop in classes.
 First, tablets and laptops are more convenient to bring it. I heard that the books that we usually use in college are almost 2kg. But the weight of tablet is less than 1kg and nowadays the laptops are also less than 1kg. It is the most important reason that why we use it in our classes. And also the volume of tablets and laptops are very small so we can use cross back which is a type of small backs to bring them. On the other hand, the backpacks are not enough to put our all book that we need in our one day classes.
 Second, we can search informations and access our past work and assignments in everywhere and every time we want. In classes, sometimes professor asks us about the contents in the past lecture. But we cannot memorize all of them. So, if we use tablet or laptops in our class, then we can find some informations that we need and also can find some words that we couldn't understand. It might make the students study harder and pay more attention to the lecture.
 Third, we can save more resources by using tablets or laptops. In my case, I used about 500pages of A4 paper in second semester. It is a huge amount of resources. In addition, I used about 10 black pens and many erasers. But if we use tablets, then we don't need it. In tablet, we can make almost infinitely many pages and there is no limit amounts of pen so we can study forever without buying papers and pens. I think it is great advantage of using tablets and laptops in class.
 To sum up, I think it is better to use tablets or laptops in class. I know it is fact that there are some problems when we use it in class, but it is just for some bad students. For the three reasons that I talked above, I think using tablet/laptop in class might help students to study harder in various ways."	3	3.5	2.5	9
2147	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"After COVID, many of student use laptop or tablet to study in online class. There were many trouble to adopts lots of offline things to online class. But today, student and teacher succesfuly make study in online class. Also, many student and teacher could find out advantages of using tablet/laptop in class. 


First, we can use tablet or laptop for make lecture note. It is well know fact that typing or using tablet is faster then using paper note. Before COVID, in university, many student use laptop or tablet fjor making their notes. They use paper note when they are high school student. But many student changed using laptop or tablet for fast typing and writing. Also, in university, many professor make their own lecture presentation and lecture note. And also some professor share it with online. Using tablet for summary lecture on lecture note is one of best way to study in today. For school than before undergraduate, many student don't have experience that using tablet in class. If they use tablet  once, i think student's mind will be change.

Second, Using Iaptop and tablet can make lots of expreriment class. For my high school, many science class use laptop for calculate and summary science experiment or simulate science experiment. Since all student have their own laptop, We can experient lots of experiment that can't in school science class. My favorite laptop experiment was space simulation. For example we can caliberate star's light and color. If it was offline experiment, we have to go nation-level space center and we have to borrow it. But thanks to space simulator, we can find and calculate it with out laptop.

Finally, it make collaborate easy for student. For todays class, many student use google docs or office 365 for collaborate each other. We can make report and presentation very easy than before. Many class use student presentation to their class. So, It will be very helpful for class. 

After COVID-era, I thinks lots of school use laptop or tablet in offline class too. laptop  and tablet have disadvatage like student playing game in class time . But in offline class, it can make synergy effect of online class and using IT devices."	4	4	3	11
2148	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"When I was in highschool, teacher disagrees with using tablet in the class. But several months later, teacher accepted our opinoins to use tablet in the purpose of study. So when I was in highschool, I saw many students who use tablet in the class. Based on my experience, I will give advantages about using electronic devices in class.
 First, We don't need to carry heavy books all time. In my highschool, We used major books which are used in University. Carring many heavy major books every day was very hard for students. If we use tablet instead, We don't need to. We can just carry our electronic devices to our class. Furthermore, We don't need to buy expensive books. We can just get the pdf file on the internet instead.
 Second, Taking notes from the class is lot better than using paper. Using several function in the notes application in tablet, we can easily make study notes rather than taking notes in paper. Also, when we want to study for exam, we can just open the note anywhere with our tablet. 
 Third, we can do various class using electronic devices. For example, We can share each others solutio for the probelm and talk about it. Or, We can use various applications such as Geogebra, Wolframalpha, Excel to analyze data and make a result. We can't do such things in hand.
 In conclusion, there are three advantages while using tablet/laptop in class. We don't need to buy and carry books, make more better notes in class to study, and can do various activities in class. I saw the news about some elementary schools that uses tablet instead of textbooks. As technology advances, our class also have to change. Allowing electronic devices in school in class will be the best first way to do. "	4.5	3.5	3	11
2149	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	" In these days, there are many students who use tablet or laptop instead of subject books and notes in class.
I think every classmate I met before has a tablet or a laptop or either. 
Why they prefer to use a tablet or a laptop instead of books and notes?
What are the advantages of using that?
Being the one of the student using tablet and laptop in class, and the one of the person believes using tablet and laptop is better than using books and notes, I'm gonna tell you about it.


    The first reason why I think using tablet and laptop is efficient is 'light-weight'.
In campus life before using tablet or laptop, we had to bring all the books and notes about some lectures of the very day.
You know that, because the books are very thick and heavy, walking or running with bags that includes many books are exhausted.
But, using tablet and laptop, we can carry all the books in them; Their total weight are not larger than 3kg in general.
So, wherever, whenever, taking the tablet and laptop, we can see the books, watch some lecture, and taking notes.


   The second reason is that it's easy to edit and understanding.
In iPad, there are awesome note application such as GoodNotes, Notability...
Using apps I reffered, students can make their own notes very well, because the apps have many pencils, markers and 
copy-paste, recording function.
Students can take advantages of recording function, they can remind the lecture or edit their lecture notes, listening the lecture again.
(There must be the professor's agreement of recording)
And students can paste the image of lecture notes or subject books, so, they can creating their notes better than in traditional way.


   Because of the reasons above, using laptop and tablet is very helpful to student.
I think there will be more students using tablet and laptop in class because of these reasons."	4.5	4	3	11.5
2150	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I think it is fact that everyone agree with that KAIST is great university at many point of views. However, it is also fact that we cannot satisfied with this university at all of the points. Some students may complain about location, policy and transportation about KAIST, and they would want to change them. Among them, I would change something about cafeterias in KAIST. First of all, all of the cafeterias in KASIT are far away from the Mir building which I'm living in. Western and Nothern cafeterias are the least far away from here, and they are at 10 minutes - distance. It means if I want to eat meal inside of KAIST, I have to use 20minutes to walk. Because of this, many students in Mir building often pass the meal, and this fact may affect on students' health. Next, the costs of them are not cheap enough. In other universities, there are some cafeterias that provide healthy foods with cheap price. They are usually 2 or 3 thousands won. However, our cafeterias are usually came from outside, so they are quite more expensive than others. They are at least 6000won. To summarize, our present cafeterias in KAIST are quite difficult to go there and expensive. These facts affect students bad. Based on these reasons I want to change our university's cafeteria if I can."	3.5	4	4.5	12
2151	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST should improve KAIMARU

  KAIMARU is the food court in the north of KAIST. There are many dormitories near the KAIMARU, so lots of students eat their meal in KAIMARU. I also live in the north dormitory, so I often go KAIMARU to eat lunch or dinner. However, many students say that KAIMARU need to be improved. And I agree with the students that do not satisfy to KAIMARU with three reasons.
  First, KAIMARU is expensive and have bad taste. Of course, KAIMARU is little bit cheaper than other restaurant outside. For example, cafeteria costs 4500 won, so it can be good choice to students. However, some food courts in KAIMARU, they are expensive. Some menus are cost more than 8000 won, so we can not say they are cheap. I think that student restaurant should cheaper than outside restaurant, but some menus in KAIMARU are not. One another problem is those menus are not delicious. It means KAIMARU is not delicious as outside restaurant but expensive as outside restaurant.
  Second, students have no choice. For students live in the north dormitory, they have no choice for other restaurant. There are Lotteria and Subway, but these are not good for health. When the students want to go restaurant outside the school, they should walk for at least 15 minutes. Lunch time in KAIST is an hour, so they should spend 30 minutes of their lunch time for just walking and I think it is waste of time. However, we can not save our time while we go to KAIMARU. Still many students go to KAIMARU, so they should wait for a long time to eat. 
  Third, food courts of KAIMARU do not work on weekend. Therefore, students are hard to have a meal on weekend. They can not cook in dormitory, so they should go outside or eat delivery food. When students go outside, they need to spend lots of time. When students eat delivery food,  it is too expensive. Of course the cafeteria in KAIMARU works on weekend but not every time of weekend. I think KAIMARU should work at least Saturday for student.
  To summarize, KAIST should improve KAIMARU for three reasons. KAIMARU is expensive as other restaurant but not delicious, students have no choice, and KAIMARU do not work on weekend. Having a meal is very important for students. So I think these problems can give lots of stress to students. Therefore, I think KAIST should improve KAIMARU."	4	4.5	4	12.5
2152	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"The first thing I want to change is the timing when I entered the dormitory. Because of the Covid, KAIST's students had to make choices if they would enter the dormitory on spring semester on 2021. My answer was 'no', and I sometimes regret that I did not join the dormitory at march. At that time, I had some bad thoughts about moving to other cities, so I did not join the dormitory.
 The first reason is that I missed the chance to enter some great circles. I once had a dream to join V.O.K., the broadcasting circle of KAIST, because I dreamed the be an announcer, but I just missed my chance. And what I really regret is that V.O.K. is a really great circle to make good friends. I have some friends at V.O.K., and they say they never regret that they joined V.O.K., since they made good friends, and they made some good memories. I just missed my dream because I was just worried about moving, so I still regret about it.
 For the second reason, I missed the chance to enjoy the freshman's life. At the spring semester, Daejeon did not have time limit of the bars due to Covid, and many friends enjoyed eating and drinking near KAIST. So, it is a little pity that I had lots of time, but I could not enjoy that time with my university friends.
 Finally, I regret that I could not spend more time with my roommate. I met him at the fall semester, and he was also my roommate since spring. He really is a nice guy, and I feel sad that I could have spend more time with him as a roommate if I join the dormitory earlier. Now he is a proctor for our new freshmen, so I could not be his roommate again. He gave me great advice when I felt hard, and he helped me to make my university life better, so he is one of the biggest reason that I did not join the dormitory at march. 
 If I go back to the spring semester in 2021, I would definitely join the dormitory to join the V.O.K, enjoy the freshman's life, and to meet my great friend."	5	4.5	4	13.5
2153	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"One thing I want to change about KAIST
    When I asked my friends who are not KAIST students to show their time-table, I was shocked because their time-table looks free. All of their classes held on different time, and some classes end at 6 pm. KAIST has very formal time-table. Almost every classes starts at 9 am, 10:30 am, 1 pm, and 2:30 pm. Also they end up together. Plus, same classes are pair like Monday and Wednesday. Some students think it is our university's advantage, but I disagree. If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I would change the formal time-table for these three reasons.
    First of all, lots of classes start and finish together has many disadvantage. For example, lunch time is between second and third classes. So every students has to wait for a line, eat, and brush their teeth in just one hour. Moreover, line for lunch is very long, so they have to wait for more than 20 minutes. Also, before class starts, many students want to ride OLEV. Every classes start together, so there are a lot of students in OLEV just before the classes. Hence, some students can not ride it. 
    Second, it ruins balance of time. Many classes held on Monday to Thursday. Usually, there are no class on Friday. Also, classes end up at least 4 PM except advanced English classes, and no classes after 4 pm. Students have to finish all their lectures during 4 days, so it is very hard. If time-table would be more free, students could take lecture for 5 days, or late time. It could reduce students' stress of study. 
    Lastly,  schedule of test is too tight for some students. Because regular classes' schedule is formal, exams' schedule is formal too. So, some exams can start right after the another exams. For instance, a class which starts at 1 pm, its exam start at 1 pm and end at 3:45 pm. Another class which starts at 2:30 pm, its exam start at 4 pm. Then student has only 15 minutes to prepare the next exam. 
    To summarize, formal time-table makes tight schedule, and ruins balance of time. In this aspect, I strongly support the idea for change our school's time-table. "	4	4.5	4.5	13
2154	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I can change one important thing about KAIST, I will develop around the university. Since 2000, Daejeon improved dramatically as well as KAIST. But still, I think around KAIST should be developed a lot. I think there are three reasons.
First of all, there are nothing to enjoy without alcohole. In Googdong and Auendong, only bar exist. So, students can easily drink alchole and harm their health. Drinking alchole can make cancer for people. But most of student do not think about It. If we develop around KAIST and make playground without alchole, then young student will drink less alchole and they can improve their grade and health.
Second, In KAIST, traffic is not good. There are no train to going KAIST. So students will pay a lot to using taxies. It is big problem to students because students do not have many money. If there exist train station at KAIST, It can reduce student's money a lot. It can improve student's well being as well as KAIST's well being.
Finally, If we can develop around KAIST, student can meet many kind of peoples. I think meet people and learning society skills is improtant as well as class. Untill developing KAIST, other people do not come to KAIST. So students can not meet non-KAIST people. Then, I think school will be isolate. I think young people like college students should meet varity people from developing around KAIST.
In conclusion, I think I will develop around KAIST because of the above reasons. Developing spend a lot of money, but It has more benefits than harms. Because college stundents shuold enjoy without alchole, spand less money using traffic, meet many people. So if I can change one thing KAIST, I will develop around KAIST."	5	4	4.5	13.5

          If I could change one important think about KAIST, I would eliminate the tests. I think tests have more disadvantages than advantages. I am going to tell you three reasons why I want to eliminate the tests.
           First, students get stressed by tests. According to mental health research, the first reason of suicide of students is a test. This shows students really get stressed by tests. Evaluating students is not important than mental health of them. So, the tests should be eliminated.
           Second, tests make students to focus on their grade not the development. They just study to get good grade in tests and they do not study the contents that not in the tests. This is not mach with the purpose of university. University should help students to study the part which they are interested in. However, they do not have enough time to study interesting parts because they should study for the tests. This is a terrible side effect of test.
            Lastly, test is not the best way to makes students study. I can see many students that study only a week before the tests. It is not good for students. So, I think we should eliminate tests and make more group activities. While talking with other students, students can develop their own skills and knowledges. If we have group activities once a week, it will be much better than study only a week in a total semester.
             To sum up, I want to eliminate the test in KAIST because it gives stress to students, makes students to focus on their grade and is not the best way to makes students study. I hope there is no test in KAIST."	5	4.5	4.5	14

     KAIST has many dormitories. But, Many students have complains about dormitory. KAIST is the best engineering university in Korea. Considering KAIST name value, KAIST does not have good dormitory.  There are two specific reasons why we need to change dormitory in KAIST.
      First of all, bathrooms and toilets are poor. Some rooms have their own bathroom or toilet. But, many rooms do not have their own bathroom or toilet. Students who are taken these rooms use bathroom and toilet which are outside the room together with other students. This system make students uncomfortable. In KAIST community app, some students said, ""I do not want to use bathroom or toilet with other students. It is very uncomfortable for me."". So, our university should change every rooms has their own toilet and bathroom.
     Second, there are noise problem. In statistics, about 52% students have noise problem. Many students in the dormitory spend hard time especially at night. They want to go to sleep, but some roommates and other rooms' students make noise. There are two cases which make noise problems at night. One is that some students have a party such as drinking and watching soccer game with other rooms' students together in one room at night. Second is that roommates play game or study at night. So, our university should change dormitory rule strict and change dormitory structure more efficient to defend noise between each rooms.
     To summarize, there are two reasons why we should change dormitory in KAIST. First reason is that most students are uncomfortable about bathrooms and toilets. Second reason is that most students are uncomfortable about noise problem especially at night. So, I hope our university change every rooms has their own toilet and bathroom, change dormitory rule strict and change dormitory structure more efficient to defend noise between each rooms quickly."	5	5	4.5	14.5

I have been at KAIST for 2 years. what I feel during living in the school is people in KAIST are very personal. So if I could change one important thing about my university, I will change more friendly with each people in our university. I have some reason for that. First of all, I think our university has to make more situation for talking with other students in KAIST. Students in our university not had major at first grade. So they had to make friends in group which the university made. But, friends who made this group can not have relationship for long time. because students in same group will choose different major at two grade. I think make place where can make friends in same major.  So, our university are more friendly with each other. Second,  if our university will change to have more situation that students make relationship with other students, students maybe study harder and make success more. I think people in team have more power than a person. So I think our university make time for making a team and solving some problems.

    KAIST is well made university. It is well developed, smart, and helpful to study. However, if I could change one important thing about my university, KAIST, I have an opinion. One thing that should be changed in KAIST is the bike roads. They are not much, and they should be increased. There are three reasons why.
    First, current roads are too dangerous for bike riders. There are no exact bike roads in some places in KAIST. For example, the west side of KAIST. There are student dormitories, and many students use bikes. However, there are no bike roads. The bycicle riders should use car roads, and this cituation seems to be very dangerous. The crash could be happened.
    Second, the lack of bike roads also occurs the dangerous situations to the KAIST students who walk around. There are no much bike roads, so some bike riders use the blocks. It makes dangerous situations, and people walking on KAIST could be injured. Therefore, the bike roads should be increased.
     Finally, the increase of bike roads helps the students to move the classes. If the bike roads are increased, it is easier to ride a bike on KAIST. Therefore, students are easier to move around the class to class, because riding bike is much faster than just walking, and it tends to be very helpful.
    In conclusion, the bike roads on KAIST should be increased because of the crash problems on the car roads and the blocks, and the speed advantage of moving around the university. I hope the bike roads are increased and students are more likely to ride bikes."	3.5	4	4	11.5

     All universities have their own problems in many aspects, so students in universities want to get rid of those disadvantages. This is also applied to KAIST,  so many students in KAIST are uncomfortable for KAIST's problems. There are obviously many shortcomings that they feel bad, but I think the small number of restaurants which sell healthy food in its campus is the most serious problem of KAIST. There are two main reasons standing behind this.
     The first reason is that most of students in KAIST are living in dormitories. Diffrent from other univerisities, most of students in KAIST are not living in Daejeon, so they have to live in dormitories. For students in dormitories, they should eat in restaurants which are in KAIST campus because restaurants outside of campus is too far to visit in the morning or in the lunch time.  However, currently, there are only few restaurants in KAIST campus which sell low salt and low calory food like rice bowl and non-fried meat, so many students in KAIST who usually visit to restaurants in KAIST campus because of living in dormitories cannot stay healthy easily. They have to put more efforts or money to maintain healthy states comparing with students in other universities, and this is
 huge disadvantage.
     The second reason is that inefficiency for exercising. Currently, the interests for exercising are increasing among young people, so many students in KAIST also want to exercise and make muscle. However, in KAIST, students have a big difficulty to get healthy food such as chiken breast, boiled egg, and many kinds of vegetables because there are few restaurants that sell them. Therefore, they have to pay additional money to buy them, and it cause inefficiency for exercising to students.
     In conclusion, small number of healthy food restaurants is the most serious problem of KAIST because of health issues for students living in dormitories and inefficiency for exercising. Therefore, If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I will increase the number of healthy food restaurants in campus. "	5	4.5	4	13.5

Nowadays, many college students do something to achieve their goals. In my case, I want to participate in a lot of events in KAIST to enjoy a campus life. So, if I could change one important thing about KAIST, I would like to make events and festivals more for some reasons.
First of all, events and festivals can make college students more active. Of course, the clubs of KAIST relevant to events do many things, but if there are events and festivals more, we can participate in them, and enjoy participating in events with our friends, or other students. this helps us to make friends and be active more.
Second, many events and festivals help us to relieve stress. In KAIST, most students are good at a scientific research and skill.To be skillful in their field, students study hard. While doing research, they are likely to be hard. To prevent this, many events and festivals in university help students to relieve stress about research in many ways, such as sport games, singing contest, etc.
Finally, many events and festivals can give chances to boast our university, KAIST. SNS, such as instagram, and facebook, is very famous for noticing something in daily life. If there are many events and festivals in KAIST, the clubs which are relevant to festivals can boast KAIST. And then, there can be chances to notice KAIST for people, and

        Since I came in KAIST, I have thought that KAIST is pretty good college. I satisfy my university sufficiently. If I must choose one thing that I want to change in KAIST, nevertheless, my choice is the region of our college. On the other hand, I think it would be much better that KAIST is in Seoul. While I discussed about this topic with my friends, I got several reasons which support my opinion.
        The first reason is the traffic in Seoul is more comfortable. Before I came in Daejeon, I lived in  Gwang-Myeong which is nearby Seoul. So, I realized the subway of Seoul is the best vehicle that college students can use. However, the subway of Daejeon is too less to move the place I want to arrive. There are just one line in Daejeon. In contrast, there are more than 9 lines in Seoul. 
        Second, there are many places where we can play in Seoul. I think Daejeon is less exciting city than Seoul. When I was in Seoul, I could go to many places such as other universities festival to play. However, I have done same thing like going PC room and drinking alcohol in Daejeon in my case. In addition, I can meet my friends that I met in my secondary school. in Seoul. 
        Finally, it is hard to get along with other college students in Daejeon. In Seoul, there are many universities and they are close enough to meet together. But, KAIST is nearby Chungnam university and we can meet them only. I think the people that we meet are too limited. If KAIST is in Seoul, there are more chances that we can meet other college students.

       I know it is hard changing the site of KAIST. However, I don't have another thing that I dislike my college. I just imagine if KAIST is in Seoul. I think the advantage of traffic and many places which is interesting and so on is the reasons which support my "	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5

     Many KAIST students live at the westside dormitories such as Huimang-Hall and Dasom-Hall. There are two ways to go Westside dormitory. One is from North through the Endless-load, and the other one is from South through KISTI. Some students who live in Westside dormitories, especially Huimang-Hall, ask to make a tunnel which through Eoun-Mountain. What is advantages from the tunnel?
     First of all, the time to go to the most KAIST campus building from the Westside decrease. Many students who live in the Westside dormytories walk around the mountain to go to the campus buildings that are rocated at the Northside and Eastside of KASIT. However, if there is the tunnel through the mountain, the walk time is surprisingly decrease. For example, when a student walk from W8 to Huimang-Hall, it takes about more than 10 minutes, but if the tunnel is rocated to connect W8 to Huimang-Hall, it decrease to about less than 2 minutes.
     Second, the tunnel can be the landmark of the KAIST. There are no university that has own tunnel in its campus in Korea. If the tunnel is made, KAIST become the first university which has the own underground civil engineering structure. It raises the honor of the Civil and Environmental Engineering department and can be the chance to be famous. 
    Finally, the usage of tunnel is various. The tunnel work not only as the walkway, but also as the place of convergence. SInce the tunnel do not need the viechel road, students can use the large place like busking place. In the Korea regulation, the width of tunnel is about 6m, and the two way walkroad is about 2m. The 2m from the edge can be used freely, and creative students in KAIST can use it creatively.

"    In our university, we have a lot of components such as dormitory and classes. Since we live in our dormitory, the dormitory is the most important part of our school life. However, there are many problems because of the lack of the trashcan capacity. In my opinion, extending the trashcan in dormitories can improve our university life.
    First, we can live more clear with the extended trashcan. We live in the dormitory with the various bugs and flies currently due to the spiled foods, and the spiled foods are occured by the lack of the trashcan capacity. Moreover, the trashcan and the spiled things are lied in front of the restroom where we clean our body. Thus, with the extended trashcan,  we can achieve the clearness of our life in dormitory.
    Second, we can have our food without any restriction. Especially in weekend, we do not have anyone who clear the trashcan, and students use the delivery system because the students' restaurant do not open. However, if we have the delivery foods, there are no trashcan to put the trashes off. Therefore, we need more trashcan to have our food freely.

We can enter dormitory any time, meet international friends, see beautiful creatures including ducks and etc. However, if I have a chance of changing only one important thing about my university, I want to delete grade criteria for scholarship and give scholarship to every undergraduate students. There are two reasons for this.
    First, students can experience various things without concern about money and grade. Of course, students can do various things  like traveling, studying English, or enjoying hobbies even if they study hard and get a scholarship.  However, If scholarship has a grading criteria, students can not only focus on what they interest in because of concern about money and grade. Deleting grade criteria for scholarship can fully erase burden about money of students and can make students concentrate on their interest. 
    Second, students who have less money can concentrate on study in positive circulation. Students in poor must find scholarship. If they do not get scholarship, they have to work in rest time or find other scholarship and it makes them busy. So, if they once fail to get a scholarship, they become busier, and it is not a good circulation.  However, if we delete grade criteria, students do not need to think about part-time work or other scholarship. So, even if they once fail to get a good grade, they can focus on study again with a great concentration. And it makes a positive circulation.
    To sum up, deleting grade criteria for scholarship have two great benefits that makes student concentrate on their interest and study. So we have to delete grade criteria for scholarship."	4.5	4.5	4	13

    KAIST is a university full of many students with passion to study. Many students work hard for better grades, but sometimes some students claim their grading is not reasonable. In KAIST, the majority of the students consider it is particularly hard to get better grades contrast to other universities in Korea, for instance, Seoul National University and POSTECH. In my opinion, the grading system in KAIST is mostly acceptable, but there are some parts that make the KAIST students difficult to accept them. Therefore, I think the grading systems need to change in certain parts. My opinion is supported by the following reasons.
    First, there are some cases that KAIST's grading systems could become a handicap for the students who takes the lecture for the first time, but it becomes an advantage for the ones who are taking it once more.  In KAIST, it is possible for the students who got a grade lower than B- to take the lecture again and make the grade better. Although these students could have maximum grade of A-, I think it is one of the good systems for the students who think they took a lecture too early. I do not oppose to this system, but I think the problem is in the other place. The grading system grades the students equally regardless they are taking the lecture again or not, and then the system drops the grades of the students that are taking the lecture once again. Therefore, it is possible for the students who took the lecture for the first time to compete with the students who already have experience about the lecture. This can possibly make no students getting A+ at all. In my opinion, grading with different standards are going to be needed.
    Second, I think the attendance grading must be unified among classes. In some lectures in KAIST, there are multiple classes managed by different professors due to the large number of the students. This often leads to different grading policy of attendance, and it creates some cases students could possibly be confused of. For example, some classes of calculus does not check the attendance and apply full score on attendance, but some classes apply attendance scores scored by submitting quizzes and assignments. by the difference of the policy, some students in the former class often take penalty from the final grade. Even though students in the former class received better grades on the exams, sometimes the benefits  of the full attendance score affects less than the later class students who got full attendance score. Because of this, students with higher total score can possibly receive lower grades than the students with lower total scores. In order to prevent confusion and maintain acceptable competition, I claim to unify the grading systems of attendance score among classes.
    Finally, I think ambiguous grading standards must be avoided. In specific lectures, it is possible to find several ambiguous grading policies not clearly explaining how grading will be. For instance, some grading policies from history lectures, there was a policy grading essay, saying ""improvements contrast to the past will be graded higher."" It is not certain how to learn or know to be better, but it only gave the students an abstract understandings. In order to lead the students to know how to improve, I think these policies are needed to be avoided as possible.
    To summarize, I personally think KAIST's grading systems have several issues to fix. Changing the grading policies for the students who are taking a lecture once more, unifying the attendance grading among different classes, and announcing clear and unambiguous grading policies would have a chance to help achieving this. As a student of KAIST, I do not think KAIST's grading system has a big flaw, but I want to say fixing several issues could make this university's standard in a higher level, and make it possible for the students of KAIST to study in a better condition."	5	4.5	4.5	14

     My university KAIST is known as a school which has a brilliant student and an academic system. In fact, most students in KAIST that are including me are satisfied with an overall life of the university. Most people may think that there are nothing for KAIST to change. However, as there are no perfect universities, I think that KAIST has one important thing to change. In my opinion, if I could change one important thing about KAIST, then I want to change things about the school cafeteria. There are three reasons why I hope to change the school cafeteria. First of all, the qualities of food are low. Of course, since the prices are not expensive, we have to consider the qualities in terms of prices. Despite the price, the tastes are not so good. For example, the fried food is too greasy, and for some cases, meals are not cooked well. Second, there are too many restaurants related to snacks, not meals. Most of the KAIST students live in dormitories, so they often eat lunch at a school cafeteria. However, there are a variety of cafeteria about salad, hamburger, or sandwiches. Foods of these stores are just simple snacks, so students who want to eat meal and to feel full should go to a specific cafeteria. Then the places are so crowded, and they have to be waiting for lunch for a long time. Third, the condition of school cafeteria is not clean as much. For example, when I ate lunch at a school cafeteria, the hair and some unsatisfied things are found. These things make students feel worse, and even cause them to have a stomachache. In conclusion, one crucial thing I want to change is about the cafeteria of KAIST because of low qualities, concentration of school cafeteria about meal, and the bad conditions. I think that it would be better if KAIST changes the overall cafeteria system."	5	5	4.5	14.5

     There are many universities in Korea. And each university has different characteristics. For example, Seoul University is in Seoul, and the tuition expanse is cheap, and Yonsei University has a big contest called ""Akaraka"". In the case of KAIST, it has great good things that the tuition expense is cheap, and this university is the best engineering school in our country. However, If I can change one important thing about my university, I should change the location of my university to Seoul. There are three reasons

     First of all, KAIST students cannot play well in Daejeon. In the other words, if they want to play, they can just go to the place selling alcohol. In the case of Yonsei University, it is located in Seoul. So, if they want to play, they can go to the escape room, for example, a pretty cafe, an event shopping mall. There are many things to play in Seoul. Students get lots of stress in KAIST. Therefore, if the location is in Seoul, students may be happier.

     Second, a festival is too small. In the other words, we cannot call celebrities in our school because of the location. If we want to call one celebrity in my university contrast to universities in Seoul, the expanse is more expensive more than three times. The festival is one of the big events in university, and this can reduce students' stress. Also, through play together with KAIST students, they can make more friends and have fun at KAIST.

     Lastly, the transportation in Daejeon is uncomfortable. In Daejeon, there is just one metro course. And there are fewer buses in the Daejeon. This means that if we want to go to other places to play, we should ride a taxi because the transportation is too uncomfortable. So, the transportation expanse is too expensive. This leads the students in KAIST cannot go to other places and just play near the KAIST. This can be a stress for students.

     In conclusion, there are some difficulties in KAIST because of the location. Students cannot play well, a festival is too small, and the transportation in Dajeon is uncomfortable. And this leads stress to students. Therefore, if I can change one important thing about my university, I want to change the location of my university to Seoul."	4.5	4.5	4	13

You may, but I as freshman felt that making foreign friends is a kind of difficult thing. That's why I suggest the new project that foreign and we can meet in various ways. There're two reasons why I think like that. 
  First, in our side, we can develop our thinking of the world by communicating with foreign students. It  is sure that people in different environment have different ideas. And in different country, there're many other things we can't imagine. Therefore the communication with foreign will surely improve our understanding skills of other thing. And this development will give us flexibility when we face the result we don't intend in many situation. 
  Second, in foreign students side, they can adapt KAIST more easily. We can see many foreign students who come along just with foreign friends. And I also saw a writing of foreign student who think his or her school life was not that good and felt isolation. But imagine other international school in other country. There're so many foreign people and there's no separation between native and foreign. We should try to make this state so that foreign students satisfy with their school life and can focus on their study well.

I think agining system of our country has some unreasonable and uncomfortable aespects.  I would change aging system of our country, If I could change this. 

First of all, korean aging system is different from most of other countries such as US, UK, and etc. I like to watch football game, and I often research about age of some players. When I compare between foreign players and korean players, it's always confusing to compare between two. Also,  It would be problem when I make foreign friens or conversate with them.  

Lastly,  I think this system is unreasonable at point of biological view. In Korea, there are many forbiding system such as alcohol, driving, smoking and etc. I think these forbiding systems are based on biological reasons. Because age get 0 at the starting of born in foreign language system,  these systems are more accurate in biological point of view.

 Second, since the system is concentrated in Seoul, the real estate in Seoul has a super high price than other part of our country. It is almost impossible to have an apartment in Seoul without debt. The price is getting higher and higher in Seoul, but other part's price is getting lower and lower.
 Third, since Seoul is a super city, many people wants to live in Seoul, so other parts of our country is getting not much attention and doesn't evolve. It is one of the biggest problem which makes Seoul more super, and makes other part more weaker.
 So, because of these reasons. I want other parts to evolve."	2	2	2	6
2172	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Recently I watched Netflix Drama which talk about laws for young students. Korea have a special laws for them. Eventhough someone who is younger than 14 years old did illegal things,  they don't get same penalty as adult. It is because,  some people think they are too young to consider and behave right way.  In my opinion, at least middle school students know everything, which is right and wrong. So, if I could change one thing about my country, I would like to reinforce laws for young students. Today, I will give my opinions and two reasons for it.
First,  they have to regret for long time. I think now a days law do not make criminals to regret. They just get volunteer work 40 hours like that. It is not enough to them to think what they did, and how their behave influence to others. Lack of regret time, they would do same things again, or getting worse.  In my opinion they have to get heavier work and time for their sins.
Second, someone who got illegal things to them or their family have to feel less sadness. When they heard students just get short time for volunteer, they feel failure. They thought or expect students to get right time in there and feel regret, sorry to them. But laws just forgive them, eventhough they didn't. 
For these two reasons, I hopefully want to change laws about boys and girls.  For someone who get illegal things to students and student's better future laws have to get heavier.  "	3	2.5	2	7.5

My oppinon of college is school that going to study harder, and highschool should teach personality as well as study. But highschool's study is harder than college, and student's don't have enough time to meet friends, and communicate with other person. So, I storngly recommand that we should make easier highschool study, and we need to increase testing personality of student. In college, we should decrease test difficert when going to college and increase test difficert when graduating the college. "	2.5	2.5	2	7

"I don’t know when it starts but, I feel there are many hatreds in our country now. If we see the SNS like facebook or instagram, we can easily find the fighting situation. I want to change this culture of modern society of Korea for two reasons.


First, hatreds can be developed to crime. We can find the news about crimes because of the hatred such as assaulting old man or woman. Like this, hatreds can create crimes against the weak people.


Second, if we hate each other then we can't see each other fairly. We get prejudiced. Recently, I heard a lot sentences like “~~~ because he is a man” or “~~~ because she is a woman” in negative way. These are not good attitude when we see the person.

In conclusion, I want to change hatreds in our society to repect and understanding. Because hatreds have many negative effect such as crime and prejudiced."	2	2	1.5	5.5
2175	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I'd like to change our country's support about biomedical. In detail, I want to change treatment between doctor and researcher.
I have three reasons to support my opinion.
First, our country doesn't have doctor researcher.
Because, our country's treatment about doctor is even better than science or engineering researcher. This makes situation about lack of doctor researchers. They don't need to be a researcher because when they be a doctor they earn more money and honor. It's very serious problem. It shows that we can't speedly research or make treatment and vaccine about COVID-19. It's different from American enterprise. They have many doctor reserchers. But, our doctors don't know about COVID-19 or vaccine very well while they treat only other patients.

Second, this area is very developable point.
When our country change support about medical engineering, our country's financial situation is more better than now. Because other rich countries support a lot to biomedical area. So we need to follow this trend, moreover we need to lead this trend. To come true, our country need to change support attitude about biomedical area. 

Finally, we can defend or treat well about new virus.
If we support about this area more, then we can defend or treat easilly and efficiently about new virus. I think new virus will be back more stronger than COVID-19. So, we need to prepare thest virus. First of all, I want to suggest to our country that we need to more support about biomedical area.

We need to make more doctor researchers, develop more about this biomedical area and lead this trend. And this makes to prepare some other disease and virus. So I emphasize to change our country's support about biomedical and treatment between doctor and researchers.  "	2	2.5	2.5	7

I also felt this when i was high school student. so I want to change about study system in korea. first, they have to study about themselves. what I want to do, what i like, there are most important thing about student,  self education need  for them. if i could change education system, i make more time for self studing in education system in korea. and they have to know why they study hard,   "	2.5	2.5	2	7
2177	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"There are lots of things to develop in my country, but I think the most important thing to change is education.
  In Korea, every children go to elementery school, middle school, and those are their duties. The compulsory education is very good and systematic. However, when we consider the entrance examination like Korean SAT, the advantages of education system collapses, because the entrance exam is getting harder and public education can't fully help the students. That's why the private education is popular in Korea. For example, the Korean SAT is famous for its hard level, let me explain the reason. The students want to get good grade in this exam, so they get private education at 'hakwon.' So the mean of the grade increases. Then the examiners should make the exam harder. Therefore, the students should learn more and get private education more. It's a pretty bad cycle.
  There are few solutions to change the situation.
First, the evolution of Korean SAT. The Korean SAT is the most popular exam in Korea, so when we want to change the education, we should change the Korean SAT first. The exam consists of the short-answer question. There are limits to make the question to make students think, than using privately educated skills. Therefore, if the essay questions compose the exam, like Europe countries, this situation would be fixed.
Second, the change of public education. Like I mentioned, the public education can't fully help the students to take the entrance exam for now because of the private education, and increase of the students level. If the after school could replace the private education, the 'hakwon' might do not need anymore.
  The evolution of the entrance exam and the public education might be the way to change the Korean education, which is the private education is getting more popular. I wish the Korean education system goes to better way. Then, the society system would get better than now, too."	1.5	1.5	2	5
2178	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"What I want to change  is just the mindset of  our people. Nowadays, humans are weaker and weaker to deal with some threats like  idealogical racism, sexual conflict, and so on.  Someone may say that it is not our fault, but we can fell the  scary of  that. We don't have to check the responsibility  because of that reason: In fact, this specis that conquors and rules all around the world for their favor, and  has greed to take more and more without any anxiety of our habitats we live or neighbourhoods  we bother can't be responsibility of any problem. It could sound like a pessimist's assert if you  don't remember too many incidents like 2 times of Great War, 9.11 terror, and citizen's non-intellectual vote about 'Oppsite for Oposite'. I think it depends on the lack of confidence of human beings, which is specially excessive to korean. The more you are feel alone and have pessimism, the more your behavior and thought are radical.

2179	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"There can't be perfect country in the world, but there is a kind of ideal image. Therefore, we have to try hard to be close to that idol. There can be many way to be a better country, but it is obvious that fixing the overall educational process is the best way. There are two reasons about this.

Fisrtly, the most serious problem of current Korea is low number of babies, and the educational process' innovation can easily get rid of that. People in Korea don't want to make babies because of high cost for babies. There are many kinds of cost for babies, but the largest rate of the cost is for education. Parents must put their children to academy to get advance in competitions, and it makes parents pay lots of money. Therefore, if we decrease the competition between students by innovation of educational process, then dependence to academy must be lower, so parents don't have to pay lots of money like before. This will let people make more babies, then Korea can overcome the crisis of population structure. 

Secondly, the prior education is not efficient. Current Korean students must learn about stuff that is not related to their future job. Students are wasting time and money to learn useless thing, and it is causing serious unefficiency of society. Therefore, if we let student learn about things that is related to their future job, then the society can be much more healthier.

Some can think that Korea have to change some other things to become better country. However, for these reasons, fixing the overall educational process of Korea can make Korea be close to ideal country. "	2	1.5	2	5.5

so, if i could change on important thing about my country, i will choose that above.
first, i have ever seen the traffic jam which makes the car clash. because of that, bus, cars, and other transportation is stopped on the road about 10 minutes. and the people who are in the crosswalk also very dangeorous.
after that, i could see a news that relevant to the car clash. that was caused by interval of road. as  the interval is very shorter than other country, there are many accident.
so, if i can change the things about accident, first of all, i would like to make the interval of road wider if the place magnitude is possible. 
i can think the solution that if buildings is built, the interval of buildings should be short as possible. and then , the road can be made wider.
if the problem is considered, i think that the traffic jam is gonna be low. 
therefore, if we want to be safe for out family, friends from the taffic jam that causes accident, we should check the interval of road for making more safe and nice city."	3	3	2.5	8.5

"Since I was in highschool, I have thought about the topic many times. I started recognizing that there are many problems in my country at that time. Among the problems in my head, the worst is division between male and female. If I can change one thing, I want to solve polarization between them. In my opinion, it is useless in every way.
First, division between gender causes many society conflict. In fact, a lot of gender problems occured for several years. These made gender conflict harder, and the amount of people who argued with the topic increase. However, there are not any proper logic in their fighting. They just divide male and female into two teams. 
Second, gender conflict interrupt the development of our country. Any conflict can stop cooperation, so we can't proceed for our goals. In addition, some of people make the other gender enemy. It can make the quantity of marriage decrease.
I know there are many gender discrimination. But it is not correct that one-side should be responsible about the discrimination. We can solve those with considering differences between male and female."	2.5	2	2	6.5

Some say that University is not that important but many people rank the university and say about top ten university as a ""In Seoul University""which is often used in libral domain. Now I want to talk about why student want to get in the ""In Seoul University"". I think that seoul has better environment then other places. Korea is Seoul-centered-nation, so it must be changed.
  First, Seoul-centered-statement is getting harder and harder. As I mentioned before, people tend to want to live and work on the better place than other place. This state is remain if not take action and become harder.
  Second, we can't use the advantages in non-Seoul region when all the resources concentrated on Seoul. There are many advantages on non-Seoul area such as nice land scape and natural resources, historical places and et cetra . However, it is hard to use these positive points when all the people and money do not supply on these places. 
  Korea are going to Seoul-nation when ingore Seoul-centered situation and it is disadvantage to not be able to use many benefit on other district. For these reason, Korea should support non-Seoul region to escape Seoul-centered statement."	2.5	2.5	2	7

Second, we can communicate well in online system. In youtube comments or replys, we can see most of the words are bad and stressing others. These situation occurs the lack of basical meaning of communication. However, when people's ego changes to think about eachother, we can feedback each opinion and share our thoughts.
I want Korean ego to be smoothly for previous two reason. In fact, the second reason is not that important than first one. I've seen many people including my close friends who hurts by surrounding.

But if I have a chance to change only one thing about my country, I want to change an education system. There are several reasons to this opinion.

First, many students of Korea do not have their own dream. They have only one object, University. They only concentrate to university so they can't care about hobby, dream, various experience and etc. So if they enter the University they want, they don't know what to do!
Second, students feel so many stress to study and education. To many students, education and studying of my country are not their choice. It becomes almost mandatory so they can't feel the happiness and excitement of learning new things.

I am watching some serious situations going around all over the world, and the most important thing I have in mind is the warfare. Several countries continuing war in the 21 century, the age who never passed through war gave a huge impact for everyone, including me. From the news from Russia and Ukraine, reminds me that South Korea has not yet escaped entirly from the terror of the war. And this is the one I wish I could change from my country. To end the war permenantly, and freeing the painful history for our new future.
Starting a war and winning always gave some countries wealth and development in history. But in 21th century, the meaning and potential cost of war became unmeasurable. The destructive weapons made massive, or possibly, global destruction possible, and quick inform connection around the world created the blaming and horror to reach everywhere, anytime. the meaning of warfare has evolutionized through time.  War is not just a problem solver like past anymore. This is the reason I would change the state that we, South Korea is still going through the war.  I am pretty sure lots of people will agree with me anyone who encounters this question. War is the most confusing problem in this state, because we are watching a war from other countries. Not like before, the war zone is now visible through the internet, we can emphathize it better. Anyone who watches the terror of the war will never want to think about it, just like I did.
Ending the war in Korea will solve lots of problems in our country at once. It will solve a part of economic issues, nearby country relationship problems, and so on. This is another reason I wish of ending war, expecting various things intead of only one"	2.5	2.5	2	7

However, I have some dissatisfation about education, so I want to change some education policies of country.
 First of all, I want to develop the chances of experiencing many jobs in middle schools. Some people think that this policy has already existed but I think this progress is not really perfect. At the age of 14-16, many students don't know what they want to be, and what the jobs are exactly (what they do). So, I think that we have to focus not only grades or tests but also experiences to know jobs which they hope to become later.
 Second, I want to add a 'mandatory' swimming class. Though some schools have already done this courses, other schools do not include this course on students' class. I think knowing how to swim is the essential process and it will prevent students from dangerous situations.
 In conclusion, if I have a chance to change one important thing about my country, I hope to change educations of experiencing jobs and adding a mandatory swimming class."	2.5	2.5	2	7
2187	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I want to change the location of universities.
There are 3 reasons why I argue this.
First, there are too many people in Seoul. In Seoul, there are already many people on the small town. It causes traffic jam, waiting for the restaurants, lots of stress, and getting tired. Moreover, there are many universities in Seoul, so it causes more people living in Seoul. So, lots of social problems are getting worse.
Secound, In rural town, It is hard to meet others. For example, in KAIST, we can just meet KAIST students and Chungnam National University students. Other universities in Daejeon is so far so we can't meet them easy. But in Seoul, for example, Yeonsei University, which is located in Shinchon, there are many universities near it, so they can meet many people with easy. Besides, there are many metro which is transportation that go through underground. So it is easier to meet others than rural town.
Third, it is getting worse to set levels of universities. This means, for highschool students, there is word ""In Seoul"" which means universities in Seoul are  the best universities, and others are not. So they want to go universities in Seoul first. In fact, there is no different things between universities in Seoul and universities in rural town. Because both of them have high quality of lecture, and high quality of buildings, and high quality of facilites. Only location is different thing. So setting levels of universities is getting worse.
So, if I get a strength to change only one thing in Korea, I want to change the location of universities not in Seoul, but in rural town."	3	3	2.5	8.5

First,  As we know, our country doesn't have many resources. So we have to import resources from another country such as mideastern coutnries. Although we adapt our environment and develop many technics that transform pure resources to useful thing, I think if we have pure resources that can be found in our ground we can save money that is needed to buy pure resources.
Second,  with our technology, we can manufacture  goods ourselves. From pure resource to perfect goods, we can do all parts  just in our  country. And it will lead our country to export-strong country. 
Last,  we would not have to be influenced by other country's condition. For example, many fules are  concentrated to few countries and the price of  resources can be changed unexpectedly according to the countries. If we have enough resources, we don't have to face unexpected situation and it will make our economy stable.
 For these reasons, I want our country to have enough resources."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

"  My university has many advantages, but I want to change one important thing. These days, students take online classes by zoom, which is people use to have online classes. After COVID 19, students will have to take face-to-face classes in buidings. I want to change this system. I am in favor of taking classes by zoom after COVID 19 for these three reasons.
 FIrst of all, students can reduce time. In my opinion, today I got up early and walked 20 minutes to take a class in the morning. If it is not face-to-face class, I can sleep more time or do something. And after class, I walked 20 minutes to back to my dormitory. I have to spend time to take face-to-face classess, whereas I can study more things such as reading lecture notes or doing my homework.  Spending time to go is not efficient. 
   Second, students can reduce expenses. Some students buy bikes or lend something to ride, but they do not need if they can take classes by zoom. Buying bikes and automobiles are expensive for students. In addition, if they lend bikes or something to ride, they have to spend much expense.  
  Third, students feel free to spend time when they do not have class. Although there is just one class in a week, students tend to stay in dormitories because of transportation expenses. On the other hand,  if students can take classes by zoom, they can go home or trip when they don't have class. 
   In my opinion, students do not have to take face-to-face classes. It is true that there are some advantages when students take face-to-face classes, but it should be noted that students can save their time and reduce expenses by using zoom. So I think taking classes on the internet is better than offline classes.   "	5	4.5	4.5	14

A few days ago, I read a writing that a international student uploaded to Everytime, a communication site of KAIST students. He regret to enter KAIST.  Because it is hard to live at KAIST if international students don't know Korean. 
    In order to solve this problem, I want to change 2 detailed tings. First, I want many people use English more in the communication sites such as Everytime, Otl. Most of students share informations by using only Korean in the communication sites. So, it is hard to get informations for international students. Secondly, I want to open festival that both international students and Korean students take participated in. For example, food festival that was held a few weeks ago at KAIST.

2191	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Change KAIST location to Seoul
    In KAIST, there are some features that make students' life uncomfortable. For example, many students have hard time while they take lecture in English, and some students says that there is no delicious school cafeteria in KAIST. Also, The university is quite big and the there is no inner circle shuttle bus at night, it is very hard for students to go outside at night. Moreover, there is the most uncomfortable feature of KAIST; the location. If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I would change the location of KAIST from Daejeon to Seoul.
    First of all, the transportation system of Seoul is much better than that of Daejeon. The transportation system make the life boundary of the citizens. The transportation system of Daejeon is very rough, there are a lot of places that I can not go or takes too much time to go. That means, the boundary that I can go is small in Daejeon. For example, I should get a part time job near in dormitory. With bigger life boundary, the students can make a bigger picture of life. 
    Second, there are more opportunities to experience various things. The Seoul is the biggest city in Korea, many facilities, companies, and contents are concentrated in Seoul. The students can do various experience about their job like internship program, or enjoy their free time consuming various contents in Seoul. 
    Finally, the chance to communicate with other university students is much bigger if KAIST is in Seoul. Every best universities in Korea is located in Seoul except KAIST, the best students in Korea are in Seoul. People can get a big impression while communicating and cooperating with others. Also, the better the partner is, the better experiences are made. The chance of cooperating with best university students is given only the students live in Seoul. So, to give chance KAIST students to cooperate with other best students, the place of KAIST should be changed into Seoul.  
    In conclusion, I think the place of KAIST should be changed into Seoul since the transportation system of Daejeon is bad, many various opportunities to experience is given in Seoul, and cooperations with other university students becomes more easy in Seoul. When a person become a university student, many duties and freedoms are given to him or her. "	4	4.5	4	12.5

It has many problems that must be changed. I have two reasons why I want to change and solve this problem.
First of all, the comfortability of our home is the critical component for our life. Although we live 2 or 3 people in our room, our present dormitory's size is absolutely small. We could not do anything except studying, sleeping, and talking in our room. We have to go gym to do home training. Likewise, we have to delivery the food or go to restaurant every time. We can not cook anything in our dormitory. These limits of our room make us uncomfortable. And it can decrease our satisfying about university. If we live in large room, the quality of our life will be enhanced.
Secondly, the location of dormitory is the important thing to determine our activity range. The KAIST dormitories are located in the end line of KAIST. It makes us go outside rarely and be lazy. We have a lot of energy to go library, restaurant, study room, and cafe.  If I can change the location of dormitory, I will move them to more inside of KAIST. 
This examples make my opinion more reasonable. Based on the above reasons, I think if I can change one important thing about KAIST, I will change our dormitory to enhance satisfying of our life."	5	4.5	4.5	14

If I can change my only one thing, I will change my life pattern like it for the folowing reasons.
   First, if I can wake up early in the mornig, I can eat breakfast. Beause I wake up late, I cannot eat breakfast, and I have no choice but to go to class hungry. Getting up early solves this problem.
   Second, I can do morning exercise. In the morning, I am still tired, but I can start my day refreshing by exercise. In addition, if I exercise early in the morning, I can exercise again at night.
   Third, I can save my money. If I stay up late at night, I have to relay on delivery because university restaurants are close. Delivery food is quite expensive, so I can save my money just by not eating it.
   Lastly, I can see the sunlight much more. When I sleep alte at night and wake up late in the afternoon, I can see the sunlight only in a short time of the day. More sunlight makes I feel better and healthier.

2194	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"One important thing that I want to change in KAIST
  With COVID-19, we can't attend class in offline. Online classes make diverse troubles not expected and feel boring. To solve students' complaint, KAIST made S/U system which is grading with pass or fail. However now, by almost disappearing COVID-19, S/U system is also disappearing, too. If I could change one important thing about my university, KAIST, I would change S/U system remaining about basic needed subjects. 

  First, It makes new students who are entering in KAIST in this year, feel free. When I entered KAIST first, I dreamed going travel, eating delicious foods, drinking lots of drinks, having a beautiful girl friend. However, in KAIST, I had no time to do that because of lots of assignments and class. The class in KAIST is famous as hard to understand and lots of assignments. To get good grades, there are no time to rest. Although I entered in KAIST in 2021, but l had troubles with doing them.

  Second, It makes new students think they can adapt in KAIST well. In KAIST, almost classes teaches with English. Students who haven't done classes with English may forgive studying. Both understanding classes and getting good grades are very hard for them. However, with S/U system, they will not forgive their studies at first. 

  Grading all classes with S/U systems could makes some problems but I could tell that it haves more advantages about grading basic needed subjects. What do you think about? If you think so, why you agree?"	4	4.5	4	12.5
2195	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"The Thing that I Want to Change in KAIST

  As you know, KAIST is a great university. Good students, good professors are in KAIST, and lots of systems help students learning and studying. However, some systems are uncomfortable for students. Especially, I do not satisfy with the cafeteria system of KAIST. While I live in dormitory, it was really hard to eat good foods. Hence, I want to change food and cafeteria system of KAIST.
  First of all, the quality of foods is bad. I understand that it is hard to make foods with great quality due to lots of students and price. However, foods tastes bad considering that condition. One of my friends said, ""I do not visit cafeterias in KAIST because foods are not delicious."" I agree with him and I think restaurants in KAIST should improve their foods. Hence, I want KAIST to improve foods quality such as using better grading system for restaurants.
  Secondly, price of cafeteria foods are expensive. As university students do not have job yet, students can not spend lots of money for foods. Thus, lots of universities provide cheap cafeteria foods for students. However, the price of foods in KAIST is increasing now. As there are no replacements of cafeteria in KAIST, students have to pay high price to eat foods. So, I want to lower price of foods in KAIST restaurants.
  The last reason is that delivery system is bad. As KAIST campus is far from the center of the city, delivery takes lots of time. Sometimes we should wait for 1 hour to get delivery foods. Also, high price is a huge matter. Due to the distance, KAIST students have to pay high delivery tip when they use delivery systems. Because of long waiting time and high price, students can not easily use delivery systems. Students would eat better foods if there were convenient delivery systems for KAIST students. Therefore, I want to change food delivery system if I could.
  To sum up, I want to change food system of KAIST because of bad quality, high price, and bad delivery system. Eating is very important. Great eating improves students life. It would give better outputs to KAIST. For both KAIST and students, I want to improve foods and restaurants in KAIST. I hope KAIST improve foods someday."	4.5	4.5	4	13
2196	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Various field of study
I think KAIST is a top university in Korea. It is famous for natural sciences and engineering. Comparing with other universities, KAIST's majors are all about science. University can only focus on science and invest on it. It's true that students can study science in depth but, not for other fields of studies. Studying various field is also important. There are liberal arts classes, but it's lack than other universities. I want to enhance more.
First, students can get common sense it many field. What we study on liberal arts is not that deep content. Even though it's basic knowledge, students use it through life. A little learning is much better than complete ignorance.
Second, students can broaden their perspective. At KAIST, we only meet friends who are interested in science. This might affect to students to have narrow angle. We can't meet people who are interested in music, language extra. Liberal arts classes can give an indirect experience. 
Third, it's helpful for science study. There are many fusion fields. For example, psychology and brain science. Students can get knowledge from other field and graft on their study in future.
For these reasons, liberal art classes are necessary  to student. There are some liberal arts classes, but it's lack than other universities. I want to enhance liberal art classes at my university. "	5	4.5	4.5	14

   The most important thing that I would change is study abroad programs. I will activate it more and I want to include more student in. Although it may not be the best choice for my university, I am in favor of changing it for three reasons.
   First of all, students can become more mature through studying abroad. Living in a strange place away from familiar places improves independence. You can grow and develop internally through adapting alone in an unfamiliar place and learning a new culture. My school professor said during the lecture, ""The more people live alone and independently, the stronger they become internally.""
   Second, you can experience many people's experiences while encountering education in various countries. Through this learning, it will develop itself and help our school develop. Similarily, Korea's education methods and examination systems have been accepted from countries that are more advanced than ours. This greatly developed our nation's education system.
   Finally, you can make global connections by studying abroad. By studying abroad, you can make friends with students from various countries as well as foreign students. This has many positive effects even after graduation, and it is a very meaningful experience.
   To summarize, students can become more mature, have many experiences, and make international connections by studying abroad. For these reasons, if I could only change one thing, I would change study abroad programs. I will not only activate studying abroad and increase the number of people, but also make it more advanced.

2198	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Mentor Program In Our University
     I wish that our university has mentor program. Mentor program is that all students have their mentor in their university. In fact, in Korea University has mentor program and I heard about this from my friends who are students of Korea University. They say it is very good program, and I also think this program is good for students.

     First reason is students can make friends in this program. If you have a mentor, you can be friendly with your mentor. In additional, you can meet your mentor's friends and become good friends. If you make many friends,  you can enjoy your university life with your friends. 

     Second reason is students can get information about our university, their major and some tip for student who is freshman.  Many students do not have information about those. If they have mentor, they can know some information. Therefore, they can enjoy university life more easily.

     Finally, mentors can also grow up with their student. They also can make friend with student and student's friends. They study some information about that they do not know about that in order to give this information to their student. Therefore, mentors also 
can gain something, so it is good for mentors and their student.

     In conclusion, I think this program is very good. Therefore, if our university has this program, students can be more happy and friendly and more love our university. Then, I hope that our university has mentor program."	5	5	4.5	14.5
2199	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  As prices increase, most restaurants in KAIST increase their food cost. But, as we know, student funds increased only 10,000 won when we compared it with 2000s. I think that KAIST should increase student funds to 200,000 won at least for two reasons.
  The first reason is to keep students' life. I do not get some money from my parents, so I earn some money by school work. I can earn about 330,000 won by school work and get 145,000 won by student funds. If I did not do other small works outside, I have to live a month in 475,000 won which is less than 500,000 won. When I pay for dormitory and telephone, it is very hard to live with that money. I think there should be other students who are in the same condition in KAIST.
  The second reason is high average food cost of KAIST restaurants. As I heard from my friends, most universities maintain their average food cost under 4,000 won. But, I think average food cost of KAIST is about 6,000 won which is quite expensive. Even students eat only in school, they need about 400,000 won. It is hard for many students to pay about 400,000 won for food in a month.
  By inflation, prices increase fastly. In this condition, KAIST should consider about increasing student funds for students to study without any money concern."	4.5	4.5	4	13

    How do you think about the most important thing about the university? I think the location of the university is one of very important thing. If I could change one important thing about Kaist, I would change the location of Kaist to Seoul. There are three reasons why I choose to change location. First of all, advantages of traffic. I live in Seoul now, so I could experience the traffic gap between Seoul and Daejeon. If I want to go somewhere in Daejeon, I always need to use taxi. Because it is hard to use buses or subway. However, I can use various traffics in Seoul. The traffic problems are very important in our university life, so I want to use Seoul's well developed traffics. Next, all of my friends live in Seoul. I live in Seoul since I went to the elementary school. So, all of my friends live in Seoul, and they go to the university which locates in Seoul. But I can't go Seoul often, because the Daejeon is so far to Seoul. Also, there are various types of people in Seoul, but I always meet Kaist's student in Daejeon. I think that playing with friends or meeting various types of people are important in the university life, so I want Kaist locate in Seoul. Finally, there are a few things to play in Daejeon. There are lots of things to play in Seoul, such as restaurants, cafe, university streets, etc. Daejeon also has these things, but they are not many. Seoul is the most well developed city in Korea, so there are lots of people and facilities. Because of these advantages, I would change Kaist's location Daejeon to Seoul. In conclusion, there are three reasons why I choose location to change. The traffics, all of my friends live in Seoul, and lot of people and well developed facilities are them. Thank you for reading my essay."	5	4.5	4	13.5
2201	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"One Important Thing that I Want to Change About My University

   KAIST is the best Engineering university in South Korea. Especially, many students who are graduated in science high-school or academy come KAIST. On the other hand, many students before choice of college  which we passed admission think carefully about 'this'. This is the location of  KAIST. I want to change location of KAIST from Daejeon to Seoul because of various people, experiences, and individual happiness. 

   First, we can face various people in Seoul. KAIST is in Daejeon. Not only Seoul but also Daejeon is big city. However, there are not many university in Daejeon. Seoul has huge population and there are a number of university. KAIST has great engineering and science education system, but we don't have many opportunities to face other people who study humanities or arts. Nowadays, engineers must communicate with others and need not only engineering but also humanities. Therefore, I want to change KAIST's location to Seoul to face various people to improve our abilities.

Second, we can experience in various aspect in Seoul. Although student can experience something in Daejeon , but Seoul has huge and many systems that we can experience in various aspect than Daejeon. I think that having many experience when we are young is more important than just study engineering. In Seoul, we can experience many things in high qualities and easily. For example, there are so many musicals and concerts near universities in Seoul. I want to join, but it is hard to go Seoul often. Also, it is tough to watch musical or concerts in Daejeon.

Third, more students can enjoy their own life happy. KAIST has more men than women. So, there are many boys who want to have girlfriend or go meeting. Meeting is party that many college students go who want to play with others or make girl, boyfriend. But also there are not many university and meetings in Daejeon, not only there are not many participation to make party. It is hard to make love or friends. That makes KAIST students hard to experience about meeting or party. I think that's why KAIST students feels hard to enjoy their college life in Daejeon. 

In conclusion, I want to make KAIST students have a lot of experiences, facing many people, and  more happiness in college life by changing location. If we can change KAIST's location, KAIST will be best university that have perfect students. Thank you.  "	4.5	4.5	4	13
2202	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"What I want to change most in my university, the chance of meeting many people
   After graduating the high school, most of students in Korea go to university to improve their abilities. Therefore, the mean of the university for them is as important as the high school, so there are lots of important things in university. I think it also takes me too. There are many important things in my university, but I also think some are weak compare to other universities. Among them, I strongly think the chance to meeting many people is poor than others. I want to change this, so I explain this for several reasons.
   First of all, the width of experience can be increasing. The experience of meeting many people means we can experience a lot of events. For example, when we enjoy the university festivals, not only our university's students come, but also many different kinds of people would join in. In addition to this example, there are lots of events that enable us to experience, but I think these are poor in our university.
  Secondly, we can meet the important people for our life by this. When students meet many different kinds of people, they can also meet some people who are perfectly suitable for them. For instance, when they are preparing a project with other university students, they can be good friends by working together. I also think this oppertunity is not enough than other universities.
  Lastly, students can enjoy their life of being university students. By meeting many other people, they can solve their stress, talk about their problems and playing games. There are lots of tired things to univerisity students, but they can relieve it by playing lots of things with others. Therefore, it is also a good point of when the chance of meeting many people is enough.
  Like this, there are lots of positive points when univerisity students meet many other people , but I think it is not enough to my university. Therefore, I want my university change it sequently."	4.5	4.5	4	13
2203	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST Should Build More Club Rooms
  I think during attending college period, students have to do not only study hard their major, make lots of experiences and good memories too. In that point of view, one of the most important activity that can do at university is club activity, because students usually build a community in their and almost all good memories are came from there. To reach that purpose more well, one thing that KAIST should do is to build more number of club rooms for following two reasons.
  First, existence of the own club room enlarge the club's activity. I know that there are many clubs that does not have their own club room or share their room with other club. In that situation, those clubs have to find some places that their main activity that frequently be done, because they do not have club room for that in school or always have to make a deal with other club sharing their club room. This hardness of finding proper place forbid coming out of new clubs and acting club activities.
  Second, own club room is essential for building friendship in the club. In my experience, I joined two clubs that one has their own room and the other has not.  At the club has their own room, it was so easy to make a friends in their, because whenever I go to the room, there is at least one member who just playing at there. So, every club members go there when they have a free time, and there is not much time needed for all members know each other. On the other hand, other club I joined has a sharing club room. Therefore, we must careful for interrupting other clubs activities, while only three days a weak are given to our club. It is obvious that we spend much more time and money to meat each other at other place more frequently. 
  In conclusion, without own club room, the club is too hard for making friendship within members and active more frequently and fun based on that friendship. I know that KAIST have been spending much money to build freshmen community through a few programs such as Fun College Life class. At this time, I think that activate the club activity is more efficient way. Therefore, If there is one thing that be changed at KAIST, that is building more club rooms."	4.5	4	4	12.5
2204	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"The one thing that I want to change about KAIST

    I love my university KAIST. I'm so interested in mathmatics and science, and KAIST is one of the best place to learn the professional knowledge about these subjects. Also, in KAIST, I can do some personal research that I want, and KAIST helps me to get board vision and sight about my future job. I satisfy at facilities and infrastructure of KAIST too. Actually, there is not so much things I want to change, because I already satisfy for almost things of the KAIST. But, there is one thing that I want to change. I want some more restaurant in KAIST. There are two reason why I think like that.
    First is the number of restaurants. As you know, KAIST campus is very big. So, if you want to eat lunch after class, in almost case you might go to the restaurant near the class because other resataurant is too far to go. But there are few choices, so your lunch menu will be almost same every week. In my case, I always eat lunch near the E3, so my lunch menu is fixed to subway, or halal food. Fortunately I love subway, but it is fact that the number of restaurant is not enough.
    Second is a quality of food. Honestly, I think quality of food is not good, especially food of cafeteria. There are lots of menu in cafeteria, but I eat just one menu. Except this one menu, I think all food in cafeteria has poor quality for the price. Lots of student agree with this. There are lots os discontent from students who use cafeteria usually. 
    To sum up, KAIST don't have enough restaurant, also some restaurant has poor food quality. Meal huge affects to the quality of life, so I think this is very important thing. So, if I can change one thing about KAIST, I will build more resaturants, and also I will improve the quality of the food."	4.5	4.5	4	13
2205	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" If I have a chance to change one thing in my university, I will change online classes to offline classes. Al though online classes will disappear later, I want to join in classes on-site. I think many students disagree with this statement because online classes are easy and comfortable to join it. However, I think online classes do not have other advantages. So, I am going to talk about the reasons why offline classes are better. 
 First, offline classes can make students participate in the class. Think about classes that you have listened to. Do you have some experiences you just stay mute when you are in activity zoom classes? I have also had similar experiences. However, in offline class, I participated in the class more actively. It was because  I must talk to others face-to-face, so I can easily open my mouth.
  Second, we can concentrate in class. In online classes, there are many classes in which we don't have to turn on cameras. Then, we are able to do other things like cell phones or games. However, there are many limits to do in offline classes. In summary, what I want to say is the surroundings of online classes make hard to concentrate in the class.
Finally, we can make friends more directly. I have seen many students who did not have a chance to make friends, especially students who entered school in 2020.  So, in offline classes, we are able to have classes with students who will be your friends. 
I really hope to join in classes in online due to these reasons. It would be better you see this arguments in effectiveness of learning and society, not in comfort or freedom. Then, you must change your opinion. So, if I have an ability to change something in KAIST, I want to transform forms of classes. "	5	4.5	4	13.5
2206	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  Bus is good traffic method. But there are little bus station in my university. I think we need more bus station and being short between each bus time in university.   
  The first reason is that subway station is too far from university. Subway is another great traffic method that people usually use. But, the nearest subway station, Weolpyeong station is too far from my university. It takes more than 40 minutes by walking. It's very long time to office people and university student. To use subway more easier, we need more bus to go subway station. If there are more bus than now and being short between each bus time, then we can use less time that we use for moving. 
  The second reason is that there are no restaurant near from school. Of course, there are some restaurant in school, but students did't go to school restaurant sometimes. So, I will talk except school restaurant. Especially, when lunch time or dinner time become nearly, there are no taxi in school. There are no restaurant that are near from university. It takes more than 20 minutes by walking. More bus and short between bus time can make that students eat lunch and dinner outside from university in short time.  
  Bus is cheaper than other traffic method is the last reason. Bus is useful for university students who are not easy to earn money. Another traffic method such as taxi is too expensive to move far. For example, if I have only two thousands won and I should go to other position that is far from my university. Then, I can't use any other traffic method except bus. So, bus is best traffic method for university students. So, students need more bus station and being short between each bus time for easier to use bus. 
  In conclusion, there are three reasons why students need more bus station and being short between each bus time in university. Those were distance to substation from university, no restaurant near from school and cheaper than other traffic method. For busy university student, university try to make more bus station in university and become short between each bus time"	5	4.5	4	13.5
2207	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Not Only Academics
          Universities are the place where students grow up both academically and as human beings. Most of the universities in the world are obsessed with the academics part for obvious reasons but they are not raising the students as persons and preparing them for the challenging life after college. I believe KAIST is one of them even though they try really hard to fix it in the last few years. I would like to lose the pressure on students to be successful academically. So what are the options to solve this issue?
          Firstly,  I would not set a minimum GPA to keep the scholarship of the students. There are hundreds of students from different social backgrounds. Setting a minimum GPA for the scholarship will make them more anxious and cause them to miss having fun with their friends. This will make those students more anxious because they will not be able to relax and they will not have strong bonds with other peers. In the end, they will most likely be alone and trying to achieve a higher GPA but will not be prepared how to form a friendship after college.
          Secondly, good colleges have a rigorous curriculum and KAIST is one of them. I think most of us chose KAIST due to this reason. But I believe having a rigorous curriculum requires a good relaxation day at least once a week. For instance, at Harvard, students work and study really hard and do parties every Friday. This helps them to start the new week fresh and also reminds them that life is not only about studying or working really hard but also about spending time for your needs.
          Thirdly,  offering specific classes such as self-finance,  first aid, communication, hand-crafting, and music classes and asking students to try these courses. It should not be mandatory but asking peers to pick some of them would help students to communicate and support each other more at difficult times. Peer review and support are critical for students who do not have their families next to them. This will help students to socialize, and teach them important rules about human relationships and how the actual world is.
          To sum up, I believe colleges like KAIST should focus on raising students as educated people not only in academics but in human interactions as well such as being prepared to make their budget, play an instrument, or how to help someone in an emergency. These essential skills will be used by students for the rest of their life and help peers to be more successful in academics as well."	4.5	4.5	4	13
2208	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST is an university with a dormitory. Many students stay here, during the semester. Especially, it is mandatory for first-year students to stay at school dormitory. Since we can't cook in our rooms, we usually go out or order food by delivery to have meals. Because university students can not earn much, students prefer school cafeteria. But school meals are receiving negative feedback, so I would like to change school meals.
    First, KAIST meals are more expensive than other universities. They're cheaper than restaurants, but students feel pressure to have three meals a day at the cafeteria. In comparison, in SNU there are meals that only costs 1000 won. As KAIST meal is expensive, food is a lot, so I often leave food behind, which is inefficient.
    Secondly, the quality of food is decreasing. There aren't any competitive corners in cafeteria, so they do not try to enhance the quality and lower the price. Therefore students are looking for instant foods, that is cheap and guaranteed to be tasty. I experienced KAIST meals 2 years ago, and I feel the sharp drop of the quality.
    Finally, diversity of meals are also needed. When we look through student communities, students want new corners in school to try other kinds of food. There are some corners, but it would be better if we add more.
    To sum up, KAIST meals are expensive than its quality and efficiency. To make meals better, I think the university should add more food corners for competition, encourage them to enhance the quality of food. If these changes happen, I am sure that not only students will love to visit school cafeteria, but also the sales of food corners might increase. Expecting these positive effects, I would like to change KAIST's school meals."	4	4.5	4.5	13

"    If I could change one important thing about my university, I would change the portal system of KAIST. There are some reasons why I would like to change the portal system of KAIST.
    First, the website has too much information. When we enter the portal website there is information such as newsletter, scholarships, and events held in KAIST. The information may be important but there are so many things on the website that we can not find the information that we need.  
    Second, the server is not stable. Since the portal system is one of the main websites in KAIST, many users use the website at the same time. But, the server state is bad and because of this, there is a lot of loading. There should be some maintenance updates for the server to maintain the requests made by the users.
    Third, the design of the website is not easy to use. There are lots of menu buttons on the website and most of the users do not use all the menu buttons. Since there are lots of buttons, users can not find the menu they need and spent lots of time searching information they want. So, it is not convenient for most users to use the website. 
    The portal system is one of the important websites in the university. By improving the portal system, many students can find the information they need easier and have better school life.

2210	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Changing cafeteria of KAIST
Studying is most important part of universities. To make students work hard, giving them high quality food is necessary. However, in KAIST, I do not think there are enough cafeteria and restaurant for students. I firmly believe that cafeteria of KAIST need change for the following three reasons.
First, The size of the cafeteria is too small. Of course, our university has less students than other university, but the size of restaurant for students on campus is much smaller than other universities. For example, in North part of campus, there is cafeteria named  'KAIMARU'. However, the cafeteria is so small that a lot of students cannot eat lunch or dinner even they want to eat there. Also, last week, my friends and I went to the 'Subway', but there didn't have any seats for us. So we just have to get out of the restaurant. Therefore, KAIST need to expand the size of the cafeteria for students. 
Second, The price of food is very expensive. Since students cannot go out of campus, students eat meals in cafeteria even though the price is very high. For example, The kimbap in KAIMARU is 2,500 won, but it has very low quality. Also, cafeteria at the West part of campus, the price is so high that some students mad about it. However, other universities, the food of cafeteria is very cheap for students. For instance, Seoul National university, there is a meal that only price 2,000 won. Because students do not have a lot of money, KAIST needs to change prices of food lower. 
Lastly, The quality of food is very low. In March, I went to Lotteria in campus and ordered one bugger and one fries. But I get that food 30 minutes later. Also, the quality of food was awful. The bread of bugger was very cold to eat, so I trashed it. Not only me, there are a lot of complain of Lotteria. Furthermore, food in KAIMARU is low-quality than its prices. It does not taste good, but students need to go there because there is not any other restaurant.    
To sum up, I want to change school's cafeteria and restaurant if I can change one important thing of KAIST. The size of cafeteria and restaurant is too small, and the price of food is very expensive. Also, the food has very low quality. If I can change cafeteria of KAIST, I will make it much larger and low its prices. I hope cafeteria of KAIST change and a lot of students could enjoy delicious meals."	5	5	4.5	14.5

Most common way is working for 18~21months as a soldier. There are many classes in military but only soldiers are not getting the minimum wage. Soldiers are always staying in military except vacation different from other classes. We work for 8 hours per day and do border work alternately for 24 hours everyday. But our wage is only 1/3 of minimum wage. Everyone knows that military service is a duty and I think we have to do military service because South Korea still has threat from North Korea.

But I think this wage is too low. So if I could change one thing about my country, I will change soldier's wage. Every korean man have to do military service as many other types. Most common way is working for 18~21months as a soldier. There are many classes in military but only soldiers are not getting the minimum wage. Soldiers are always staying in military except vacation different from other classes. We work for 8 hours per day and do border work alternately for 24 hours everyday. But our wage is only 1/3 of minimum wage. Everyone knows that military service is a duty and I think we have to do military service because South Korea still has threat from North Korea. But I think that if country needs people to protect country then country needs to pay enough to people who volunteer for country. So I think country needs to raise the wage of soldiers to at least minimum wage."	2.5	2.5	2	7
2213	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    If I can change one thing about my country, I want to change Education system. Many students spend their time in academy, not their school. When my father was student he didn't go academy, but now me and my friends go many academy when we were student. I think it is not good for students.
   FIrst, it is unfair for some students. If every student don't go academy, they can only learn in their school. But some people can go academy, only some people  take more class. Then they will be good at studying. Country have to provide same change for every student, but it is impossible because of too many academys. And choosing academy is not student's choice. It choosed by parents' economic power and information power.   As a result, student who is poor or doesn't have information about academy, they can't study well.  As a result, they study hard but other students who go to academy get good grade. 
   Second, Education system that many student go academy causes student getting harder and harder. Because if there are many academy, student has to go many academy, too. For example if my fridend started to go math academy and his math skills have improved, I will go math academy too. If this repeats, student has to go too much academy and they spend their most time in academy. When I was high school student, even though I lived in dormitory I went to go academy. So I  spent my time in dormitory on weekday and I spent my time in academy on weekend. And my  friend who didn't live in dormitory, took a class after school. So she spent her time in school on daytime and  she spent her time in academy on evening and night. Like this, too much academy causes student don't have their  free time.
 For these reason, I think we should reduce academy. If I can change one thing in my country, I will reduce academy and make more public education. "	2.5	2.5	2	7

 I want to make number of ""Doctor Helicopter"" increase. Doctor helicopter is a helicopter that not only rescue people who got hurt, but also doctors can do simple treatment for patients before arriving to hospital. Doctor helicopter is very helpful to save people. But to use helicopter, It is need that special space only for helicopter on rooftop of hospital. In additional, people live near by hospital don't want helicopter becasue of noise. And goverment don't want to take responsibility for doctor's life when doctor dies during rescue."	2.5	2.5	2	7
2215	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change one important thing about my contry, Korea, I would change the subway system. I would make all places of my country be connected with subway trains. There are three reasons: there are too many places that are not close to any subway stations, the subway system is the savior of the traffic jam, and reducing moving time saves a lot of time of people.

 First of all, there are too many places that are too far from subway stations. If you live in Seoul or Busan or Gyeongido in Korea, theire subway systems are well connected and there are many lines so that you can go anywhere riding subway. However, other parts of Korea including major cities like Daejeon, there are so many places that can not go only using their subways. This is why I think there should be more subway systems in many cities in Korea.

Second, the subway system can solve the traffic jam problem. Korean humanity density is very high, especially in major cities called Gwangyeoksi. This is why the roads in many cities are filled with cars during morning and evening, when their drivers go to their schools or companies. This makes the delay problem, it spend an hour during traffic jam to go the road which takes just 5 minutes! However, trains are not delayed even though there are many people in them. Just increasing the number of trains during rush hours, traffic jam will be dramatically decreased with the train system which makes people not drive their cars.

Finally, the shorter the time spend for moving, the happier people feel. If people drive their cars to go their companies or homes, they not only spend a lot of time in rush hour, but also should concentrate on their driving. This means that people should waste a lot of time just moving in their cars! If they do other things in their car, the car accident must occur, so they do not have any choices. However if they ride the subway, it takes the shorter time to arrive their destination and they can do other things during the moving times. I believe that makes a lot of save times.

For these reasons, I would build more subway stations and increase the number of subway trains. It spends a lot of money for doing it, but I believe increasing subway makes people life more efficient, and it can make good effect to my country."	1.5	1.5	2	5

If you could change on important thing about your country, what would you change? 
 In my case, I will delete disease. I have two reasons why I choosed that.
 First of all, The most of reasons why people dead is occured by disease. 
we are alive and want to run away from death. 
Maybe, deleting the dieases in our country is the best way to stop thinking about death.
Also, we can earn money to this choice. The other countries want to know how can we win with disease’s fight. 
We can get advertisement effect.
 Secondly, We can develop other studies without medical.
In Korea, Only students who get the best score in their school can go medical university and be the doctors.
But, If I delete disease, maybe the number of doctors are expotentially decrease.
So, that students have to go other studies such as science, math, law, language,etc.
 There are the reasons why I choosed deleting disease. 
I think erasing disease in my country, it can be great chance to develop all of our thing."	3	3.5	2.5	9

"Our education programs are frequently changed by the country. High school education has changed a lot this time, too.  But I think education programs shouldn't be changed often. So I want to change our education program strongly.
First, I will make physics as a mandatory subject for science and engineering students. Physics is one of the most important subject in science and engineering. But many students don't want to learn it because they think physics is too hard to study. So, I want to tell them physics is pretty fun.
Second, I will change English education to listening and speaking education. Our English education now focus on reading and writing. So students learn about grammar, very importantly. Grammar is important, too, but  I think it's much more important to be able to communicate. This part can be changed easily because everyone knows it already.
Finally, I want to eliminate the night-study of high school. Teenagers are the best age to make memories with friends. They are healthy, energetic, and smart. So in my opinion, teenagers should make good memories as much as they can.
Our education program does not seem to be effective as much as it does. However, the people of Korea are very smart. I believe that Korea will be able to develop far more.  Thank you."	2	1.5	2	5.5

In SNS, when famous people make mistakes, they get bad images more than they did. And then they participate tv programs, the bad images are much bigger. So they have to not participate any tv programs.
Then, Didn't you make any mistakes in your life? Actually not. Famous people also peole like you. They can't be perfect like you can't be perfect. Why they can't appologize and admit?

For me, I couldn't go outside and drink at night even though I got 20 years old this year. I'm very disappointed of that. So, I want to change my country's system against COVID-19, especially about restriction. 
First, lot of people are suffering from restriction issues. As people can't  go out and stay at night, lot of stores are damaged. They got less money and it caused many problems to lots of people. To rebalance the economic system, I think restriction should be reduced.
Second, many people lost their hobbies. For instance, I liked playing sports such as baskerball or soccor. However, COVID-19 and restriction stopped me playing sports so I lost my biggest hobby. It reduced my quality of life and also effected to my health. I found lot of similar examples from my friends. For lot of people who lost their joy, restricion should be altered.
Third, it is less effective. Inspite strong restriction for COVID-19, the people who get COVID-19 are increasing. I think that the effect of restriction is not that strong. I felt that side effects of restriction are larger than the positive effect. So I thought we should weaken the restriction.
I know that restrcition is necessary to overcome the COVID-19 situation. However, I think my country's restrcition is more than enough. Lot of side effects as I mentioned suffers citizens of my country. I really hope this pandemic situation end but I believe restriction is not good method now. So, I want to change my country's restriction system against COVID-19.

"In Korea, people think having good etiquette to older person is very important. It can seem that Koreans have good manner, but the society sometimes coercions it to young people. I think special treatment for age in Korea is too much. 
First, it makes psychological distatnce between young things and elders.  The idea that elders should be respected only because they lived longer than young things doesn't help them to act well to elders. This can make resistance and may not listen carefully elder's words. This will make young things and elders can't understand each other and make situation worse.
Second, there are some adults who think young people are under them is natual. It's true that they lived longer and may know well about life. However this doesn't mean  age is  status. People are all in horizontal relationship and can't ignore individual opinion. Having good manner to each other is necessary.  
For these reasons, I think Korea should not think age less important than before. "	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

   I would want to change our Confucian culture. Confucian culture is one of important tradition in Korea. Many of holidays, foods, plays are derived from Confucian culture. But I think there are lots of parts to be fixed and some traditions to be discarded. I want to talk about the drawbacks of Confucian culture in Korea.
  First, Confucian culture consists  sexual discriminations. It says that men are supposed to go out for work and lead the family, and women are supposed to stay in the house, cook, and care for baby. Although these things are disappearing these days, these thoughts still remain in Korean's mind and affects their lives. It affects holidays too.
For example, Chuseok and Seollal, women are very busy preparing foods. Cooking and preparing for ancestral rites  are mostly women's roles. I think these are really unfair and they are sexual discriminations.
  Second, it assists being authoritative. Young people must be polite to older people and in society, low level people should be polite to their superiors without reason. It is good to be polite to other people, but it has drawbacks too. Superiors can suppress people which have lower levels than them. 
  For these reasons, I strongly claim that Confucian culture must be fixed and should be changed.  We can progress much better without Confucian culture and be better society.Drawbacks of Confucian Culture

There are so many problem, but I think many people do many thing very fast. This behavior can make people fast and can finish their work. But, I think this behavior has some problem. I will tell you about this
 The reason is that if  we do many thing fast, we may make many mistake. For example, I write my homework very fast, then I have some mistake of spelling. And In order to take may working fast, I multitask them. Therefore, I miss part of them. So, we do something slowly because we make some misstake.
  As I tell you, I think people do fast is not good. Therefore I think Korean change that doing fast to doing slowly."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

The disabled don't come out because it's uncomfortable, then the other think that it is not important to change the surroundings. So, I want to make people know that there are many kinds of people by changing a textbook that just say about primitive example.
I think the biggest thing that have to change is a form of family. When we say family, people think about a family with mom, dad, kids, etc. We need to show various forms of family in contents like novels, essays or cartoons.
It should seem like small change, but I think that small change will make all people equal some day."	2.5	3	2.5	8

But, like my case, many people in Korea think simmilary with my opinion,  and I think that these phenomenons cause some problems in Korea. If I could change one important thing in Korea, I will change this phenomenon : Infras that only focus in Seoul, and people's biased prefer in Seoul. There are three reasons that I want to change this penomenon. First, this phenomenon can increase Seoul's houses prefer too much, and this can increase houses' price too much. I know that this phenomenon is not only resaons for increasing houses' price, but also this phenomenon is important part. Houses' price is very important part of people's life in Korea. And also its too much increase can cause lots of social problems like low fertility probelm.  Lots of people still want Seoul apartment. I think this is one of important reasons of problems of Korea nowdays. Next, people's biased interest in Seoul can only make Seoul better, and other cities are not. Seoul's infra of education, traffic, and work place is so much better than other cities. These make positive feedback : lots of people want Seoul's infra, and it makes more money get into Seoul's infra. In my opinion, we need to put money in other cities to have balanced development in Korea. Lastly,  in the view of future of Korea,  I think we need to have cities like Seoul more than three in Korea. Nowdays there are some big cities like Busan in Korea, but I think we still too focus on Seoul.  If we have lots of very developed cities, Korea can be more great country to live. In conclusion, I think one of the important problems of Korea is biased prefer and development of Seoul following for these three reasons. So if I could change one important thing in Korea, I want to change this phenomenon and get lots of advantages."	1.5	1.5	2	5
2225	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change one thing about my country. I want to change our country's location.  If our country's location was better than now, Korea can be better country in various aspect. Here's some reasons what I want to tell.

 First reason is high possibility of development.   
   Have you read the book named 'gun virus steel' ? I read that book when I was highschool student. That book talked about why Euroupe make industry revolution earier and there's no probability between racies and development. However, one of the causes about differences of development is a country's location. Korea has great weather to farm, but we have small ground to farm and there's a lot of mountains. That makes our country's development lower than other Europe countries. Therefore, if Korea located in somewhere better than here, possibility of being better country is higher.

 Second reason is low nature resources near Korean Peninsula.
   I think you have heard that our country has been completed by ""people"".  Though most of great countries have great people and great technologies those are helpful to countries, however South Korea is the one of the best country in this aspect. South Korean's mind or love for country could be one reasons about it, but low nature resources  is the biggest reason about it. Unlike America or China, we don't have great nature resources. South Korea has been developed by trade and great technologies, not resources. For example, in these days, semiconductor is the most important thing in the world. South Korea has best technology about it, but we don't have resources to make semiconductor. That's why I want to change our country's location. If we were in better location which has a lot of nature resources, our country could be better than now.

 Third reason is many threat by near countries.
   Since past to now, Korea have  been threatened by many of countries.  As you know, Japan was the most dangerous countries to Chosun. And now, there's a lot of culture trouble with China. There're a lot of big and strong countries near Korea, and our location is dangerous to being attacked.  Because of our location, Korea was the most important place between Soviet Union and U.S.A. After that, Korea devided to different countries and we are still victim of that war.

   In conclusion, If I can do it, I want to change our country's location to better location. We can recognize location can change many things.  There're many important things that people want to chance, but I think location could include other components to change. Thank you."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

"For these days, many students are studying harder at level of high school and middle school. It sometimes look good because students can get some abilities from studying. However, it seems too much as students are studying a lot at school, academy and even their homes. Therefore, I want to change the education system of our country to become better for several reasons.
 First of all, it leaves students a lot of stress to get better grade. Because of characteristics of grading, each of students are studying harder to get higher score than their peers. For this moment, students get stress in comparing his ability with others, not solving the problems well, etc. As a result, it gives students a lot of stress of studying.
 Secondly, the purpose of studying is not going a better university,but becoming a good and smart person. In our country, students are studying a lot for going a better university. Because of their sight is limited to university, not the further future, when they go university they enjoy a lot like play games, watch movies for most of their times. Therefore, students are not studying harder at university as their high school seasons.
 Lastly, the spent money for education is too much. Many of students are going academy and some of them even go personal academy, and it spends a lot of money that even gives burden to thier home. Therefore, the cost of education of our country is too much.
 For these reasons, my opinion is the most important thing to be changed in our country is the education system. It gives student a lot of stress, a burden of spending money. Also, its purpose are moved for worse direction. "	3	3	2.5	8.5
2227	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  There's too many problems at South Korea now. I think the most important problems of those are population decreasing, capital only growing, danger of China, Because these problems make lots of other bad side effects. Therefore, In my opinion union with North Korea could be a great solution as a game changer. So South Korea's one important thing to change is seperate of Korea.
  The first reason that makes me think like above is I felt that Korea need to grow our military power while watching Ukraina-Russia situation. Korea also has a danger of china just like the Russia of Ukrina. Espessialy these days China keep showing there desire through presentation of president of China that opitally said Korea is an slave country of China and their act keep make Korea's culture as their's . Also North Korea is too weak now so that it's not strange whenever they collapse themselves and there's probability exist when that kind of situation occur China invade North Korea or starts to say part of North Korea's land is there's. At this point, Since North and South Korea keep their military ablility to fight with each other, I think unification of Korea can make our country strong. And when unification has done well, maybe  both Korea dosen't need to keep the number of solders and currency used to build that solders could more efficently such as invest to studying of future weapon.
  The Next reason is unification also solve the problem of population deacreasing and capital only growing of South Korea. I think when union occured, many of North Koreans want to move to more south resion beacuse there's more developed. And that could make South Korea's local more activity. For the next, through that kind of population absorb means direct growth of  South Koreans.
  According to those reasons wrote above, I think the most important thing that sould fixed of our country is seperate of country."	3	3	3	9

Currently, our country is separated as a north korea and south korea by 38 degree horizontal line. And also, two country are still resting war yet. 
One side, north korea, has lots of material and sources but they couldn't use it completely because of financial, technical problem. Other side , south korea, has  high-level technic and skill enough to use and apply sources, but south korea always has problem about lack of sources, so they depend on import sources.
I always hope the cooperate of two country with each country's strength, but it is hard to become real because of above reason, rest of war.
But, if there is a way to stop war, moreover, the way that could combine two country in to one Korea, our country become more strong. And I think one of the way that can combine two country is modify boader line as 39 line.

In real history, north korea was going to suggest 39 line, but south korea suggested 38 line before north korea try to argue about boarder line. If we modify this history little bit nice, we could get 39 line, and then something will change.
 
If boarderline changed to 39 line, south korea could get lots amount of field for farming additionally than now. South korea don't have to get problem about lack of sources, so south korea will be developed more faster. Oppositely, north korea will have more though time because their sources would be reduced than now.
Also, North korea's area will more smaller and closer to china. So china is more easy to controll them, and then north korea's power would be more weaker than now. 
Because of these things, north korea couldn't start a 6.25 war, finally north korea will be absorbed to south korea peacefully. 

In conclusion, I will change the boarder line as a 39 line, and than we can expect above results."	2.5	3	2.5	8

"Since I am a universary student, I know something different with Korean student and foreigner student. It is habit that present own's opinion or ask some question about what he or she can't understand. I am envious of their culture or habit that they have. So, if I have an ability to change something in Korea, I want to make some cultures that student present or ask freely in classroom or other situation. I really argue that this student's habit have many important advantages. 
  First of all, this can make classes or lectures two-side direction way. It means that not only a professor or teacher just delivers lecture contents, but also professor can communicate with students who are teached. In Korea, this type of class is really rare and also students in Korea not really want because of country's culture. So if we can change this strange shape of class, classes will be more active not only delivery oriented. 
 Second, student can understand more easily by asking some questions about what they don't know exactly and  what they want to know. I have many experiences about this situation. When I was a high school student, I had some many question especially in math and science class. Almost questions what I have was more deep contents than in class. However, I can't ask for that, because classmates who are teached in same class didn't like their rest time more lesser. So, I just keep in unknowing. For students like me, thae culture that sees student who are curious an stange person must be changed.
 For these reasons, I really hope to change one-side class to active class where they communicates each other and asking is reasonable.  "	2.5	3	2.5	8

Like this, we use electric materials all days. But, I think people use electric materials more than necessary. So, I propose that we should use electric materials less than now. 
 Then, why should we use less electricity ?
 I think it have the most important reasons. That is fossil fuels. Electricity is made by fossil fuels. Than, what problem can cause by using fossil fuels ? There are two problems. First problem is changing weather. The temperature of Earth is more increasing by using fossil fuels. It can cause melting ice in polar and also kill many polar animals like polar bear. And, our summer is more and more hotter. So, we should use less fossil fuels for not changing weather. The second reason is that earth don't have a lot of fossil fuels. The amount of fossil fuels is limited. In the future, people don't have the fossil fuels and find another resources. So, we save fossil fuels for the future. 
 In conclusion, there are two reasons why I think we should use electric materials less than now. First one is changing weather and second one is limited amount of sources. So, I think we should use electric materials less than now.  "	3	3	2.5	8.5

"If I had a chance to change one important thing about my country, it would be the location of it. I hope end of the this paragraph you’ll join me as well.

My first reason is that, we suffered from terror activities a lot in the past. Terrorists crossed the borders via tunnels hidden and they could do what they want in the whole country. This caused security issues and a lot of soldiers deceased. Imagine you are walking in a store and they suddenly shoot people specifically soldiers and their families. They were even able to stop your car and ask ID like they have the authority. Thankfully we passed these days but it cost thousands of soldiers’ and citizens’ life. If we lived another part of the world I believe we wouldn’t lose this amount of innocent people.

Secondly, the country affected mostly from the war that happened in neighbor countries such as Syria, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Russia, Georgia, now Ukraine and also problems with Greece and South Cyprus. This caused  our country economically and culturally unstable. I’d like to talk the about culturally first. Turkey as a country now has more than five million only Syrian refugees. Even in some cities the population of Syrians are higher than the Turkish people. This causes culturally shock effect and changing the country for good. For example I was walking in Istanbul few years ago and every store was in arabic almost. In the streets it was a blessing if I could hear someone speak any other language than Arabic. I can’t imagine how’s the situation now. I felt I’m the foreigner in this country. Followingly this amount of cultural shock and events effects the economy as well unavoidably. For instance, we weren’t able to develop our economy due to unresting in the area. Did you know that Turkish Lira is one of the money’s that lost most value during the Ukranie and Russian war?

As an addition, I’m a person who likes tropical weather. Changing my country’s location to and tropical area on earth would be great. Having the fresh fruits, never getting too cold, also enjoying different geographic locations would delightful. Swimming is my passion. I would love to swim every possible day!

Finally, I believe if I could change one important thing about my country, It would be definitely the location. If Turkey existed in another location I believe we wouldn’t suffer from the events I’ve listed above and I could enjoy the weather and have a pleasant time while researching about different type of fishes deep under the water."	3	2.5	2.5	8

 There are some reasons that the change of educational system is necessary. First, it is lowering the knowledge level of students. To take university classes, appropriate level of knowledge is required. But students now need to do extra studies since the highschool students are learning less. The gap between highschool and university is increasing.
 Second, the direction of CSAT and university studies are different. CSAT tries to set exam questions that includes complex calculations and several traps to trick students. On the other hand, university studies requires only necessary calculations, even that is solved with computer programs. The ability to find things to improve and be curious about something new is more important.
 Finally, CSAT grades can't represent the ability of students. Most of the students who are in third grade of highschool takes the test from 8AM to 6PM. During this time, they take exams in various area in a row. This makes them effected by numerous factors. The condition of that day, difficulty level which is not expected can disturb students mentally. And this test determines the student's next year: to retake the CSAT or go to college student wanted.
 Because of these reasons, I would like to change the educational system. We can offer a oppertunity to experience advanced levels for the students who made a decision of their future. For those who didn't, I would like to provide various classes to help them make decisions. I would like to make them study for their future, not for CSAT."	3	3	3	9
2233	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" If I could change one thing about my country I would make a railroad that go through NorthKorea. There are some reasons why I want to make a railroad. 
 First, if our country have a railroad we can trade more easily. South Korea is peninsula but the land area is blocked by the NorthKorea. We can't go through NorthKorea. So, we have to go further way to contact with other country. Therfore, if our country have a railroad through NorthKorea we can trade much easier with Europe countries than before and the cost made by the transport can decrease.
 Second, the cost for travel can be cheaper. If there is railroad through North Korea we can move to China and Rusia by  train. Then we can travel to other Asia countries and Europe by land. So, the cost for moving to other countries would be much more cheaper. And by the train the expense caused by the transport may decrease and the products can be cheaper. Therfore we can travel more easily.
 Finally, by the railroad the economy can be boosted. By the railroad expense caused by the transport will decrease so many other countris will try to trade with our country. And if traveling becomes easier lots of tourists will come and use there money. By this two things lots of money will be flow into our country and it can make economy better.
For this reasons I would make a railroad that go through NorthKorea if I could change one important thing."	3	3	3	9
2234	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Lately, I have watched the movie that is related with sexual violence. The criminal was very violence but the criminal only get weak punishment. The criminal get 15years in jail even though the victim didn't want to forgive criminal. Watching this,  I was really frustarted about this problem. So I feeled that the punishment for crime must be changed. Thus, I want to change law(punishment) about crime for the follwing two reasons. 

First, the punishment for serious crime in South Korea is much less than another country. For example, There was an very popular accident in 12years ago. The victim was only 9 years old and she get serious sexual violence by some man. However, the man only get 11years and 7month judgement because he argued that he was drunken in that time. There was an simular accident in USA. But the criminal in USA got punishment that he could live in jail forever. Also, not in this case, there are a lot of examples that judgement in Korea is much weaker that other countries. 
Secondly, we can prevent another accident. I have watched the youtube video which was interviewing with the criminal. It was young student, and he said that he did crime not seriously because he thought that he will get weak punishment. While watching this clip, I thought he must get strong punishment, so another kids will not do the same problem. When we change the law more stronger, people will recognize the punishment and they would not occur more accident. 
Therefore, I want to change the punishment for crime stronger than nowadays. South korea's punishment is weaker than other countries and  we can prevent another accident by changing the law. "	3	3	2.5	8.5
2235	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"What was your first expression when you first heard about KAIST? Many people think KAIST is the university which leads the science field. In fact, KAIST is leading not only Korean, but world wide science field these days. However, KAIST is not a best science university in the world yet. I think KAIST is not the university which leads the world wide science field because of the lack of interaction with non-science universities. Therefore, if I could change one important aspect about KAIST, I would like to increase interactions between KAIST and non-science universities such as Art Colleges, Music Colleges, Management Colleges. Following reasons are why I would change KAIST. 
    First, the collaboration will give KAIST students a fresh experience. Students who entered KAIST have very limited range of society. It is because they studied with similar friends in the same environment for a long time. They didn't have time to create a new relationship. Therefore, if they interact with friends in various environments such as music and art colleges, it will be an opportunity for them to experience new cultures.
    Second, science itself, can never success without others. Smart scientists make good theory, skilled engineers develop machines with it, and at the end, CEOs and many influencers who are not a scientist make people to be able to use those. If KAIST makes more interactions with others, 
   Lastly,  collaboration with other field always makes unexpected positive effects. Brilliant theories are not always came from science and math. Coordinates was developed because of the flying bug, famous many other theories are from non-scientific sources. If scientist from KAIST have a lot of friends from various fields, there will be much more opportunity to inspire them in unexpected ways; It will lead future scientists from KAIST to a big discovery. 
    All things considered, we can conclude that KAIST should have more interactions with other non-science related universities. It is because it will give KAIST students a fresh experience, science itself, can never success without others, and collaboration with other field always makes unexpected positive effects. I believe KAIST could be a even better university if they change this aspect. "	5	4.5	4	13.5
2236	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"We can see many problems in our university when we take a college life. Among them, I think cafeteria have some many problems in our university. Therefore, if I could change one important aspect about my university, I would change the cafeteria like Kaimaru.
    First, there are too many students who want to eat in the cafeteria in lunch and dinner time. However, there is a limit to take a sit in the cafeteria, so some students can't have a lunch or dinner in the cafeteria. I also have the experience of this situation. These students have to find another food store to eat or wait for the empty place. It takes time, but many students have a class after lunch time. Therefore, some students can't have a lunch because of the next class, and they can't take a class with a good condition because they are hungry. This is why I think cafeteria should be changed, so I want to build more cafeteria in the university if I could.
    Moreover, many students usually eat the same food because of the few number of menus. In Kaimaru, there are 5 food stores like Chinese restaurant, toast store, etc. However, I think there are not many menus to eat. Some people could think that there are enough menus in the cafeteria, but many students have to eat quickly because of their next classes or their homework, so they don't have enough time to try other food they didn't try. Therefore, they have a no choice without foods they have tried. So I think the university needs more food stores that is familiar to students' taste.
    Lastly, food stores in the cafeteria close too early. Many people have their own dinner time. Some people want to eat dinner at 5 o'clock and other people want to eat dinner over the 7. However, almost of food stores in Kaimaru take their last order before the 7. Then, students who have a dinner over the 7 can't eat at the cafeteria, so they have to call the food delivery and it take too many money for one food. Therefore, I want to change the last order time to 9 o'clock if I could change it. 
    To sum up, the cafeteria in this university is one of the aspect to be changed. Many students want to eat the cafeteria's food, there is not enough place to have a lunch or dinner. Even though they take a sit, they usually eat the same foods and some students can't eat because of fast last order time. These problems should be solved for our better college life. Therefore, I would make better cafeteria in our university if I could and make better college life for students."	4	4	3.5	11.5
2237	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" What do you want to change about your university? There is no correct answer about it,  but if I could change one important aspect about my university, I think I would change that our university has too many assignment.  Maybe this could be a great advantage to students, However I don' think so it would work always, therefore I want to change this aspect in three reasons.
 First, it does not have great effect and not efficient to university students. Just doing  many similar assignment every week would be helpful to grow up their grade, but it is not that efficient to make dramatic difference between doing many assignment similar and doing fewer assignment various.
 Second, too many assignments give stress to many university students. This kind of stress makes students physically and mentally unhealthy. As everyone knows that health is the most important, getting many stress is definitely not good. For example, according to statistics of the Korean university students suicide, quite many of student in KAIST suicide due to stress.
 Finally, it can also give side-effect to hard-studying students. Many people think that lots of assignment will always give positive effect to hard-studying students, but in reality, too many assignment rather makes students get tired of it and lose their interest in studying. For example, this kind of situation also called as burn-out in society.
 In conclusion, as too many assignment does not that efficient, gives many stress, and also can have the side-effect, I would change this aspect about my university. I hope my university recognize these negative effect of many assignment and make some change in assignment."	4.5	4	4	12.5
2238	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Kaist is a university that has lots of students from lots of countries. English is a language used in many countries. So Kaist uses English in most of the lectures however I think it should change. Kaist is a university in Korea so we need to make Korean lectures too. So the one important aspect that should be changed in Kaist is that the Korean language lectures should also be made additionally.

The first reason why Korean lectures are needed is that the achievement and actual grade of the lectures may not be proportional so students can get some stress because of English. Of course, English skills can be one achievement in the lecture. However, even a very good student can get a low grade because he does not understand English well. On the contrary, it is unfair because students who use English as their main language have advantages. In addition, some professors use professional terms that do not come out well even if they search. In conclusion, it is unfair that grades are determined by English, not by how hard you listen to lectures or how hard you studied.

The next reason is that there can be too much time wasted. If the lecture is conducted only in English, students should study the content longer to understand English. However, if there are supplementary lectures in Korean, students will be able to study more while reducing their time. The reason why students attend KAIST is not to learn English, but to learn the major field of study they want. However, if they lose too much time because of English, they will lose its meaning. In addition, this can be linked to the above reasons and even create poor grades. Therefore, supplementary materials in Korean are essential to save time.

The last reason is that English lectures may not be meaningful for some students. Although English is used a lot in real life, many people solve their problems of not being able to speak English using a translator in the developed world. Many people get a job or start a business without taking English lectures at other universities. The people who help with English lectures will be mainly students who go to graduate school. It's not too late for these people to go to graduate school and take lectures in English. So in university, it will be helpful to give an additional Korean lecture.

To summarize the reason why Kaist needs materials such as supplementary lectures in Korean is first, achievement and actual grade of the lectures may not be proportional, secondly, there is too much waste of time, and lastly, English lectures may not be meaningful for some students. What I want to say in the conclusion is that English lectures are essential to KAIST and are going well. However, if supplementary lectures in Korean exist, it will be a more perfect university. Students will be able to cover the advantages and disadvantages of English lectures at once."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
2239	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" The fact that KAIST is in Daejeon should be changed, so that it is in Seoul. Despite the fact that Daejeon is the city of science and technology, it is not the best place for undergraduates, because of the following facts.
 First, Daejeon lacks various cultural opportunities that undergraduates need. Students in Seoul can go on a picnic to Hangang river park, go to inspiring exhibitions, and watch funny plays in Hyehwa street. However, Daejeon does not provide such experiences. Thus it would be much better for students if undergraduate campus of KAIST is moved to Seoul.
 In addition, transportation in Daejeon is not convenient enough. In Seoul, subways are connected like a web, enabling passengers to go anywhere around Seoul in an hour. However, there is only one subway track in Daejeon. If a passenger's destination is far from that line, subway is not a good option. That is why students in KAIST rarely use subway to move from Daejeon station to their dormitories. They use taxi, even though it is way more expensive. If the campus is moved to Seoul, students do not have to worry about the cost of going to their home. 
 To sum up, Daejeon is not appropriate for undergraduate students to have various cultural experiences. Also, Daejeon has poor transportation system compared to Seoul. Thus, the KAIST campus should move to Seoul. There are people arguing that KAIST should be in Daejeon, where laboratories are abundant and technologies are evolving fast. However, because of these facts, at least moving the campus for undergraduates to Seoul should be considered."	4	4	4	12
2240	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" How do you think about KAIST? There are many good aspects such as scholarship and great professors. That is why many students want to enter our school, KAIST. However, there are some aspects need to be change about dormitory, study places, and study materials.
 First of all, the dormitory needs to be changed to make students do laundry more comfortable. Even though there are at least 4 cloth washers on one floor, it is usually running when we want to use it. For example, when I want to do laundry on Friday evening, I have to keep waiting for my turn to clean my clothes. Therefore, the number of cloth washers should be increased. Also, there are a lot of clothes in the lobby where students hang their clothes on the cloth hanger and let them dry. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the place to dry the clothes in the dorm. For example, if we make some resting rooms to be cloth drying places, then there are more places to dry our clothes. In conclusion, for more comfortable laundry in our dorms, the university should provide more number of cloth washers and expand the places to dry the clothes.
 Second, the places for study should be changed. Even though there are the library and N11 and many other study places, students still need to find proper places to study. For example, when I go to the culture building to study, there are not many sits to sit, so I sometimes just go back to my dorm room. Therefore, the sits for students to use have to be increased. Also, when students want to study at night, the study places are not various to choose. For instance, after midnight, students can just go to the culture building or N11 or other buildings where are opened after midnight. Therefore, many other buildings should be opened after midnight or for 24 hours. By making more sits and opening for more time, students can study more comfortably than before.
 Finally, the study materials should be given to all students. Even though some students get last year's exam problems from their close seniers, there are still some other students who can't get those materials. For example, the students who are in a club for normal highschool students (except science highschool or other special schools) get those kinds of materials from their club members who are in second or third grade. However, some other students who are not in that club can't get those materials. Therefore, the school(professors) need to provide the same official study materials such as last year's exam problems to all students. Also, If some second or third graders who got good grades provide their own materials, all freshmen can see those same materials and study fairly. By providing official materials form the university and personal study materials from higher graders can make students cand study fairly regardless of their relationships with higher graders.
 To summarize, there are three aspects, 'dorm laundry', 'study places', and 'study materials' to be changed in my university. Therefore, by many reason, those changes are necessary in my university."	3.5	4	4	11.5
2241	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   What is the point that you are proud of your university? I am proud of my university, KAIST, that it is the most authoritative institute of science and technology. However, there still exists a flaw of my amazing university. The campus is way too broad hence I would like to change the distance between buildings in the campus.
   First of all, it makes a big waste of time and health when students walk to one building to another. For me, it was a big surprise that I had to walk about 15 minutes to get to the classroom for my first lecture. Even there is a shuttle bus OLEV, students have wait for a long time in order to ride. Especially in summer, strong sunlight and field without shades make students exhausted before even they get to the classroom. This will eventually lead to the decrease of effeciency upon study, which is the last thing to happen in the best institute of science and technology.
   Secondly,  student of each department doesn't know well about the other ones. Since the buildings of each department is not close to each other, students have not enough chance to interact with whom studies different field of knowledge. One of the goal and direction of KAIST is to raise 
   Lastly, the broad campus trigger students to spend additional money. Since downtown is far from the campus, students usually spend their time hanging out with friends in Gung-dong which is the closest town with some place to have fun. However, it takes long time for students to walk all the way down to the main door of the campus. Therefore, most of them get a taxi or ride a paid kickboard to go to gung-dong instead of walking. Also, when students order food delivery in the campus, additional tip is charged for deliverer who struggled to get to the campus. This makes students to pay extra money for their leisure."	5	5	4	14
2242	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"After you graduate high school and go to university, what is the big difference of your life? I changed a lot after graduation. I changed my style, my MBTI changed, and my life cycle changed. I sleep after the sun rises and wake up when the sun rises the highest. Living with this life cycle made me happy because I couldn't try it at high school. However, I think there are bad effects of that strange life cycle. If I could change one important aspect about my university, I would change the waking up time essential to wake up early in the morning.
   First, you can use more time. At highschool, you had to wake up at 6:30 am and sleep at 1:00 am. If you didn't follow the rule, you got a warning. After you wake up, you started school with fresh emotion and actively move until you get to sleep. However, when you sleep after the sun rise and wake up late, your time you wake up will be to tired.  You feel you didn't sleep at night so you will be sleepy all day and it will make your day tired and useless.
   Next, you can be healthier. When you don't get to sleep, you will drink alchol, play or sometimes do your homework. At midnight, hormone realted to your eating comes out and make you hungry. If you are sleeping it di=oesn't matter, but if you are waked up you will order some fastfood and eat. This brings obesity and bad disease. Also, if you sleep at morning your eyes will be tired. Even if you close your eyes your eyes will feel the bright and I will stop you sleep deap.
   Finally, it is tired to change the daily routine after graduation of university. Many people will go to a company and work. Company wants people to wake up early to work. Living with a strange life cylce can be okay for your university life but, for your company life you have to change your life cylce a lot. Changing it with one time is very hard so you have to prepare your good life cycle for your future company life.
    To sum up, I would change the waking up time essential to use more time, be healthier, and for the future life. University gives free to students about many kinds of things like sleeping, waking up, listening to class, and quiting the class. However, there is a big responsibility of your choice. We can learn to have responsibility by failing the choice and sucsess with a good choice. Making a waking up time essential can hold students life cylce a little, to make them lead to choose a better choice of their university life and their future."	3	3.5	3.5	10
2243	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Have you ever thought what if you can pass the lecture by just testing? If you know or learn the lecture at the previous time, you do not need to take a class. At the KAIST, you can pay 20000 won and get a grade of the lecture by taking a test at the beginning of the semester. However, most of the test are just for freshmen. Many students don't feel the need of the test and don't prefer to take a test. There are three reasons why university should advertise for this test policy and make it bigger.
 First, students from science high school or gifted school don't need to take some lectures. Science high school and gifted school has many differences with normal high school. At science high school, students take a class like general chemistry, general physics and calculus that normal high school don't. These students don't have to take these classes again at university. For this, there is an AP policy, but university don't accept all AP class. Some school and some lectures are not accepted as AP class, so students have to take a class again. Furthermore, students who early graduated don't have any chance to take an AP class. For these students, schools have to advertise the test policy.
 Second, this type of test policy helps to use benefits of first year major-free. Freshmen in KAIST don't have major. On benefit of this is that students can take any lectures they want, so this helps students to think about their future. It is true that their are some students who don't have to take a class because they knew it or learned it. By advertising the test policy, students who passed the lecture can take another lectures that students interested in. This helps students to take diverse lectures and helps to choose their major or preference of study field.
 Finally, this can shorten graduating age. Students who have great academic ability can graduate early, but this requires a huge more effort. However, for school and academic field, these students should graduate faster as much as possible. By the test, these students can pass many lectures and graduate faster to get into the society or study field.
 In conclusion, three reasons why passing the lectures by testing should be more advertised is for the students who don't need to take a lecture, to use benefits of first year major-free, and make students to graduate more early "	4	3.5	3.5	11
2244	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Most of students in KAIST would have some complains in KAIST. Although KAIST is one of the most famous university in Korea, many students said that the location is not good compare to other universities in Seoul. So, I would change the location of KAIST. 
 First of all, Daejeon's transportation systems are not well-developed, especially near the KAIST. More specifically, I have to walk about 20 minutes to arrive bus station. There is a bus in campus that passes through whole campus, but it's difficult to ride because of long interval of arrival. Also, students can't use the bus on weekends. Moreover, there is only one subway railroad(number 1) and the interval of arrival is long. As a result, many students don't use subway in Daejoen. 
In addition to transportation systems, some students think that it is hard to contact with many universities in Seoul because of the location. KAIST students have to spend a lot of time to go Seoul, so it is hard to meet friends  there. For instance, many students go to other univeristies to enjoy festivals in May, but most of students in KAIST could not participate in other colleges' festival in Seoul. 
Lastly, most students cannot take rest at home often. There are some students who prefer their own place and want to spend their time with family. However, due to the location and transportations, students usually go home only once a month. For example, my roommate is from Jeju but he have to go to airport far away from our university, so he rarely go home. 
In summary, KAIST is great university in respect of education, but the location causes some problems. Becuase of inconvienet tranportation systems and location thai is far from Seoul, some students prefer other famous universities in Seoul, so it would be better for KAIST to located in Seoul.

2245	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"We Should Increase The Number of Restaurants in Our Campus
   Our university has a lot of good aspects, such as large campus, clean and nice buildings, etc. However, restaurants and cafeterias are limited and are located all over the place, and this fact is occurring a lot of problems. Restaurants and cafeterias are very important for students to enjoy their meal and get energy for studying. Although there could be an another important aspect that should be changed, I would increase the restaurants and cafeterias in our campus. There are three reasons for my opinion.
   First of all, there is a problem for eating in the weekends. Many school restaurants are closed in the weekends, and especially, almost every restaurants are closed in Sundays. A lot of students are in school for studying or other activities, but since a lot of restaurants are closed, it is hard for us to find a place to eat our lunch and dinner. For example, the restaurants that are close to my dormitory were all closed in the weekend, and I was tired to walk far from my room. So I had to buy a cup noodle for my dinner at the store. If there were more restaurants or cafeterias that are opened in the weekend, I could have enjoyed more satisfying dinner. 
  Moreover, restaurants in our campus are located far away from each other. By this reason, students have to go to the same restaurants which are the closest. This leads to a limited number of menu to eat, too. To eat at a different restaurant, students have to walk a long way which takes a lot of time. This is too harsh for busy students who have a lot of classes to attend. If more restaurants are added to our campus, the choice that students can make for their meal will be increased. This will be helpful for many students in our university.  
  Finally, since the number of restaurants are small, the line of waiting students is too long in meal time. For example, the restaurant 'Kaimaru' which is closest to my dormitory, is full of people in lunch and dinner time. We have to wait a long time everyday to order our meal and eat. It is very stressful when we are very hungry or very busy. This problem is occurred because there are too small numbers of restaurants in our campus. If more restaurants are added, the line of people waiting will decrease a lot. By this way, students could enjoy their meal with short waiting time and more various choice on their menu. 
  In summary, a lot of restaurants are closed in the weekend, the restaurants are too far way from each other, and also the line of waiting is too long. These problems make students stressful at their meal time. In conclusion, the increase of the number of restaurants and cafeterias will solve the problems of student's meal and will make our campus more happy.        "	4	4	4	12
2246	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Sometimes when I come back to my dormitory and pass by our floor's trash cans, I almost threw up. For dormitories, it is important to have trash cans and workers. Especially, university dormitories are allowed to eat inside and this makes lots of garbage and leftover foods. To be comfortable, my university has trash cans on each floor of the building. Even though it could be uncomfortable with further trash cans, I think trash cans should be located outside of the building.
 Firstly, trash cans outside can prevent disgusting smells and make cleaner dormitory. Leftover food makes disgusting smells the most. Especially, in summer this makes the most problem. For example, this makes lots of flies and because of humid weather, these foods easily be rotten. So, locating a trash station outside of the building can prevent smells in the building.
 In addition, dormitory cleaners will be easier to work with. Instead of going to each floor to gather trashes, they just need to take trash from the outdoor trash station. This will make workers easier. Also, this will make students in the dormitory, move around easier. For example, while cleaners are carrying trash from each floor, they use the elevator, so we can't use the elevator while they are moving them. Or, cleaners just need to make students use the elevator and they should wait for the next elevator. This makes them harder to work. So, for cleaners, putting trash cans outside will make them easier to work.
 Lastly, an outdoor trash station could reduce the cost and protect the environment. We can reduce the use of plastic bags. According to the science novel, 1000 years are needed to make plastic bags disappear naturally. So, making trash station located outside will save money and protect the environment by using lesser plastic bags.
 In conclusion, if I could change one important aspect about my university, I will put trash cans outdoor. This could make the dormitory cleaner and smell better. Even, this can help dormitory cleaners to work easier. Lastly, this can also reduce using plastic bags and save the cost and the environment. For a cleaner and happier dormitory life in the university, a trash station should be located outside."	4	4	3.5	11.5
2247	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" What is advantage of fast food restaurant? Why do you use fast food restuarant and eat fast food? I think it's taste, long open time and short time to receive food makes people to use fast food restuarant. But Lotteria in our university doesn't work well at this points, so I want to change Lotteria to other fast-tood restaurant for three reasons. 
 First, Lotteria doesn't have representative menu to attract people. In Lotteria, there is a 'Mozzallela in the Burger', but this bugger seems weaker than other fast-food restuarant's representative burger. For example, there are 'Bulgogi burger' in Macdonalds, and 'Ssai burger' in Mom'stouch, and there are main burger with lot of popular in BurgerKing. Except Lotteria, there are mania of each fast food restaurants with common popular, and I could tell Lotteria is not popular to other peoples than other fast food restaurants like Macdonalds, Momstouch, and Burgerking.
 Second, there are uncommon break time in Lotteria at KAIST. Students can't order hamburger until 6pm. Students only can order deserts like icecream or coffee. Lotteria in KAIST said there are lack of workers, so unevitably they recieve hamburger order after 6pm. I could understand about lack of workers, but wait to eat Lotteria until 6pm is quit late to eat dinner for some students.  In my opinion, fast food restaurant's biggest advantage is can order various time without break and long opening time. So I suggest use more workers to receive order more early than 6pm or having another fast food restaurant in KAIST instead of Lotteria.
 Last, student need to wait long time to order their hamburger and receive them. Unlike their name ""fast food"", students need to wait very long time to have their meal in Lotteria in KAIST. Usually student have to wait 30-40 minutes to order their meal at lunch or dinner time, and more time is needed to receive what they ordered. Because of this problem, I try to go little bit earlier than dinner time, but I couldn't order my meal because of Lotteria's uncommon break time. Usually, people go to fast food reastaurant to have their meal compactly, but we can't eat our meal fastly at Lotteria in KAIST.
 For these reasons, there are lot of complains about Lotteria. So I suggest change Lotteria to another fast food restaurant like Macdonalds, Mom'stouch, or Burgerking. If if is not sufficient, I rather suggest having more workers at lunch and dinner time to run Lotteria fastly. If my suggestion adopted, more students will go Lotteria and it's selling will increased, or more students can have their meal easily. "	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
2248	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Students at KAIST have to attend some classes in order to graduate. The general physic lab and general chemistry lab are one of the must taken classes. Plus, there are other lab classes according  to students major, so KAIST students have to attend more than two lab classes in college. Current lab classes are graded in ABC grade, but If lab classes are grade in pass or fail (S/U) students can attend more fair classes and learn more creative things.
 First, lab classes have many sections which leads to small classes. Lab classes have limit at lab equipment and safety problems so only 10~20 students are in one section. This is good for students but the by grading in ABC there must be small gap between letters. This can makes students feel like they are competing with other students. For example, some students can think one mistake from other students can make my grade better and this is not good for learning. With S/U grading, student can help each other and learn more things.
 Moreover, students lab report is only focused on getting grades. Every students want to get good grade. So they try to write there report to get high grade. But if students focus on only getting good grades when they write reports this can lead to some side effects. For example, there may be some error during the experiments. But student might be worried about errors so without finding why the error came out and just change the result to hide the errors. The propose of the lab classes is leaning about experiments and thinking about error is included too. So less pressure on grade of the reports can help students learn about experiments.
 Finally, lab reports are hard to find cheating. Some student might have reported written by other students. Of course, if students use reports to just check there error there is no problem. But, some students just copy their reports and change some word to look like it is their own reports and get high grades with low efforts. This can be big problem to students who wrote their own reports with a lot of efforts. So giving pass/fail can reduce some unfair ABC grade.
 In conclusion, pass/fail grading in lab classes, students can learn more about science experiments. Current ABC grading have problems  competing between students,  writing reports only for grading  and it is hard  to find cheating. I hope this change make better lab classes at KAIST."	4	3.5	3	10.5
2249	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"My university, KAIST, is one of the most attractive universities in Korea. KAIST has a lot of advantages; so many famous professors are in KAIST, devices and facilities in KAIST are brandnew, and students in KAIST can attend the course almost for free. Despite of these advantages, there is one important aspect about KAIST that I want to change. It is the forced use of English. there is three reasons why I want to change it.
  First, forcing students to use English when learning other subjects can lower the efficiency of learning. Students in universities begin to learn new subjects that they had not expericenced during high school, so they have to put more energy to understand the new concepts of subjects. However, If KAIST forces students to learn subjects with English, they have to put much more energy to study and it leads to lowered understanding of those subjects.
  Moreover, Forced use of English can undermine the quality of lectures of professors. I've attended lectures of Korean professors using English during this semester, and I had a hard time understanding some of Korean professors' lectures because of their inaccurate English speaking. I thought that it would be better If they used Korean when teaching their subjects. There is no doubt that they are perfect experts of their subjects, but forced use of English bothers their lectures.
  Lastly, English course existing in KAIST is not sufficient. If we want to use English fluently, we have to encounter English sentences and English conversation very frequently. Unfortunately, one English course in KAIST holds twice a week and it is NOT enough for students to get used to English.
  To sum up, forced use of English have three disadvantages; it lowers the efficiency of learning, undermines the quatlity of lectures, and English course is not sufficient. With these disadvantages, students may have a hard time studying in KAIST always."	5	4	4	13
2250	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" In my university, there are various characteristics that cannot be observed in other universities, such as the major-free freshman year, or 100% English-language classes. I think most of these unique characteristics are good for students. However, I think that some of these properties are not helpful for freshmen. I really hope that the club system of our university should be changed.
 First, at our university, it is very hard to join clubs.  In fact, about half of the students in our university have not joined any club. This does not mean that many students do not want to join the club, but it is difficult for many students to join the club. In our university, we have to write an application assignment, and we should take a test to join the club. For my example, I wrote application assignments for 4 clubs, but I finally joined only one club. Also, many of my friends do not have any clubs. I think this is a big problem that students cannot join the club that they really want to join freely. 
 Next, there are some clubs that only pick fun people, not students who are really interested in that club. I can understand the senior's minds to pick fun people in the club. However, I think that the most important purpose of the club is to express their interests in that hobby. Therefore, It is important to find a student's passion for that hobby, not whether the student is funny or not. 
 Finally, we can't join the club to learn new things. For example. most music clubs have auditions for students. And students who don't have experience of singing, but who really want to learn singing in the club should pass the audition to join the club. Therefore, only one who has learned singing or experienced singing a lot can participate in the club. And I believe that they don't need more things about singing. Therefore, they just spend their time in the club, not doing anything special. I believe that club can give a chance to students who really want to learn and improve their skills in hobbies.
 For these three reasons, I think that our university's club systems should be changed. I hope this club system to be changed soon, and most KAIST students to join the club that they want to participate in."	4	3.5	3.5	11
2251	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" What do you think if you can learn subjects in Korea language at KAIST? The greatest characteristic of lecture in KAIST is that all classes are learned in English. By learning subjects in English, students can be global person and grow their English ability. However, I think it will be great if freshman can learn basic essential subjects such as Calculus, Physics, and Chemistry in Korean or their national language. Here are some reasons about why it is good to provide Korean lecture for freshman.
 First, it will help freshman to adjust to college well. Study at high school and college is different. At high school, teachers always take care of students. However, at college, professors just give lecture to students. Everything should be done by students own in college. So, students can't find their way of life and study. In this situation, learning subjects in English makes students more hard to adjust to college. It is not too late to study subjects in English later when they finish freshman year.
 Second, it can revise the start point of study for students equally. In KAIST, the rate of students who graduated from science high school is much higher than from regular high school. The subjects and class in science high school and regular high school is very different. For example, regular high school students hardly do experiment and they learn subjects that are recommended to learn by nation. But science high school students learn calculus, physics, chemistry in more deep to the point that are learned in the university when they are freshman. It is really hard to understand the essential subjects for students who graduated from regular high school, because they learn every subjects first and lectures are done in English. If the lectures of the essential subjects are done in Korean, it will help students from regular high school to adjust to the university.
 Moreover, it will help students to get interested in studying. After having hard time studying to enter KAIST when they were high school students, students don't want to study harder and want to enjoy the life of campus. In this situation, lecture done in English can interrupt students to get interested in studying. Serious problem like students don't study anything can be happen. In order not to this situation happen, giving lecture in Korea will help students to be interested in studying.
  For these reasons, it will be efficient to provide Korean lecture for freshmen. Students can adapt well to University life and students from regular high school can enjoy studying without losing self-esteem. It will be great to provide English lecture after freshman year when students well adapt to university lecture and know the way of studying for subjects in KAIST."	5	5	5	15
2252	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Students Need Rest
 Sit down, close eyes, just breath for a while. This simple behavior, called ""Myeongsang"" can help people to recover their mentality. Just like ""Myeongsang"", students in KAIST need a time for rest.
However, KAIST isn't a good place to rest because the atmosphere of the school is ""hard-working"" and policy for students who want to rest for a semester isn't ready perfectly. This can weaken students' mentality and make them feel *blue-kind feelings. To prevent students from that, KAIST should change their direction of educating students. There are several reasons for why KAIST should change ifself.
 First, ""Hard-working"" atmosphere can make students exhausted. Some universities, such as KAIST and POSTECH, are famous for their hard-working atmosphere. The universities explain that the hard-working attitude is the reason why they can write a lot of good papers in famous journals. However, hard-working attitude can be a good method to be a good university that write a lot of papers, for students, this method can be a tool for killing-themselves. That's because, too hard-working atmosphere must require challenging with others, such as examination, interview. This kind of grading can make students stressed, so KAIST must change their too hard-working atmosphere.
 Second, making a exprience of having rest can make student act more properly. Students in KAIST are being stressed for a long time, such as middle shcool, high school and academies because they need to study more than others to graduate high shcool with great grades to being a student of KAIST. However, students haven't ever learn about ""how to rest"", this is why major of students in KAIST did not use their bodies and minds properly. For example, 
 Third, living outside of school can make students more creative. Rest for a semester or longer, students could live outside of shcool, and they could be a instrument of society outside of university. These expriences are new for students, so they can use those expriences to find a new-point of view in their fields. This can make students more creative.
 To sum up, having a rest for a semester or longer time can make students restore themselves who are stressed by too-hard-working atmosphere of KAIST and giving them more exprience about society outside university. Those are the reason why KAIST need to revise their policy and improve their attitude of hard-working."	4.5	5	4	13.5
2253	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" What problems do you want to change? For KAIST, even though it is named University, there are lots of problems that have to change: lack of social subjects for students, riding motocycle dangerously, and unlimited time-zone for entering the dormitory. Many of students think unlimited time-zone for entering the dormitory is benficial because they can study in other places until late or do not have to worry about unable to enter the dormitory after they play outside until late. Although lots of students prefer unlimited time-zone entering the dormitory, it is one of most important aspects that needed to change because of three reasons.
 First, if students are allowed to enter the dormitory when ever they want, they order food by delivery servies until late which distrupts others. For example, there was Champions League last week and lots of students order food such as pizza and fried chickens after midnight. They get their food by delivery servies which makes loud noise because of motocycles. Also, when they eat, they usually laugh and talk loudly. These behaviors cause distruptions to others who are taking a rest of studying in his/her rooms. Moreover, These behaviors can wake other students up.
 Second reason is that, since there is no limit for entering time-zone, students play and drink until late which is unheathy. Like ordering food by delivery serives it can cause distruptions to others. Forthermore, playing and drinking until late is not good for students. Playing until late disorders the sleeping paterns for students body and drinking until late makes a headaches when they wake up. Also, these behaviors make students hard to join mornig class which is not helpful for their University life.
 Finally, because students can stay out until late, they can expose to criminal situations easily. The crimial situation usually happens in night time and where there are not much people passing by. In case of KAIST, there is 어은동 where lots of students go out and play. 
 To sum up, because of unlimited time-zone entering the dormitory, students order food by delivery servies, play and drink until late. Also, students are easily expose to criminal situations. Although unlimited time-zone allows students to study in other places with no worry about unable to enter the dormitory, it cause distruptions to others and expose students to danger. So, even though major of students prefer unlimited time-zone entering the dormitory, it is necessary to make limit for time-zone entering the dormitory to not distrupt others and keep students safe."	4	3.5	3	10.5
2254	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" My university, KAIST has various pros. Since it is one of the best universities in Korea, it has numerous excellent professors and convenient facilities. Also, the system that every freshman students have free-major is one of the best advantages of my university.   Some people believe that KAIST could be a leading school of technology because it has only engineering and science departments, and can focus on science and engineering. However, KAIST would become a better university if it has various departments other than science and engineering, because of following reasons.
 First, students can take various classes when there are many departments. There are various classes about engineering in KAIST, but there are not many classes about economy, languages, or social science. As a result, most of students fail to take the classes that they want.  Some people take season-semester because they failed to take the classes that are not related to their major. Also, students can get brilliant ideas while studying various fields. For example, students who are interested in industrial design could be inspired while taking class about art. Students in KAIST are missing the opportunities to have these ideas, because there are not various departments in the university. 
 Moreover, students are not able to meet different kinds of people in KAIST. Since most of students in KAIST are interested in science, it is difficult for them to meet people who are interested in other fields like social science, music or art. Meeting various people is important because it could be a nice experience to share ideas about their fields. This experience would be helpful while conducting research about their field. Also, we need various kinds of people to perform a big project. For instance, to make a smart phone, companies need electrical engineers, designers, and even marketer.  Students could learn how to communicate with different people if they can meet different kinds of people in university.
  Lastly,   careers of students can become broad. Some students who are not very interested in engineering or science might want to have other jobs rather than researchers. This students may want to become a musicians, or lawyers. However, KAIST cannot support these students because there are no departments about these jobs. Therefore, students can have more chances if there are more departments. Also, more academic clubs about various fields would be held, and students could have nice experiences about career that are not related to science or engineering.
 KAIST  is one of the best universities in engineering in Korea, but it would become a greater university if it has more different kinds of departments. These could make students that are not only good at science research, but also  researchers that can communicate with others well and lead the project.  "	4	3.5	3.5	11
2255	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST is one of the best universities in Korea, and everybody wants to attend to this school. There are best professors, new experiment machines, and various supporting systems. However, kaist students generally feel one problem while studying here, meal. There are several problems in our meal system, and I think we should make more restaurants to solve this problem.
The first reason is that there are too few restaurants. There are about 3000 people in university, but there are only 3 restaurants inside school. Because of this, lots of people come to restaurant and makes a long line at lunch or dinner time. Especially on lunch time, students have classes before and after lunch. Therefore, they only have one hour to have a lunch. We can get food pretty fast after ordering, but it takes too long to order and they can't eat lunch. If there are more restaurants, every students will have meal comfortably.
Second reason is that students need to have a chance to choose. There are 3 restaurants and places like Lotteria or Subway, but they are spread in school. Because school is big and students don't have much time, they can only eat what they usually eat from next to their class or dorm. This make students not to be happy for meal, and to think about various food they want to eat. Some people can say that then to deliver food from outside. However, some restaurants cost more money for deliver into Kaist and some even refuse to deliver inside school. More restaurants can give students choice for their meal.
Finally, restaurants except for big 3 ones don't provide enough meal. There are Lotteria, Subway, and lots of cafes in our school. Students usually go these when there are too many people in other restaurants. However, these sandwiches are too small for students to be full. As university students live with lack of money, they can't order more or big ones in these expensive restaurants. There were restaurants which sell ttukbegi(korean food) or big kimbab in past. Students were happy with those foods, but they are all gone. We need more restaurants like this to get enough food.
For this reasons, more restaurants are needed in Kaist. Nowadays, students can't have comfortable, various, or enough foods inside schools. Deliver is not also a way to solve this problem. Meal is one of the most important problems to students because this can also affect the efficiency of study. If there are enough restaurants in school, students will happily have meals and study better, and become  better researchers. "	5	5	4.5	14.5
2256	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" In our university, KAIST, is one of the world popular college that has many school subject espacially the physics department is particularly well-known. Not only that, but there are the departments that fit various engineering colleges. However, I think it is better to have more diverse major in our university.
 First of all, it will be able to study more widely. With more experience, students have more scope for what they can do. Also, it can provide students with a diverse future. For example, before it, if we had entered a job through simple specification, now we could expand our future to other jobs, not to work or laboratories.
Next, a wide range of convergence scientific research will be the advantage for having diverse major in college. Before we have diverse major, we had limit for fusion research topic. On the contrary, the subject of convergence research can be much more diverse due to the activation of various departments. Let's assume that we study about AI.  If we have a lot of department, it will make us able to make various type of AI through the researches.
Lastly, as the number of department buildings increase, the college campus expands. When campus expands, there will be lots of restaurants or cafes which is facilities for students and professors so that efficiency can be improved because of the improvement of quality of life. For instance, the exist of delicious restaurant makes students happy and it makes them reduce stress for food problems.
To sum up, study widely is big advantage of college compared with other universities. Thus, a wide range of fusion research and expand of college campus is good for college. For these reasons, I think our college should have more diverse major."	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5
2257	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Most of us have our own nation, and some of us satisfy with it, and some of us not. Some people who have negative perspective on thier nation wants to change those unsatisfied parts. I trully love my country, however there are some aspects that I want to change: the Fast-Fast-culture. The Fast-Fast-culture in South Korea is a culture that people move and solve every tasks as fast as they can. South Korean Fast-Fast-culture should be replaced because it is not effective, it makes some problems between people, and slow problem solving could make us wiser. 

   First of all, Fast-Fast-culture is not effective at all. South Korean have that culture because we want to solve things earlier. However, if we force ourseleves to do thing faster, we will make mistakes for sure. Therefore, to recover those mistakes, simple tasks will become more complex problems. 

   Second, this culture makes social conflicts. Forcing ourseleves and others annoies everyone. As a result, it will bring social problems between each others. The culture which annoies and damages its sociaty must be chanaged. 

   Lastly, solving problems slowly able us to solve that more wiser. When we sove thing slowly, we can have various options of solution, so we can choose what solution would be the best option.

   All things considered, we can conclude that we should change the Fast-Fast-culture in South Korea. It is because in fact, the Fast-Fast-culture is the slower option, it causes some social issues between the team mates, and if we solve things more slower, we can make wiser dicisions. "	2	2.5	2	6.5
2258	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" If I could change one important aspect about our country, I would change the prices of houses in this country. I have a reason for my opinion.
 Many people think that it is hard to buy their own houses because houses are too expensive in these days. It makes young people think earning a lot of money is important rather than the others. I think this is very big problem. Young people need time for find their dreams and make their ways to acheive their dreams, but in these days, many people just think about money, not a dream. It means many people get jobs which can get money easier and a lot, but it doesn't make people feel happy when they work. I think  the country will be collapsed if this situation continues. This is why I would change the prices of houses in our country. If the prices go down, many people can have enough time to find their dreams and it would make the country healthier than before. It would mean that the country would be stronger than before.
 For the healthy and strong country, people's happiness about work is very important factor and finding jobs for dream is much better to be happy than finding jobs for money. If the prices of houses go down, it would be the trigger for the better country. So, I would make the prices of houses go down if I chould change one feature about our country."	3.5	4	3.5	11

" If I could change one important aspect about my country, I want to change that too many people are living in Seoul. As you know, while the population density of Seoul is high,  other region's population density is not. I think it must be changed.
 The reason why I think like this is First,  Too many people in limited area leads to decrease of the quality of lives. As the population density is high, traffic jam will happen more often. Also,  the more people  crowded  in one place, the more crime and thieves will be happen.
Second, It will cause unbalance among other cities.
If the population only increase in Seoul and not in other cities, it will naturally cause unbalance among other cities. As the theory of Demand and Supply,  some infrastructures that increase the quality of lives should be built in the city where the population is high. 
Third,  It is not efficient way to develop the country.  Because to more develop the country,  the population of the country should be distributed equally in all cities.  
In conclusion, If I could change one important aspect about my country, I want to change the population density of Seoul little bit lower.  "	2.5	2	2.5	7
2260	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  If I can change one important aspect about my country Korea, I want to change education system of Korea. In these days Korea's education system is famous because of it is difficult and harsh for young kids. I always though that I want to change this system. There are several reasons that Korea's education should be changed.
  First reason I want to change education system in Korea is because it makes children stop imagine. I saw in Ted that education in school makes our imaginative power weaker. Teachers tell answer to students so they can't find new answer by themselves. It makes that kids to think only way to find answer what textbook and teachers like. Especially in Korea's school we don't have class for inventing or drawing so student's imaginative power is getting weaker.
  Next reason is that it makes children to do excessive competition. In Korea lots of students go to college. Almost 90 percent of students go to college even if they don't want to go. Many students think that college is end of their education and in fact most of student study to go college. They don't have clear goal but following social flow. However famous college wants smart student so we start to make a line by score. This makes children to compete with their friends. Teenage students think their friends bigger then their family. Competing between close friends will be big stress to students and it will cause bad effect to their life.
  Lastly, because of harsh education system students get many stress. As I said in second reason competition can be big stress for children. Also many test or quizes will give stress too. Korea's children can not sleep well because of their tasks. High School students almost sleep only 3-4 hours in a day. This makes stress and hormone of body can be unbalanced. Stress problem is close to health problem so it makes student unhealthy too. Each year we can see news that student suicide because of studying. I think all of students in Korea will have lots of stress and that reason is education system.
  To summarize I want to change Korea's education system. And the reason is that firstly, it makes children stop imagine, secondly, it makes students to do excessive competition, thirdly, students get too many stress because of education system. I hope that education system in Korea change for students."	3	3	3	9
2261	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I would change the fact that we are divided to North and South Korea. I think this is keeping us and our country from lot of good opportunities.
 East, south, and west part of our country is facing the ocean. Only north is facing the land. If we want to get to Russia or China or European countries, getting on a train might be a good choice. But, we cannot go through North Korea. So instead, we have to take planes to do so.  If North and South Korea are united, or at least announce the end of the war, traveling up through North Korea can become a reality.
 Traveling is not the only one that is affected. The Governmnet of South Korea is spending a lot of money on the country's protection, and every Korean male of appropriate age must register for the army. It is their duty. North Korea is also pouring assets on army and weapons. I believe that if we can announce the end of the war, both countries can quit wasting all these assets so they can invest and grow up in much better ways.

 From the Korean war, not just the land but also familes have been divided. young children since the war had become grandmothers and grandpas now. It's too sad if they can't meet their families again. So parted families need to be reunited, soon as  possible, and I think the best way to do that is ending the war.
 These are the reasons that I would like to change the part that we are divided(or not ended in war)."	4	4	4	12
2262	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I was born in Korea and lived for almost 19 years. While I'm living in my country, I could see many big or small problems and difficulties. Among those problems, I want to change some COVID-19 policies. There are so many COVID-19 patients in Korea nowadays, so the gaverment can't consider all the patients and people who wants to have the PCR test. Therefore, I think the gaverment should change the policy about COVID-19 more freely. There are two ways that I thought.
 First, the policy to make people scan their QR code has to be cansled. The original object for the QR code was to track COVID-19 patient's rode. However, now there are too much patients, so the gavernment don't track patient's way these days. Therefore, the QR scanning is not needed anymore. Cansling the policy using QR code will make many costomers comfortable to get into some places.
 Second, the policy to make people show PCR test positive result instead of the fast COVID-19 test positive result if they want to prove that they are infected should be cansled too. Even though the fast COVID-19 tester has lower accuracy to prove the positivity, there are too many people to handle for the PCR test after the fast test. I mean, people have to do work twice and it takes more time to get the accurate result. Therefore, I want to make people just show their fast COVID-19 test result and confirmed to be as the COVID-19 patient.
 If I can change some policies about COVID-19 situation to these two ways, many people would be more comfortable and the country can handle the situation better."	3.5	3	3	9.5

However, I want to change just one aspect of my country, which is about our sorrowful history.
 Since long time ago, countries that exsisted on the place of Korea had been gone through numerous invasion from different countries nearby. During ancient Korean state, Korea had to fear several countries of China in order to prevent their invasion. Also, during the period between the late Joseon Dynasty and the world war II, Korea was under Japan's governance. As it is widely known, most of the people who lived in Korea during that period suffured from not only the discrimination of Japanese, but also the fear of loosing our own country.
Thanks to the ancestors who struggled to keep our culture and identity, Korea is now exsisting. However, the history left unforgettable hurt to Korea, and it laid lots of problems which is not corrected yet. Therefore, I would like to change the history of Korea so that our ancestors didn't had to suffured a lot and conflict remaining nowadays about history can be solved."	3.5	3.5	3	10

However, from the war our land divided and become North Korea, and South Korea. 
First, 38 line sperated family. During the war, family divided to North and South and  one day they just have a break of war. From that time, some family can't see there sisters and brothers forever. Even if North and South made a chance to meet, is a short time and they cannot know if their family died or not.
Next, 38 line made Korea develop slower. South Korea developed very fast and make computers and some devices. However, North is slower then South's develop. North Korea has lots of underground sources that South can use for development. Sadly, we are devided and cannot share sources and technology.
Finally, 38 line makes both North and South use a lot of money. At an article, someone compared how much money does it cost for military. Other countries need little bit of people and some money becasue they only need to  protect their country from others. However, Korea is doing a war just having a break. We didn't finish the war so we need lots of soldiers to protect south from north and other countries. From these reasons Korea needed lots of people so they started to make all citizens who are a young man join the military.
I think Korea will be more beautiful and develop faster if 38 line disappears. We can go to Europe by train, connect and share things by land, and make a safer country. From these reasons I want to change 38 line to disappear."	2.5	2.5	3	8
2265	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  School is very important facility for all country. Kids are learning and growing in inside of school. Nowadays, family gets smaller, which means many people thinks their family means only they and their parents and siblings. Due to this, an old fates that elder member in family teaches knowledge of life is no more possible. It's same as school is much more important for education.
  Students in Korea need 12 years for graduate elementary, middle, and high school. Students must finish these courses. My opnion is that this 12 years are not enough for students to think about their dream, their future job, and what they real likes to do. My suggestion is that provide a hundereds of chance of experience for children. Not only ceminar, also like visiting real facility and like others. So that, when children graduate ementary school, they could drow their future for a little bit more. And after that, at middle school and high school, with online class and more evoluted grading system, students feel free for grading and study really what they want and needed for their future job. By this, after graduate high school, students are almost complete for a single human for society."	3	2.5	3	8.5

"I want to change Korea's sports tranning methods. I heard that people who want to become sports player experience many awful things and I think it must be changed. 
 First, cruel tranning might be helpful at first but I think the player will get tired fast and the person would not want to train harder. 
Second, many Korean coaches want their players to be a standard player but it can cause players to be less creative. There are many articles about the problem that Korean soccer or baseball player is less creative than other countries' player. 
For these reasons, I would change Korea's bad tranning methods so that many sports player can enjoy their work.  "	1.5	2	2	5.5
2267	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I could change one important aspect about my country, I would choose education. Since I've been student for long time (about few decades) I know a lot about what feels like being a student. And I think their are lot of problems in the system of education. In korea, their is a national test called Korean SAT. On a certain day of November, each and every highschool seniors gather and take the test. According to the grade of the test, students apply to their universities and colleges. This seems fair and effiecient. I also thinks this test is quite fair (maybe the fairest thing on this country) but don't agree on the efficient side. This test is inefficient because it encourages students to solve weird-twisted problems and learn difficult and useless problem solving skills. What made this test so weird is the accumulated date about this test. Since this test took place for few decades, there are hundreds of thousands of problems of the past. Students learn those problems and teachers build problem solving skills to quickly solve the problems. As these two things combined, students who took the test this year are more prepared for the test than the students of the last year. Consequently, the test should be more and more difficult as the year pass by, and I think this test came to its extreme. This test should be changed. Students should study the subjects like language, math, and science, not the language quiz, math quiz, and science quiz. I think including more subjects and make sure the test includes more number of problems should do the work. These two would make each separate question less difficult and twisted, thus the students would focus more on studying the subject itself.
Besides, I also think the education system itself should be changed. On a traiditional education system, students go to school, the teacher gives a lecture. The teacher leaves students with knowledges and some homeworks, then the students go home to do the homework. A method called reverse class turns this cycle upside down. On reverse class, teacher makes a educational material(a video, for example) and the students have to study the material at their home. They go to schoold with knowledge in hand, enabling them to do some activities requiring basic understanding about the subject. Such activities may include discussion, debate, group activity, and so on. This way, class turns from one-directinal to bi-directional. And through these activities students can grow abilities like creativity, self-expressing, debating skills, etc. All of them are crucial skills for future generation. Some of you may wonder if this method would make more work for teacher to do. I barely taught someone on my lifetime, but in my opinion, No. Here's why. Imagine a school with 5 classrooms and a teacher. On traditional class, a teacher would go to 5 different classes and give a same lecture, 5 times. On the other hand, if the teacher adopts reverse class he makes a educational material and all 5 class studies it. I think it's a fair deal."	1.5	2	1.5	5
2268	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In Korea, there are a lot of features that are different from other countries. If I could change one aspect, I would change the education system of our country. There are reasons why I want to change this.
First, students feel too much stress about study and test. In Korea, grade is too important to students. We have to study a lot of subjects, and we should get good grades in all of the test. It's because all students want to  go to a good university so that they could get a good job. In fact that universities have limit of the number of students, they started to pick the students by grade. I think we should choose what we want to learn and enjoy the improvement of ourselves. It's not fair that students always get stress from studying a lot of subjects that they don't like and fighting with brainy students who get high grade from test. Many students even kill themselves by the stress of studying. I think this is not a good way to educate a growing students.
Second, our country's education doesn't allow mistakes. Mistake is a good thing because we could learn what we don't know, and we could improve next time. But in this hard education system, one mistake leads to the drop of grade. Students fight themselves to be perfect. I think this system is too hard for young students. Human is not perfect. We could make mistakes on calculating or solving the problem. I think our education system should be more soft so that more students can get the chance to make mistakes and feel the improvement of themselves.
In conclusion, I want to change the harsh education system of our country. "	2.5	2	3	7.5
2269	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" My country, 'Korea', is small, but very strong country. We have developed lots of skills like making a boat or cellphone or e.t.c. However, this is all in our country. We do not have large lands or lots of oils. This made me to wish to have a bigger country. Bigger country can give us more population, more natural resources, and cheaper houses. So, if I could change one important aspect about my country, then I will change the size of my country. 
 First, bigger size allow us to have more population. As we have larger land, we can make more crops and meats to eat. This make us to make more babies. The more babies we make, the more citizens we get. As this situation repeats, then we will have more workers to work and lots of elites to make our country better. For example, China has larger lands and they also have lots of workers and elites, and this made them to develop easily.
 Second, we can have more natural resources. Resources like coals, oils are essential in our lifes. But, we do not have enough resources in our country, so we should trade it from other countries. This costs  a lot. So, if we have bigger size, then we can have more resources and it we have plenty of them, we can even sell to other countries. This will give us lots of profits. For example, countries like Iran, Irac and e.t.c. earn lots of money buy selling oils. 
 Third, house and land prices will be cheaper. In Korea, there are lots of issues about price of houses. It is too expensive to buy. It is because we do not have plenty of lands. As we can see in United States, they have much cheaper lands. So, if we have bigger size, we can easily buy houses. Because of cheaper lands, there will be lesser apartments and we could have a nicer house.
 Because, we can have more population which can be our power, profits from more natural resources and easier chances to buy our own houses, I think I will change the size of our country."	4	3.5	3.5	11
2270	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I would change social distancing rules related in time in korea for few reasons. First, there are lots of loss to people who runs their restaurants. We could easily find out people's situation after social distancing especially time limit to 9:00 PM (nowdays 10:00 PM). Ban of opening restaurant until late time make peoples hard to run their place because of money. Government gave some emergency money to restore their place, but it is not enough to fill the lose.
 Second,  social distancing with ban of opening restaurant late night time, doesn't help to prevent spreading of COVID. I'm agree with meeting lot of people could spread COVID, but I think spread of virus is not according to time. I mean, people who want to meet will meet other people even there is a time limit. 
Third, time limit make people to get closer than before in special time. Before time limit, people in restaurant go to their home when they want. It means, not many people will get closed while they use transportation. When I was in Busan, Seomyeon, I saw all people in Seomyeon went out from the restaurant and all streets in Seomyeon was full of citizens who drink some alcohol or ate dinner. Lots of people in Seomyeon use subway alltogether, and subway was full of people. Like this example, time limit make people to get closer before limitation.  For this reasons, I would change social distancing rules, especially not making time limits. "	4	3.5	3.5	11
2271	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In korea their is good high- speed railway service that helps you move form one city to other in really short time. I also like to use railway services whenever i have to go to other big citys like seoul of Busan. This service help lot of students, office workers who has word on other city and people who are traviling.  Their are two kind of high speed trains in Korea, the KTX and SRT.  KTX is a train that is owned by korail and SRT is owned by SR. I recently got to know that their is problem with this two companys through news and i think these two companys should become one company.
 To find out why, we have to know why SR started their bussiness. SR started their bussiness in order to make a competition in railway service to make the service quality good. So SRT tickets are 10% cheaper than KTX tickets and many people said the competetion allow people to use hign speed train more cheaper. This seems like a good aspect of competetion. But it is not a fair competition. We have to know that many of the SRT trains are lented to SR by Korail in a very cheap price. Plus Korail does everything to keep the train working. They check the rail conditions, check the train and fix it if there is any problem and they sell ticket for SR. It seems weird. The important thing is that Korail in  a company that runs by the government. It means that our tax are used in this work and SR's profit is going to their company's workers. It is not fair to help one company useing our tax.
 Competitions between KTX and SRT is not a fair competition. In seoul their are two stations that the high-speed trains stop. Seoul station and Sewso station.  KTX only stop at Seoul station and SRT only stop at Sewso station. costumer have to use different trains due to their final destination in seoul. It is ok if SRT goes on every high speed railway but SRT only run on high profit railways so their can be people having inconvience.
 For these reasons I want to change the railway companys to one company that is runed by government so that many people can use the railway service more reaonably and to stop our tax being wasted."	2.5	3	3	8.5
2272	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   If I could change one aspect about my country, I would change the concentration of population at Seoul city. Nowadays, there are about ten million people in Seoul and if we expand the range to the boundary of Seoul, about half of population of Korea are living in there. This situation causes two problems in respect of Seoul resident and in respect of non-Seoul resident.
  First, it extremely increases the price of houses in Seoul . Because of drastic increase of price of houses in Seoul, so many people had to give up getting their own house and live in a small house  not enough for their whole family to live. This situation made people feel unstable and resist making a family. 
  Second,  it lowers the development of other cities and countries. The increase of population of Seoul means the decrease of  population of other cities and countries. If the population decrease, it is getting harder to get a new employee in that area and also getting harder to get more customers to buy products of companies in that area. It makes a lot of companies escape their own area to go to Seoul, so the result is the worse decrease of development.
  Therefore, I think that stopping increasing population of Seoul is the most important problem to be solved to make our country a better place to live."	3	2.5	3	8.5
2273	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I have lived in Korea for 17 years. Also I have traveled many Asian countries like China, Vietnam. Therefore I often compare the Korean culture, history or other aspect with those in other countries. Usually, I like Korean culture and history. However, I always thought that location of the Korea is very bad thing. I thougt that because our country is very small, close to strong countries, and far from the Europian countries.
 First, size of Korea is very small. I think that the smaller the land is, the less human who can work for the country, and it lead the weakness of that country. As we live in small land, population in our country must be small. And I think population is one of the most important part to make the country stronger. If we build our country on other land which is much bigger than Korea, population would be increase exponantially, and it will make our country stronger.
 Now, let me talk about the countries close to Korea. Near Korea, there is China and Russia in north, and Japan in South. This three countries have fought for more than 50 years to absorb Korea. Japan attacked our countries a lot of times during the Korean history. Many strong countries in China attacked Korean land for many times. Mongolian attacked us in1200s, and Russia tried to control our country in late 1800s. Moreover China and Japan is still arguing with Korea about historical problems. I think that if our country was built on another site that  is far from those countries, we might not experience those sad histories.
 Finally, Korea is far from Europian countries. Europian countries experienced the industrial revolution and increased the science knownledge and technology. Therefore, acquiring Europian countries' technology quickly might make our countries stronger enough to endure the attack from China and Japan. But Korea's condition was not good to acquire those technologies and we have to get them through China. I think It was the reason that we have to be controled by China.
 For these reasons, I think our countries location is the important aspect to change. Sometimes I think that our ancestors should have made Korea in another location."	3	3	3	9

" If I could change one important aspect about my country, I would change the land size. I think the land size of Korea is too small. Due to the small land size, we can’t have gained enough resource. I think the size of the country can have effect on the power of the country. If the land size of Korea increases, we can develop plants and new kind of energy. Also it will be easier to get green energy like solar power, water power and wind power which need large land. We can also plants many trees so that we can make air clear and save the Earth. We can save wild animals too. In these days, we try GanChuk business to wide the restrict size of land. It results in death of animal and environment problem. If the size of land increases, we don’t have to try this. It is really benefit that Korea is surrounded by sea and land. With this merit, the large size of land will make the Korea the best."	4	3.5	3.5	11

  Nowadays, many countries want to be a seller in global market of IT modules. That's because IT modules can be used our house, hospital, school... etc. They can be used in everywhere that needs rapid comunication system or wants some help from others in the network. Although, they are not only useful but also flexible. We don't have to prepare many things to use them; they just need a PC or a tablet to use them and many people already have those. That's the biggest difference of IT modules with the past-Technology that were used in many places - like ID cards -. People are being free of buying new things to use Techs.
So, that's why many countries  wants to be a seller of IT modules. 
  However, the opportunity of being a seller is not for everyone. To being a seller, they must be a ""delicate"" engineer first. Without having a great engineering skills, they can't improve the Technologies of other countries and make them to their own Technology. Because crowds don't want to buy a replica -they prefer to buy an original one. - , a country that can't make their own lost their power in the competition.  So, we must try making some ""delicate"" engineers to be a seller.
 That's the most important point. In these days, our country ( Korea ) hardly try making engineers. They just make a proletatrias that can work well in locked position, not in flexible position.This one is very critical for engineers who need flexible thinking and wide view. If this atmosphere of society maintains for a long time, we could never make a delicate engineers and never be a great seller of IT modules. So I want to change that point. We must try to see our country from the out of the box for a while. Then we can change many things."	2	2	2.5	6.5
2276	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  I think there are lots of things to change and improve in Korea. Such as education problems,  environmental problems, economic problems, and etc. However, I think the education problems should be the most important aspect to change.  Here are two reasons why I think we should change and improve education problems.

  First, the reality of education of Korea makes hard for students to think creatively. The most important thing of Korean education is score that students get from tests or tasks. I understand that  the tests and tasks are necessary things for students but I think usually it is too much. Too much things to do give a preasure and stress to students. Also, they make students to not think creatively beacause it doesn't help in tests for tasks which they should do for good score. So, I think we should reduce students works and make creative activities to encourage students to think in many different ways.

  Second, there are too many academies in Korea. I think people should go academies when they have struggles in specific subjects or want to study more . Hoewever, it seems that going to academies is a big trend in Korea. Although students don't want to go academies, their parents force to make their kids to go academies just beacause other people are going academies. I think it is waste of  time and money. Not going academies, and find what you want to do and what you like is more efficient way to spend life. So, I want to say  to students""Don't go to academies with no reasons."" For parents, "" Ask opinion of your kids whether they wish to go academies. It is not mandatory to go academies.""

  For these reasons, I think we should change and improve the reality of education of Korea. By reducing works for studendts, makig creative activities, and knowing that going to acacdemies is not mandatory, we can make ideal environment for students and for your kids."	2	2	2.5	6.5
2277	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  My country, Korea is a nice country. It is well developed, so people living in Korea can use many kinds of comfortable service like health insurance or free Wifi. 
However, Korea is quite different with other countries. It is divided in two, the North Korea and South Korea. After the 6.25 War,  Korea failed to unite these two countries. And the one important feature that I want to change about my country is this. 
  The first reason why I want to unite my country is that many people are worried about the war. Since the war is not end, North Korea is creating nuclear weapons and U.S army is placed in South Korea.  The conflict between two countries make people scared. Also, poor Korean men must enter the army because the war is not end. As we saw the war of Ukraine and Russia,  potential of war makes can be a big concern to people who are living in that country. 
 Second reason is that the country loses opportunity to become a bigger country. North Korea has many useful natural sources like oil or minerals, and South Korea has  many developed technologies to use these useful sources.  So some economists expect that Korea may become a way bigger country when they unite in one country.   Also, the traffic will be more comfortable because we can make a train that runs through Korea to China or other countries.
 In addition, there are many people who lost thier families after the war.  Divided countries don't let them meet and many people hope to meet their families . If the country become one again, these people can find their families.
 Because of these following reasons, I want to change my country into one united country, not two divided country. The unation of the country will make Korea better in many ways."	4	3.5	4	11.5
2278	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Every country have its own culture and special aspects, and this is more unique when the country has a long history. We could have proud about this, but not everything is good. There are things to be changed. The thing that I want to change is a dismatch between genders.
     One of biggest problem in our country nowadays is gender. There are lots of fight between man and woman groups, even from a tiny little reason. One example is that there was a commercial poster from government and  people said their hands looks similar with handshape which radical feminists are using. People then started to find every commercials that looks similar, even posters that are made decades ago. Fight between two groups are getting worse, while other countries tring to fix descrimination between man and woman.
     I think the biggest reason this happened is because of our past culture. In Choseon dinesty, country believed youguo(I don't know the name). In that culture, womens' rights were much less than mens'. Only man could have a nice job and son got all the money from their parents. However, Korea was the fastest country in developing. We didn't get rid of bad culture yet, but country developed and feminism came to our country. This is neccessary culture, but some of radical people used this to attack man, and some radical men attacked back. I think this is why the thing happened.
    Actually, I don't know the specific answer to solve this problem. But the biggest reasons are internet groups. Some groups that have wrong thinkings spread strange culture to others, and it is fast. I think making real names in internet could make this better. One reason that they can do these things because no one knows who they are. Finding these websites and blocking would be difficult, but would help too."	3.5	3	3.5	10
2279	"If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Actually there are not many shortage of my country, Korea. We have lots of traditional culture or many super stars who are popular all over the world. 
However, If I could change one  aspect of my country, I would like to change  working culture.
First of all, it is too stressful. This is because, lots of boss of workers wants them to  work  late night. Also, they want workers come to work early in the morning. This causes the health problem of korean workers. Not only the health problem  but also their  less after-work time can make them stressful. These problem will cause the less the quality of the task they are ordered to complete. 
And then, there are something wrong working culture over Korea. For example, there are so many company that make their workers drink. This could cause terrible health problem and even they say that they don't want to join the dinner, they give pressure by keep asking to join so that they might think they should join the dinner. If they don't, they are treated like the betrayer. 
So these are the two reasons that I think our culture of work need to be changed."	3	3	3	9
