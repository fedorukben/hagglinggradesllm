409	University:Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"I suggest that students should attend classes with following 3 reasons. 

First, You can learn more detailed and advanced quality. If you don’t come to the class, you’ll miss professor’s additional but intenisve information and useful knowledges which is not written in the textbook or other lecture materials. 

 Second, You can have immediately question to professor during the class about the things you have trouble in understanding. Some people says there are other ways to interact to professor like e-mail even if you are not attend the class, But since you should question to professor by e-mail or other materials and this would take much time. And for some cases, If there exist some points you can’t understand then you can’t proceed to next topic and this would be waste of time

 Finally, You can interact with other students. You can share question or opinions of other students since class would be interactive. Question of classmates is especailly useful because they have similar understanding level about the same topic so you would have more possibility to wonder about the same thing. This would help your study. 

 In summary, attending class is much better since you can interact with professor and other students and also you can take better lecture."	3.5	3.0	3.0	9.5
1375	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"If I can change one important thing in my country, I change  the recognition of success . We grow up , hearing that ""you should study very hard!"".  
It results  in a thought or recognition,  studying and making much money is definition  of success. However, I do not say studying and being  a millionaire or billionaire  is not a gauge of success. There is  three reasons about it. 
First of all , almost every people  have ther  own goals which is filled with things they like and love.  However, if their goals is not matched with other's expectation, for example, to enter the best university, they become weak and give up easily ther dreams.
Best method to engage in goals they dream is to change the recognition about criterion of success.
In addition, thoughts about the success in Korea result in more complex emotional problems. People think studying is the best method to achieve goals. These thouhgts cause students to recognize their friends as competitors.
Consequently, it makes them feel complex and emotional sickness. what we should give them is not emotional tiredness but motive to achieve their goals.
Finally, changes of recognition about success can make our nation develop compared with other countries. In the world, develpment of nation can result in high nation competitiveness because many people do their best only what they want.
Thus, Korea becomes wholy developed nation in many aspect of art, literature, study and so on.
In other words, we make efforts to change the recognition of success to make our Korea be filled with people who do what they want, feel happy about around people and are skilled with their job."	4.0	3.0	3.0	10.0
1902	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are many countries which I want to visit. But these days, visiting foreign countries is prohibited because of covid-19, so I couldn't visit a foreign country. If I have the opportunity to visit a foreign contry, I really want to visit U.S.A. There are several reason I want to visit there.
First, I have visited some foreign countries such as France, England, Italy, Germany, China, Taiwan, but I have never visited U.S.A. I want to go and see some famous landmarks in U.S.A. Two weeks are long time to travel a foreign country. There are many states in U.S.A and it is large to travel, so it is appropriate to visit for two weeks. And Temperature is one of the important condition to visit a foreign country. U.S.A's weather is similar with Korea, that is, U.S.A is not very hot or very cold so U.S.A is good to travel.
Second, I want to communicate with foreign people in English. I am not good at English speaking rather than reading or writing, listening. So I think visiting U.S.A can be great opportunity to develop my English speaking skills. Not only practicing English myself, but also talking with foreign people who use English would be very helpful to me. After I graduate the university, I want to study in a foreign country to get master or doctor degree. So increasing English speaking skills is necessary to me. 
Finally, I want to visit my friend's house. I have a friend who has lived in Los Angeles. He always said He will invite to his house when I visit U.S.A to me. So I promised that I will visit U.S.A later. If I visit U.S.A, I can meet my friend and I can sleep at my friend's house, then I can save some money. Also he can guide me to travel U.S.A because he knows U.S.A well.
In conclusion, I would like to visit U.S.A because I have never been to U.S.A and I want to communicate in English and I want to visit my friend's house. If the covid-19 disappears and I have the opportunity to visit other countries, I really want to go U.S.A. I hope I can visit U.S.A until next year."	4.0	4.0	3.0	11.0

" In Korea, Man need to go army 2 years by military duty. Recently, army is getting more comfortable because of advanced humanity and broadcasting real life and issues in military. Soldier allows their cell phone to communicate outside of base also they get more wage and short military period than before. 
 Even though military is more comfortable than before, still many person try to avoid going military because they think 2 years in military can make career distortion, lack of freedom and other several reasons. Some people think military is best place to clearing their mind and think about their future. But, this opinion doesn't considering why rest amount of time is given to soldier. Military is not a good place to do self-development. Many military base is in the country side even they located top of the mountain. This penalty can make lack of supplying resource from outside. Also, many base is lack of instrument because base builds too long time ago. So that, soldier has forcely their time that can't communicate outside well and situated lack of resource anvironment when end of day work.

1431	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"    What do you think the necessary points which people can be lived? Generally, people say the clothes to wear, the places to live, and the foods to eat. Besides three things, people need various things to live as human. In my university, KAIST, most of things consist well enough to satisfy people, but I think there are some deficient things in eating. Therefore, I would introduce why KAIST could change the policies related to eating.

     The first problem is the number of kinds of the food. As you look around KAIST, there are few restaurants like Kaimaru, Lotteria, Subway. Although Kaimaru has four types of restaurants, their menu are limited and the students who lived for a year feel that the food is always repeated.

     The second problem is the open time of restaurants. KAIST students used to late at lunch or dinner by their study or research. Then most of restaurants in KAIST closed in that time and the students should eat their meal in outdoors.

     In conclusion, the eating in KAIST has the problems in types of food and time. I think it could be solved by increasing the number of restaurants, and I hope these problem solve as soon as possible."	3.5	3.5	4.0	11.0
953	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Specialize in One Subject is Mandatory
     Recently, many discussions regarding how to educate students have been made. One topic in the discussion is about whether students have to specialize in one subject or take classes in various subjects. In my opinion, specializing in one subject is much better than taking classes in many subjects for several reasons.
     First, modern society requires specialists in one field rather than transdisciplinary talents. Nowadays problem that we have to solve is really complicated and is a really large one. This implies that finding someone who can take care of all parts of the problem is impossible. Instead of one convergence talent, lots of experts from various areas cooperate to handle one big problem by solving small, but complex components of the problem. Therefore, specializing in one area is important to handle modern complicated problems.
     Next, training experts is more efficient. Knowledge of modern society is too deep and wide to cover all areas. About 2 or 3 centuries ago, scholars of that era studied about many areas; mathematics, physics, and chemistry and so on; however, as humans accumulate their knowledge, the research area has become deeper and more complex than in past days. This fact makes educating enough level of convergence talent much harder. However, training experts takes much lower costs and is easier than training convergence talents. To sum up, specializing in one subjects can produce more competitive researchers.
     Some argue that training leaders who can understand and integrate ideas from various area is more important in modern era; however, such talented leaders can be easily replaced by cooperation of experts. Nowadays, the leader who can point the way to proceed and manage every component of work is vanishing. Instead, cooperation of specialists takes its place. Modern problems can be handled by cooperation of many specialists. Therefore, it is more beneficial to train specialists than transdisciplinary leaders.
     In conclusion, educating experts in one field is more efficient, and fits to current trend. In modern era, training convergence talents is not competitive anymore. Therefore, we should encourage students to specialize in one subject than taking multiple kinds of subjects."	4.0	4.0	4.5	12.5
2247	If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" What is advantage of fast food restaurant? Why do you use fast food restuarant and eat fast food? I think it's taste, long open time and short time to receive food makes people to use fast food restuarant. But Lotteria in our university doesn't work well at this points, so I want to change Lotteria to other fast-tood restaurant for three reasons. 
 First, Lotteria doesn't have representative menu to attract people. In Lotteria, there is a 'Mozzallela in the Burger', but this bugger seems weaker than other fast-food restuarant's representative burger. For example, there are 'Bulgogi burger' in Macdonalds, and 'Ssai burger' in Mom'stouch, and there are main burger with lot of popular in BurgerKing. Except Lotteria, there are mania of each fast food restaurants with common popular, and I could tell Lotteria is not popular to other peoples than other fast food restaurants like Macdonalds, Momstouch, and Burgerking.
 Second, there are uncommon break time in Lotteria at KAIST. Students can't order hamburger until 6pm. Students only can order deserts like icecream or coffee. Lotteria in KAIST said there are lack of workers, so unevitably they recieve hamburger order after 6pm. I could understand about lack of workers, but wait to eat Lotteria until 6pm is quit late to eat dinner for some students.  In my opinion, fast food restaurant's biggest advantage is can order various time without break and long opening time. So I suggest use more workers to receive order more early than 6pm or having another fast food restaurant in KAIST instead of Lotteria.
 Last, student need to wait long time to order their hamburger and receive them. Unlike their name ""fast food"", students need to wait very long time to have their meal in Lotteria in KAIST. Usually student have to wait 30-40 minutes to order their meal at lunch or dinner time, and more time is needed to receive what they ordered. Because of this problem, I try to go little bit earlier than dinner time, but I couldn't order my meal because of Lotteria's uncommon break time. Usually, people go to fast food reastaurant to have their meal compactly, but we can't eat our meal fastly at Lotteria in KAIST.
 For these reasons, there are lot of complains about Lotteria. So I suggest change Lotteria to another fast food restaurant like Macdonalds, Mom'stouch, or Burgerking. If if is not sufficient, I rather suggest having more workers at lunch and dinner time to run Lotteria fastly. If my suggestion adopted, more students will go Lotteria and it's selling will increased, or more students can have their meal easily. "	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
1751	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"If I could change one thing, I will change the method of listening lecture in my university. I think lots of classes are focused on only delivering knowledges. our most of classes are composed of only listening lectures.It has a lot of great adventures. For example, We can know a lot of knowledge and absorb the teacher's ideas. But i think that it will be dangerous to students in these days. There are three reasons in my opinion. 
First of all, Only listening lectures let stop thinking on their way.  I believe that we have to discuss and share ideas in class time. I want to say that making own ideas and thinking is more important than good scores in tests. So it is very important to express their ideas and share thinking in lectures.
Second, the method of only listening lecture is dangerous to fix their mindset.  It makes to focus on only taking tests in their lecture. Students have to develop own their thinking and mind. Flexible mindset can change the world better. However fixed knowledge can't change anything. In these reasons, We have to develop to express ideas with people. Only few listening lecture is necessary to students. But, the most of lectures have to change the method and processes. 
Third, the only listening class of lecture is old process in old university. Nowadays, there are new knowledge and ideas. In these days, Making new knowledge is very necessary point. So we need to find the new insight while sharing ideas with professors and students. 
Finally, Although I definitely agree to absorb the knowledge while listening lecture. But it is too dangerous to focus listening. In these reasons, I want to change the process of listening in class time. "	3.5	4.0	2.5	10.0

351	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"The impact of the development of computers is one of the most controversial issues facing the world today. Some people claim that computers have made life complex and stressful. On the other hand, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient, because of information accessible through the internet, globalization.
 First of all, Some argue that countless information including private information is opened on the internet even though people want. On the other hand, information and knowledge in the various areas are accessible via the internet. In the past, information was exchanged by letters or face to face meeting. Furthermore, a lot of knowledge was learned from books. However, since the internet has developed in the world, people can easily ask about the recent situation of friends and families. Also, by sharing knowledge in the media, a lot of students can get opportunities for learning. Even though inevitable information can be opened, convenient accessibility of information via the internet give people more interactive relations and educational opportunities. 
 Next, computers have made the world globalized. Through the various interactions with other countries, people can get an interest in other countries' cultures. For example, BTS from South Korea could be famous all over the world since their music videos and performance videos are spread fast through SNS such as Twitter and YouTube. The development of computers made people interact and share their cultures with each other conveniently. As the result, globalization has been proceeding all over the world. 
 In conclusion, the development of computers brings positive effects such as the accessibility of information and globalization. As some say that computers have made life complex, if people struggle to use computers positive, we can solve many problems with computers ."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0
1808	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad?	" Which country do you think is the best country to study. Korea is also good option. However, there are some people that studying in foriegn countries is much better option. Students who study abroad because it can be the special experience and the good chance to learn.
 First, studying abroad is special experience. Usual people have visited foreign countries just for travelling, and also there are people who have not visited a foreign country yet. Living in the another country is an unusual and special experience for itself. Not just for living culture, the way to study is different in foriegn countries. Studying in different ways is also helpufl experience.
 Second, studying abroad can be better chance to learn than studying in their home country. Foreign people have different cultural background and different perspective. If we meet them and interact with them,  we will have broader perspective. Another good point is learn English even fast. We use English when we should communicate with foreign people. It is clear that the longer time we use English, the easier learning English is.
 In short, studying abroad can provide special experience and good environment to learn new things. You should go abroad and study, live there if you like new challenge."	3.0	3.5	3.0	9.5
669	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Most of people want to success in life. Success is the most important thing to achieve, and it is not easy to most of people. Success in every project in our life leads to success in life. Some people may say that success comes from chances, and luck is the most important factor in success. However, I think success is the result of careful and sophisticated planning.
 First, success without careful planning is easy to fail later. Success with luck is that all factor of project are good state, and they are not made of you. Therefore, if one factor in project becomes wrong, it is not easy to fix the factor and make all factors good again. Then, several factors becomes wrong, and you don't know how to fix them, and the project would fail. However, if we know about all plans in the project, we can know what goes wrong immediately, and we can fix what goes wrong as soon as possible. Some people might say that success with careful plannig also cannot cover all factors in the project. However, it is much better that some main factors can be fixed if they go wrong than that we do not know what to repair.
 Second, people can repeat success with careful planning in the simillar situation. We will encounter simillar situations if we do project in the same subject. The factors that influence the simillar situation are same in the previous situation we success. As we experience the simillar situations again and again, we can accumulate the ways which are helpful to success in the project. Therefore, we can success easily in the next project and it leads to success in life.
 Lastly, we can share our work with our colleagues with careful planning. We cannot do the big project alone, so we need to collaborate with other people. However, if we do not know overall plans in the project, we cannot share our thoughts or plans with other people. It makes the success of the project slower, or it can be result in failure in the project. Sharing the same plans is important to collaborate in the same project. We can get help by other people easily when we explain where we need help.
 In conclusion, success with good plans can fix what goes wrong, repeat the success in similar situations, and share our work with our teammates. Although there is no perpect plan to success, we need to do our best to plan carefully and make good plan. Good plan and your efforts lead to success in your life."	3.5	3.0	3.0	9.5
441	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Education programs in these days usually encourage people to discuss their thinking with others. Some professors in KAIST even tell students to study as a group. However, there are still lots of debate about studying with a group is efficient or not. I personally think that studying together eventually enhance performance in perspective of getting knowledge.

Some might said that studying with a group will cause significant decrease of patience. However, there are lots of researches that studying with friends with same goal make the group to accomplish faster than studying alone. It may decrease patience sometimes, but group with aligned purpose will succeed at the end. Also, there are some opposing argument that studying alone is efficient when time is limited. However, studying is not just activity to prepare for single test. We should study forever to develop myself and become better person. Therefore, thinking study as time-attak task is not right. In addition to these couterarguments to the claim that  studying alone is better, there are several reasons why studying as a group is better.

First reason is that studying as a group will eventually make that group to acoomplish goal very concisely. If we study together, we usually have time to test that my knowledge is right. By doing this, we can figure out that we are doing right now. As I said above, study is not time-attack task. We should make castle of knowledge as concrete as possible. Studying with group will help me to get exact knowledge. 

Second reason is that studying as a group will encourage group to overcome some difficult task. If we study some very hard fields, there might be some point that nobody knows how to solve some problem. Then thinking as a group will make me to overcome this. There is word “group intelligence”. This means thinking as a group has more diversity and even more concreteness than thinking as individual. In perspective of getting knowledge, group study will help to find unsolved problem. Even you cannot find solution, experience with different point of view will make your life more flexible than before. 

As I wrote, despite of opposing arugments that studying alone is better, there are quite lots of good reasons that we should study as a group. Human is social animal. We can become top predator of Earth, since we are the animals that can communicate the most complex than others. If we study as a group, we will not only learn about that field concisely, but also learn how to solve hard problem with communication. If we go out to society and work, these will me the most valuable experience. I hope every students in KAIST know this things and help each other to become leader of world."	4.5	4.5	4.0	13.0
1284	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" If I could change one important thing about my country, I would change the language that lots of country use, such as english.

 First, we don't have to learn foreign language. In my country, most of student spend a lot of time to study english. If we use common language, we can save that time and do other things. Also the stress from the study would be decreased. It would be really helpful to student.

 Second, we can communicate easily with foreign people. The easier communication would promote the collaboration with other country. And the collaboration would improve the study, company, literature, art, etc. We can enjoy the better quility of many things.

 Finally, we can go traveling more comfortablely. There are lots of uncomfortable things because of the difference of the language. If we can't speak foreign language, we need the translation machine or guide. However, if the languages that used in other country and my country are same, we wouldn't need them.

 As these reason, I would change the language if I could change one important thing about my country."	3.5	4.0	3.5	11.0

483	University: Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Free Education
          Many students want to enter better college to take better education. Many students in good universities are satisfied because their college have high-quality education, but students in low universities are dissatisfied because the quality of their classes is not good. Although some people think that higher education should be given only to good students, making education available to all students is better.
          First of all, education inequality will decrease. Some students have a hard time to study because of their family or money. If the change of education is given only good students, these poor students will not get knowledge and education inequality will increase. However, if higher education become available for every students, student can learn regardless of their situation.
          In addition to knowledge, better education make world better. Since the quality of lecture is depend on professor, academic performance can be effected by the quality of lecture. If students can study with well-made lecture, their performance will increase; as a result, a society will be improved.
          Some argue that education should be available only to good students because they study hard to enter the university. However, the essence of university is to explore the truth. Therefore, if someone want to explore the truth, university should welcome them. 
          To sum up, the change of education should be given to all students. Since the knowledge is not belong to someone, every students should be guaranteed the right to learn. Also, if education is given to every students, inequality will decrease and the world become better. Therefore, university should provide education for all students."	4.0	4.0	3.5	11.5

A famous society said that humanity is so society animal so we can't live alone. All of people want to make great friends. I'm also belonging here. Then, What is the qualities of a good friend. Now, let me introduce my opinion about this topic. 

 I think that there're three things to be a good frind. First, kindness is important quality of a good friend. Let's think about one situation. One day, you're in school at rainy day. However, you don't bring an umbrella. This is so sad and common situation, isn't it? You tries to go home so tell your situation to your friend. If your freind is not kind enough to use his(her) umbrella with you, he ignore you and just go alone. But if your friend is kind enough, you can go home without wet. This is trivial but common example about kind friend. However, if your friend isn't kind enough to use his umbrella, you can't go home without wet. Furthermore, you may have a cold and can't go school the next day. That situation is trivial thing but it may go bad. Thus, kindness is important and why kindness can be a quality of a good friend.

 Second, fun friend is important to play anything. All people may have an experience to play with their friends. If there aren't fun friend, the mood among the friends and you may go to cold. Then, you think that if there're fun friend, we can play more and more fun. and if you have some bad thing, the fun friend can make you happy. Ofcourse, It can't be a good friend who is fun but do not think your mind and behave just he(her) want. This is not healthy relationship and in the future, you and your fun friend's relationship may go bad in high percentage. 

  Finally, sensitive friend is nessesary through your life. If you have bad thing like fighting with you parents, this friend can be a good counseller. With them you can be more mature and can learn their considerable things through their behavior. This is good friend also. 

 These are three qualities of a good friend that I think. Every people want to make good and best friend. However, most of them don't see back theirselves. I want to say some sentence and end of this writing. To make good friends which I said, you should be a good friend first. Thank you for reading my opinion and I'll end this writing here.

Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.             	"I believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. There are several reasons that support my view. First, I think that there is no proper way to select ""good"" students. Some students, who have enough money, are already available with great education while others don't. Therefore, evaluating students to give a higher education itself would be unfair. Students who already can get high-quality education will easily pass the exam for evaluation. Secondly, higher education have to be provided to students who WANT to study more, not to students who are GOOD at studying. Everyone has the right to learn what they want to learn. It makes a much larger possible choices for people to select a right job. That diversity helps to form a creative and happy society. Some people may say that giving an lecture or providing various resources requires too much money to be available to all students. They insist that it is simply not effective. However, I think that the cost can be reduced by recording lecture video and provide it or just encourage students collaborate on studying. I also think that the social benefits that comes after good education are much greater than the cost. Everyone has the right to learn to make their lives better. Society have to support members to study and select a job that they really want. Therefore, it is essential that higher education can be accessible to all people."	4.0	3.5	3.5	11.0

Today, I'm going to talk about hobbies for college students, why am I recommend to have a hobby and what  hobby ia a good for you.
     To have your own hobby has many adventages. I think many high school students of Korean have no hobbies because of study. So I understand you who is freshman in Korean college have no hobbies. but, I think you experience a situation that you study all day. At that time, you may be tired, stressful, and hate study. So you should have some hobbies to relax and reduce stresses. Also, hobbies may make your another dreams or new friends through hobbies activity. For these reasons I think there are no reasons not to have hobbies.
     Then what hobbies is a good choice for college students. The best Choice is having club about you like. Because, if you have club, you can make new friends and enjoy activities steadily with your friends. Among lots of clubs, sports clubs is the best best choice. If you have sports club, there are so many adventsges including before I talked. You can make your hobbies to play sports, exercise makes you more healthy, and you can enjoy and learn sports that you like . So, To enter sports club means that you have hobbies and you can be more healthy. I recommend to have sports club.
     If you have another interseting like music, dancing orsomething , clubs about it is also a good choice.  But although you don't have thought about sports, because of reasons I talked How about apply sports club?"	1.5	2.0	1.0	4.5

It is so variable even some people came from other country. each country has different things in culture and geological. So, many people has different view and has opinion about important one things what they want country to change So, I want to introduce just one thing  what I want country to change in following reasons. It is a bully in Korean students. My country, South korea should not have bully in student society. 

 First, For almost students, school is their biggest society. Students in Korea have to go school in everyday except weekend. For instance, if one student jiho bully other student juno, juno's society will destroy by physical and language violence of jiho. It is not fair to juno and other students.

 Second, Being Bullied cause PTSD to one or more students. If one person got bullied in neiborhood, a chance of that person to grow to mental-healty adult will decrease because he will have negative behavor for everything.

 Thesedays, many witnesses of bully disclose what happend in school about the enterteinment world.It will be goodflow for our society. So, If i could change one important thing about my coutry Korea, what I want is  disappearing of bully."	3.0	2.5	2.5	8.0
189	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are two types of students about their study : students who study alone and who study with a group of students. It depends on each one's preference, but i think studying alone is better in terms of concentration, efficiency, and internalization.

           First of all, you can concentrate better in studying alone than group studying. While studying alone, you can care only contents and your comprehensions.

But in a group studying, interacting with other students is not avoidable, so you are supposed to care about things that are not related your learning : chatting with others, checking other's comprehension about contents. This disturbs you to concentrate and leads to low learning efficiency than studying alone.

          Secondly, you have to notice an importance of studying alone, not together. To master the contents or subjects, you firstly have to hear a basic explanation about them, secondly, have a time to understand and practice on your own.  The first step can be carried in many ways : asking a teacher, googling. But the second step is an internalizing step for you, so it can be carried only by studying alone that contains your own thoughts, comprehension. The group studying can not do this. 

It is just a repeat of the first step with other students.

         So far, I have talked about the reasons I insist studying alone is a better way compared to the group studying. Studying alone can bring you a better grade and deeper comprehension with better concentration and internalization that the group studying does not have."	3.0	3.0	3.5	9.5
1702	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" Many people have smartphone these day. Because of that, we can talk to each other whenever and wherever we are. Before, we didn't talk to each other because there wasn't a way to do. I think that smartphones are helping communication for three reasons.
 First, we can communicate wherever and whenever it is. Smartphone made it able to communicate even though it is far apart. If we can access to the internet the location doesn't matter. Also, we can talk to each other even in the early morning and in the midnight.
 Second, it is easier to make some new friends. Before, we needed to meet each other to get closer. Now, we can talk online and make new friends. For example, I made new friends few weeks before going to high school by online.
 Lastly, it is able to see the conversation that had before. Because it is hard to remember everything we talked about, sometimes I forget about what we talked before.
  In conclusion, smartphones are making communication easier than before. It is able to communicate wherever and whenever it is. Also, it is easier to make new friends. Because of smartphone, it is able to see the previous conversations. For the three reasons above, I think that smartphone helped communication among friends and family. "	4.0	3.5	3.5	11.0
1085	Lifetstyle: Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"Benefits of Getting Up Early
     Throughout history, work-week has been shortened from 7 days to 5 days. Even in a day, employers have reduced working hours to 8-9 hours. With this shortened schedule, there are two types of workers. Some say getting up early and finish early in the evening is better while others say getting up later and working until late at night is better. In my opinion, getting up early has several benefits. 
     First of all, schedule of society is fixed to day workers. In school, students must attend at 9 a.m, so waking up late is impossible. Likewise, company usually fixed their schedule from 9 to 6, so night workers will substituted with day workers if they try to follow their own schedule. Moreover infrastructures such as transportation and shopping stores stop their operation in late night. Night workers cannot use them after finishing work.
     In addition to main schedule of society, getting up early is good for physical health. Usually, night workers skip dinners or eat foods with low nutrition, while day workers eat healthy foods 3 times a day. It makes them healthier. For example, day workers eat at restaurant in company, and night workers eat foods from delivery stores.
     Some argue that there are night workers who are suitable for getting up late, for it makes them more productive. Although companies like start-ups shift their work hours to match the individual life rhythm, this new phenomenon is not widely adapted yet. Before this culture is settled, day workers will have high productivity than night workers who work in companies which have usual fixed schedule.
     To sum up, day workers have several advantages. They matched with main schedule of society which is 9 to 6, and have healthy foods. Despite of efforts to free the individual schedule, it is not widely spread. Until working hours become elastic, getting up early is better strategy than night working."	4.5	4.5	4.5	
603	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"  As modern young grown-ups are communicating with various people including not only family but also friends, opinions whether the former has the most important influence on young adults or the latter does are divided into two groups. Even though some people state that the family is the most important influence on young adults, friends are the most important influence on young adults.
  Above of all, young people are more likely to interact with their friends than family. Since most of them are university students, they may usually  stand on their own; that is, they live apart from their family. Rather, they are prone to get along with their friends. For example, a large number of KAIST students who dwell in dormitories join clubs, which offer a variety of activities with their friends. I heard that some of them eventually establish a start-up, but there are few companies founded with one's family.
  Next, friends may have similar points of view. According to a research conducted by numerous psychologists, groups of people consisted of members who had spent their young ages in similar era are inclined to share common points of view. Therefore, young grown-ups can easily share their ideas and feel a kind of sympathy with their friends.
  Meanwhile, some people insist that the family have a great impact on young adults, based on the amount of time that young people had spent with family. However, adults make their own way by experiencing various events and conducting several roles in our society with friends. In other words, the time spent with family does not ultimately determine one's points of view.
  For the reasons suggested above, young adults are mainly affected by their friends than their family. Thus, try to interact with a number of good friends as many as possible."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0

648	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"There are many argument that it is good to do easy work or not. Some people think that doing only what they already do well is good because it doesn't require any effort. On the otherhand, Many people believe it is great to do something risky because they can get some worthy experiment. Although there are many benefits when we do easy things,   I think it has more good affect to me to do something unfamiliar.

 First and most important reason for it is that we can not do what we have done everytime. When we go to high school, everything we have to learn is alway newthings. Also at universty, we have to learn more deep theory and have to do some unfamiliar things. We just have to adapt to something new everytime, everywhere. 

 By doing some new things, we can experience many things that we haven't had yet. For example, I was afraid to do some research program because I haven't done it before. But I tried to work hard and I could learn many research skills such as manual of reading cylinders and skills of writing reports. Also, by doing some chemistry research project, I could make a decision to go to science highschool. If I had not done some experiment when I was young, I couldn't have gone to this university, KAIST. 

 As we get more experience of new works, we will have more confidence of trying. This ""trying"" can change someone's life. So, I recommend my friend to do something new. I want to say people who worry about 
 trying ;  ""Don't hesitate to do something unfamiliar. It can change your life."""	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
464	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"During the exam period, KAIST students study according to their own study style. Some students study alone in the dormitory or library, and another students study together in a classroom. Some people say that studying with a group of students can cause you to lose concentration and interfere. However, this should not be seen as a problem.  Rather, group studying helps to improve study efficiency.

Until now, many have argued that people become nosiy when they study together. If you study alone, you just blank out of a while.  However, you can waste all your time for chatting when you study with your friends. Maybe, but when you're with the friends, you could save time to waste. For example, when studying alone, there is no one watching, so you keep looking at your cell phone. On the other hand, if you study with a group, another friend can give you a warning whenever you don't concentrate on studying.

There is an advantage when you study with a group of students.  It is easy to solve your curiosity  if you study together. When you are alone, you can solve the problem through only the internet. Or, you have to ask someone else later, so it's hard to solve the curiosity right away. However, you can have a discussion about the problem when you study with your friends. Also, there might be a student who has the same question as you. Or, you may already have a friend who knows the answer to the question. You can share your knowledge with each other and study more deeply.

To sum up, study efficiency is increasing when you study with a group of students. First, you can concentrate on studying  because your frends can give a caution. Also, you can study more deeply for a discussion with your study members. What about study with your friends? You can get higher score for your test."	4.0	4.0	4.5	12.5
1693	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Many students in our college know what we have to take a course or reach scores to graduate KAIST. And most of us generally choose the most difficult one to achieve graduating condition is physical AU. We need to take at least two of them without club activities since it requires 4 AU and each of class gives us 2 AU score. But the problem is that all of those courses has really low attending limit, so we cannot easily take it. So, some students suggest that if one go dedicate to national defence by being soldier for 18 months, then he can get 2 physical AU. I totally agree with this statement and I would like to explain why I think in this way.
 First reason is that there are increasing students who feel that the period when they work for troop is just wasting time. As alternative way in our school gets even harder to conduct, many students are considering working for national defense. Nevertheless, almost all of us do not want to go there and we even cannot take any course what we want to take in there. Thus, if we can get AU by going there, we can get meaningful result on our requirement of graduation even it is small.
 Second, we can potentially expand the attending limit of those courses. As I have introduced, it is really difficult to take physical activity courses. For me, I could not take even one of them for six semesters, even though I always have handed in that I wanted to take those courses. However, if we were able to get 2 AU from other activity, the demand for those course would be lowered and this might allow us to take them more easily.
 To sum up, I hope our college gives us 2 AU by conducting the national defends for the above reason I have explained. Even though there are some opposite opinions regarding this idea, but I believe KAIST needs to be a college which carefully hears the opinion of their students. Also, I hope our school president would consider this idea and we can get a positive outcome by that."	4.5	4.0	3.5	12.0

But I always try to do my best in doing what I like. So I think I could change something about what I like if I change one important thing about my country. 

 When I was 15 years old, I am fascinated in math. And until now, I like math. I think that I could like math in future. I think that the person who enjoys works would be succeed. Thus I would change something in mathematics. 

 Also, I tried to be good at mathematics. When I was in middle school, I had a complex which I am not good a math. But I tried hard to study math and solve much more problems than other students. In this process, I was going to enjoy it. So I could get the first grade in my highschool!

 In addition, I have good experiences. In my highschool, I studied with my friend about math and discuss each other several times. It was so helpful for me understanding math.

Therefore, the most important thing I would like to change is making my country become a developed country, especially in scientific. In a developed country, there are many of modern machines that help people's life, make them work easier, have a happy life and treat diseases. 

First, in algriculture with up-to-date technic, people can grow more rice, vegetables, fruits, etc. with less physical work. In addition, the product will be fresher, higher quanlity and cheaper, the products can be exported to foreign countries. People in my country still have to grow rice, watering vegetables and trees by their hands. That waste a lot of physical effort. 

Second, morden machine can help doctors diagnose diseases earlier, somes even can treat specific diseases without drugs. Nowaday, there are more and more new diseases. Lack of new technic leads to late of diagnosing and finding treatment. COVID 19 is a dangerous disease that make lots of people die and we need vacine for treatment. Obviously, we can not figure out the right vacine without developed scientific.

Finally, good machines can help protect our border from instruders both on land and sea. Absolutely, war machine is not good if we use it in wrong purpose, making war with other countries. However, they are really neccessary to defense the country from being attacked by the others. The more powerful and modern weapons, the higher security that the country can get. Once people in a country being safe, they can live a happy life and work effectively.

There are much more good things that we can have with a developed scientific. Therefore, I really want to develop my country firstly on this field."	3.5	3.0	2.5	9.0
745	You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"The problem of dormitory is one of the important things to university students. And, most of dormitory problems are caused by other people in dormitory rooms. Thus, it is the big issue to choose between having the university assign a student and choosing their own roommate. Although some people argue that pairing unknown roommate is better to students, my argument is that student should choose their roommate. There are three reasons in terms of stress because of uncertainty and development.
 First,  having university assign a student makes another student feel stress. There are three things that human beings should have, also known as clothes, food, and house. It means house that is place to sleep is important to human beings. So, if student's roommate is uncertain, that fact affects student's mental. All people are different. It takes many time to fit student's life pattern with their roommate for example food, language, and sleeping. Taking this time at every semester is waste of time. 
 Despite the above reason, some people said that new roommates is better because receiving new experiences is important to university students. However, university already give students new experiences through the lectures, activities, laboratories, and even clubs. Students always face with new situations. It makes students better and more creative, but this environment is quite stressful to students. Then, students should have their own place to feel comfortable and calm. That is dormitory. If students feel uncomfortable at the dorm, students' abilities will decrease.
 Because of two reasons, it is better to give the choice right to select their own roommate. University represents the freedom and responsibility. However, making forced roommate is giving students only responsibility except for freedom.  University should be the place of freedom at every areas even the dormitory."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0
2066	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" I think every sports is good hobby for all of college students.
 It’s because activity sports like soccer, basketball, table tennis and so on are effective at enhancing our health and for side effect, we can use our energy so that we can sleep at early night. That is, if I drank a cup of coffee to get my concentration and do a work out with my hobby, I don’t have to worry about the early sleep. When the time’s close to midnight, I get too exhausted to stay awake.
 Second, it’s also really effective at conserving my body’s posture. I felt this is true during my work out-days. Almost 6 months from January to July, I have done the work out 5 hours a week. And I felt my body’s posture is well-positioned. I think this is because the muscles of my body is get bigger and my bones next to muscle are also well-positioned. Because of this chain effect, I can get focused on my posture even in working or studying. So If I have a hobby in sports, I can expect I can get this useful and helpful side effect.
 Lastly, if I have any sports hobby, I am able to attend the sports club. In sports club, of course we can easily get the person who want to play sports games with me. And playing with club members, we can even expect the friendship with members. I think this is really good side effect because I attended here to have fun with sports game, but there’s other entertainment by getting close with club members. 
 For this three reasons, having hobby of sports is very good choice in college. I heard that, in germany, about 70% of adult have there own sports club and it found that doing sports is helpful of enhancing work efficiency and friendship. Then, why don’t you get any sports for your hobby? Thank you for your reading."	2.5	1.5	2.0	6.0
998	Lifestyle: Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer	"I prefer doing only what I already do well to trying new things and taking risks. Because if I did not succeed in doing new things, then my proud would became lower and lower. For people, an proud is very important in order to live their life, since it makes their performance of everything they do better. If they lose it, then they may do not well on their work. For example, let's suppose I took a course and I got A0. Then next semester, I took a challenging course and I got B0. Then I would lose proud, so in the next semester, I would not do well as I did in the first semester.

Nowadays, many people do bitcoin in order to earn money. They always have to take risks. Nevertheless, Most of them lose their money. This shows that challenging is like an casino game, which only depends on their luck. If they study bitcoin a lot, then they may be do well respectively, but it still depends on their luck. If they only depend their luck when they do bitcoin, they may lose a lot of money, or even lose all of their money, or have to get a help of loan. Challenging is very dangerous, in this point of view.

Also, people naturally prefer stablity to challenging, according to many research results. It is their natural property. When we choose our job, we tend to choose what we can do well instead of what we like to do. It's because what we can do well makes stable money to live our life. Passion is also important, but only passion without ability makes people poor in majority of cases. Thus, we can figure out that most people think that stablity is the most important value in their life.

For instance, for who likes science and math, doctor is very excellent job, in comparison to researcher or scientist. Do you think that it is because all of them like doctor's job? The answer is definitely No. They may really like do experiment, and do research. However, doctor earns a lot of money and it makes their life stable. This shows most people prefer stablity very much. Similarly, public work employee is one of the very popular jobs in Korea past 25 years.

For the reasons I stated above, we can realize that doing only what we already do well is way better than trying new things and taking risks."	3.0	2.5	3.0	
180	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Did you knew that KAIST(Korea Advanced Institution of Science and Technology) requires all kinds of science and math such as biology, chemistry, and linear algebra as a primary courses for freshmen? Not only KAIST, but also many university in Korea used to demand their student to study many subjects as many as they can. According to these examples, I think university that requires their students to take various courses is better than others. Then, why universities that courage students to deal with many subjects are better?
       First of all, world which we are living in has multiple complex problems. Unlike prior world, human kinds are facing difficult issues like global warming or nuclear issues. Theses kind of problems cannot be solved without various perspective and approches. This means that specialist who is only specialized in one subject cannot solve complex problems or misled easily. Thus, it should be better to require students to face various subjects and experience enormous kinds of problem within.
       Moreover, dealing with many subjects can be helpful for improving student's insight. Even if two different subjects are dealing with same problem, each subject's goals and approches has lots of difference. For example, thermodynamics in physics is used to predict how universe will change in the future. But, thermodynamics in chemistry is used to estimate whether this reaction is spontaneous. Eventually, when we study various subjects which taught us many kinds of techniques to solve problems, it will improve our insight toward world.
      In short, studying various courses and subjects can make us live well in world with complex problems and give us brilliant insights. Therefore, university which gives students a oppertunnity to deal with various subjects is better than university which requires students to be specialized."	3.5	4.0	4.0	11.5
2128	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Adavantages of Watich Online Video lectures
        Since the first semester of 2020, people started online lectures because of the global infectious disease COVID-19.  Therefore, students watched lecture videos instead of going live lectures. People say online lecutres have some disadvantages for studying. Of course, it is true, but many students said there are more advantages than disadvantges when we watch online video lectures. There are two big advantages of watching online video lectures vesus viewing live lectures in a traditional class room.
        First, student can watch the lecture anywhere and anytime they want. When students go to the classroom and view live lectures in there, they feel its boring and tired. If the lecture is scheduled in 9 am, then student should wake up before 8 am to prepare. On the other hand, students don’t have to wake up early and go to the classroom in online lectures. They can watch the lecture in dormitorty, home, or anywhere they want. Also if the lecture is recorded video and given to students, then they can watch the same lecture at 9 pm, not 9 am. It means that students can watch the lecture when they want. It is a very big advantage.
        Second, students can watch the lecture again. When students go to the classroom and view live lectures, they cannot watch it again. Therefore, if you don’t pay attention for a moment, you can’t hear what professor said again. On the other hand, since the many online lecture are given as a video, students can watch it again. If they missed something in lecture. It is very big advantage because if we can watch it again and find some missing things, it helps students to study hard and helps not to miss the assignments.
        To sum up, Online video lectures have two big advantages versus viewing live lecture in classroom. Since, the lectures are given as the video and students don’t have to go to the classroom, they can watch the lectures anywhere and anytime they want. Also, because lectures are given as video, students can watch the lecture again. It helps students to find some missing things and study hard. As this essay shows, watching online video lectures have many advantages versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom. "	4.0	4.0	3.5	11.5
1324	In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Did you see any movie that tell you what is friend? I saw many, and especially one movie that shows real friendship of three friends made me surprised. After I saw that movie, I believe the qualities of a real good friend are 'honest', 'belief', and 'to believe each other'.

First quality is honest, but actually honest don't contain the meaning of 'do not lie'. Let's suppose that One man in hard situation tell ""Everything goes well!"" to his friend, then think about it. He would say that for some reasons such like ""I don't want him to know my situation, because he would worry it"". Honest that I want to tell you means 'to tell his friend for friend'. The relation between friends who truely think for each other is strong.

Secone quality is belief. To become real friend, he(or she) should have belief, because person who doesn't have belief easily change his(or her) own thinking. I call that kind of people 'one drop of water in the ocean.'. When wind blows, water goes and back with the direction of wind without its own thinking. This relation that 'A goes and B traces' will easily be broken.

Last one is 'to believe each other'. Everyone may think it when writing this essay. We all know the importance of it, so I would not say much about it. Just I want to tell you is 'this quality tells whether relation between people exist'. I strongly believe 'To believe' is the first step when people meet each other and get relationship.

I choose this three, because I think the qualities of good friend mean the 'long and deep relation'. If we have real good friends, we will meet them for long time. 'To believe' makes the first step to be good friend, 'Belief' makes them fun and think other way, and 'Honest' feel their friends good. T"	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5

"  I want to change education system in my country, Korea. Few years ago, I was under in high school in Korea. I felt there are so many unnecessary things in education course. In my opinion, student should choose subjects like university. There are several reasons why I want to change education system.
  First, There are too many subjects.  When student in middle school, student learn fundermental things. however, student learn specific things in high school.  Threre are some disadvantage. For example, some student don't want to learn math. Because, they don't need too specific mathmetical knowleage and mathmetical idea. If student can choose subject, this student may not learn math, and learn more useful subject for them.
  Second, student can learn deeper. For example, math education course 's volume in high school is decreaing  becase of class time issue. If student can choose subject, student who want to learn math may choose many math courses, and they can learn deeper. Korea's math course teach too finite area. It is also in other high school education couse.
 Third,  It can decrease competition. Nowdays, knowleage is not important. For example, In economic class in high school, economic knowleage is not important. That is only memorized text need for test score. Most of student don't have any interest in meaing of text. If student can choose subject, diversity of subject will increase. So, student can focus on their interesting subject. In my opnion, student may feel less stress becasue that subject is not only for competiton.
  For these reasons, if I could change one important thing about my country, I would change education system. It can make Korea students happy and fun high school."	3.0	3.5	3.0	9.5
1575	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	I think worst thing of my country is too much competing. Furthermore, reason of this phenomenon is that there are many things which universities want. So, I want to change things that universities order. These days, they make high school students write individual introduction paper 3500 letters and participate many museum and, study hard to the top while they are in school. But, this is so busy that many high school students choose dying. As we know, university students are busy but I don't think high school students don't need to be busy. So, I want to remove individual introduction paper because it is not important. If you want to estimate students, see the school life record paper not individual introduction paper. For example, KAIST pass three students who copy other people's introduction paper. Other example is DGIST. In my high school students write only 2500 letters but university order 3500 letters. However the result is pass so many students who are in my school think individual introduction paper is garbage one. To sum up, individual introduction paper is trash so I want eliminate this, and this will decrease high school students' concern.	2.5	2.5	3.0	8.0
2141	What are the advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class? give specific reasons and details to support your opinion	"At the most serious COVID-19 period, all classes in the world were opened online. According to this, students are using laptop or tablet in class. I think there are  many advantages of using these not only in online class, but also in offline class.
  First, students can search their all of questions in the class immediately. Including me, many students can't understand all of the class, but there are few questions in class. I think the reason is that students think their questions are too easy and they think all students can't give their all of questions during the class time. However, each student can search their own questions on the internet with tablet or labtop. Then, professor can use class time full and all students can solve their lots of questions.
  Second, students can write and save their memo during class safely. Some students make memo for everyday class and use them on individual studying. Suppose that they make it on paper note, then it can be lost, wet, torn easily if the student don't care them everytime. However, if they make it on tablet or labtop, they can get away from managing the papers. They can clear the files with folder system, and freely use it when they individually study.
  Third, Students can move lightly. They have several classes everyday, then they have to carry their thick textbooks. If several classes are continued right away, then students have to run to next classroom with their heavy bags. However, only one tablet or labtop can be instead of the heavy bag. they can save the thick textbooks without additional weight.
  I wrote three advantages of using tablet or labtop in class. It is very helpful for students' comfortable campus life. There will be many advantages for professors too. And I think nobody can't stop this technologically changing life. By developing technology continuously, people will use it to make more efficient and comfortable life."	3.0	3.0	3.0	9.0
299	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are many students in KAIST who think between taking classes in many subjects for fusion and specializing in one subject for getting strength in one field. I think that specializing in one subject is better than taking classes in many subjects. There are three reasons for my opinion.

First of all, if we take classes in many subjects, we cannot have a lower specialty in one field. For example, in the Department of Materials Science & Engineering, all students are taught about the introduction of chemistry, physics, and biology. It may seem good, but many students can't get depth knowledge about any one field of science. So, it eventually can make students lose their force to perform strong studies, and lose at competing among other science major students.

Moreover, specializing in even one subject is very hard for university students. According to my lab professor, there are many students to do double major for achieving fusion between two major. However, he said that there are also many students that miss their core major subject since they are so busy to take other major classes to get a title of double major. So, he advised that concentrating on one subject is much better than taking classes in many subjects. And in his empirical, it is said that students who study one subject in depth usually do better performance in graduate school.

Finally, students who specialize in one subject can get a better opportunity in the field of industry. Compared to the students who take classes in many subjects, they have a bigger possibility to solve an industrial problem because they have a higher understanding of one field. So, they will catch more opportunity to revise an industrial problem.

For these reasons, I think that specializing in one subject has more strength than taking classes in many subjects. Although the students who specialize in one subject may be hard to fusion two subjects, I think that the fusion of the two subjects is possible for students who already specialize in one field. So, as I mentioned before, specializing in one subject is better."	3.5	4.0	3.5	11.0
1630	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	There are some reasons why i prefer online lecture. The biggest benefit is that i can listen to it wherever i want. Instead of moving busy from place to place to attend the class, all we need is just to turn on the laptop and watch the video. Due to that i can save lot of time everyday. And those saved time will be helpful in many ways. Second. We can watch lecture video again and again until i got to understand it. In offline lecture, the only way to remember the content of it was to write a note. But now I can just watch the lecture again. That is really precious. Still there are few disadvantages, but online lecture have great benefits too. I like it.	2.5	2.0	2.0	6.5
421	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" I believe that university students should attend classes. There are 3 reasons for my opinion. 

First, when you attend classes, you can interact with professors. I think what we can learn from class is not just knowledges but also interaction with professors and wisdom from professors. I am happy to listen to professor's experience and many lessons. 

Second, we can focus more deeply. In my case, when I study alone, I can't focus on for long time. I often use my smartphone. However, when I took classes, I just listened to professors and I could learn fast and efficiently.

Last, communication with friends is very important. Nowadays, COVID-19 is becoming more and more serious issues. Before that event, we can go to school, join a club and meet many friends. In college, we can highly develop our communcation skills through many clubs or festivals etc,,,,,,,,. However, now we could not meet our friends offline. Attending class is one of a way to communicate with many people. 

Therefore I think it is really important to force students attend classes. Although some people don't agree with me, I think there are so many advantages when students take classes."	3.0	3.5	3.5	10.0
529	Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"I prefer to spend time with one or two close friends for several reasons.
 One is that it is hard  for me to communicate with person that doesn't have same interests. People often talk about where they did go on weekend, or delicious liquors, or games that are popular, such like that. But I'm mainly interested in quite strange things, such as school study, or games that isn't popular, etc. So, it is hard to find  people has same interests with me, so when I spend time with friends, I find a few of friends that have same interests with me; therefore, I spend time with a few friends.
 The second reason is that I feel uncomfortable when many people focus on me. This is my character from when I was a child. In lunch time at school, I spent time in classroom or libraries, when others play soccer in playground. I merely experienced to spend time with many friends, so It is hard to stay with many people for me.
 At last, I don't have many friends. As mentioned before, I like to stay alone and focus on what I'm really interested, so I don't have enough time to make friends. So I have a small number of friends; therefore I hang out with small number of friends.
 In summary, I like to spend time with a small number of friends that have same interests with me."	1.5	2.0	2.5	6.0
101	Government: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.    	"Governments Should Spend More on Public Transportations

Recently, cities are being more and more bigger and complicated. People tend to like the cities because the cities have more infra than the countryside. This phenomena is noticeable for the big cities; for example, Seoul, New York, and Beijing are complicated. Therefore, the traffic problems are appearing in those countries which have big cities, and there is two big different views. Although some say governments should spend more money on the roads and highways, I would say public transportation is more important in terms of three points.
First of all, the population is growing in world-wide. Human beings have improved agriculture methods and medical knowledges, and this makes the population pop-up from the 100 million to the 700 million. Increasing so fast, human beings are gathering up together and make the big city. The city with a huge population have also a big area, so people needs transportation to move on. Therefore, the government should build more public transportation to solve this.
The following reason for the population problem is traffic problem. In these days, almost every families have their own cars. Without the public transportations, they definitely ride their vehicles when they are going shopping or going to work. This induces a terrible traffic jam during every morning and evening. However, If there are enough public transports, less cars go out to the roads and less traffic jam will be happened.
The opponents will insist that building more roads can solve those problems, but it is not. To increase the amount of the roads and highways, some space will be needed. However, the big cities have already too much roads and buildings to make more roads and highways. Building more roads in these cities should contain destruction of buildings or expanding the city, and this makes just more complicated city and traffic jam. On the other hand, improving public transportation does not need any expansion. Thus, more effective and economical.
To summarize, governments should spend money on improving public transport. Three reasons are given for this, even if some says roads and highways are more important. Improving public transport is necessary in terms of population, traffic, and spacing, and this will improve the city life, too."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
760	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I prefer to study together for two reasons. First, classmates would encourage me when I want to give up and rest. Last year, I did a group study for general physics course. However, because I made my appointments, I could stick to my homework and make it.
The other reason is that one can be more creative. When I face a difficult problem, I can get a hint from others. By sharing various opinions and perspectives, one can get an wide angle of thinking. I studied more effectively when I did together.
I respect students who study alone as well. But from my experience, It is better to study with other students."	1.0	1.0	1.5	3.5

I thinks that BTS, the most famous K-pop artist, is great example in tinfluence people's behatviorhat case. I think videos 


First of all, Movies and TV Program are combined the society. 
Producer who make movies and his or her co-worker should analyse about what is popular and funny in people's mind. So people get fun from that movies,
Second, video can give more stimulation than other material.
More than 60 years ago, the only device that can get informations in korea is radio. radio sends sound and people hear that. In this case, people only use thier ears. However, In this time, videos are main tools that spread informations. During COVID-19 pandemic, video flatform such as youtube, Netflix and wavve etc can fastest grow and we see a movie in that flatform. This fact give some idea that Movies and TV program can create cultural power for people, too.
Last reason, popular makes wave in culture.
Anyone can make culture wave for thier own's benefit. If people don't like specific culture, culture is destroy in that time. We already know great example in China. China goverment still tried to chinese culture spread in many country like K-pop, but they get failure.

2078	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Students in college could have multiple good hobbies. For hobbies to be considered good they should either aid in self development or help the society in some way. For college students good hobbies could mainly be classified into three groups hobbies in research, hobbies in clubs and hobbies in academics. 
           In hobbies for research, students could participate in a lab.s under the guidance of a professor. The students can either be part of the experiment or be part of the researchers. Being part of the experiment is simple students will be asked to follow certain procedures depending on the guidlines of the lab. they are participating in. For example, If the expeiment is taking place in biology lab. where the researchers are measuring EEG, students will be asked to remove their jewlery and take a sit on a chair and relax while the reseachers measure stundents brain wave activities. On the other hand if students are a part of the resarch, they will work hand in hand with the professor conducting experiments. For example, If the research is taking place in computer science lab. students will be asked to develop software that gives a desired output. The students will then look into the ""open source"" and find codes that might be usefull in their reseach, they will then modify the code and subject it to test cases until they get the desired output.
          In hobbies in clubs, students usually apply for the clubs that they are passionate about.  After the application process is over the club leaders hand pick students that they think showed the most passion among the people who applied. After this process is over the students usually work on group activites with the club members. For example if a student has applied and is accepeted in the music club, he/she will have the chance to sing with the club members and have a good time. In addition he/she could have the chance to perform to the whole campus.
          In hobbies in academics, students usually spend their time mainly in libraries. their dorms or with professors, either studying for or asking questions about the courses. For example, a student who is currently taking the physics course could watch a youtube video in his dorm about how to caluclate the speed of light.
          In conclusion, good hobbies are hobbies that help in either self development or help the society in some way. In college good hobbies can be mainly classified into three main groups hobbies in research which help students understand how to work hand in hand with professors and undestand how to conduct experiments, hobbies in clubs which help students explore their passion and have the chance to show thier passion to the world,and hobbies in academics which help the students understand more about the courses."	4.0	4.0	3.5	11.5

2074	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Recently, COVID-19 spreaded all over world, and people had to stay at home for a long time. To spend thier time, people tried to find new hobbies or works such as starting 1-person broadcasts, home training, etc. Also collegue students started to find their new hobby as their colleges decided to have online-courses not to attend physically to their collegues, and have a lot of free time at home. I also suffered that problems and tried to find new activities not to be bored. And from now on, I'm going to recommend several hobbies that colleage students can enjoy easily.

  First, making some cocktails at home is one of good hobbeis for college students. Especially for freshmen of collegue, most of them have a lot of interesting on drinking but their were only few moments to try them. So I recommend you to try some cocktails at home. There are two reasons why I recommend it. First, we can enjoy drinking without go outside or hanging with friends which mean that we can keep government's regulations to prevent COVID-19. Second, since online video flatforms are activated we can easily find some guidelines to start making cocktails. But what we have not to forget is that we have to focus on ""Making"", not ""Drinking"". Too much drinks induce health problems, just enjoy making cocktails and fresh experiences.
  Second, playing musical instruments can be one of good hobbies for college students. People think that all musical instruments are expensive and hard to start it without teachers or guide books. In fact, hurdles to start new instruments is being lower then past. We can easily learn them from Youtube platform, 101 Classes which is website that we can learn various hobbies or techniques such as playing musical instruments, drawing, programming and etc. So why I recomment playing musical instruments? We can calm down and get rid of some stresses playing beautiful melodies. Of course that it would be hard at first. For my case, every vacations I try to learn new instruments to find new experiences and feelings. Not every process of learning is fun and excited, but after practiced some basic skills I could play several songs what I wanted to play. So if you keep making efforts, you will start to enjoy them soon.

  At first peroid of the pandemic, governments demanded residents to keep social distancing, so many educational organizations were busy to construct online-classes system and rescheduled school enducation plans. But these days, almost every systems are well organized using various programs and platforms, also companies started to support online-classes for general people who want to find their new hobbies. To sum up, you can consider making cocktails or playing new musical instruments, also you may use online-courses sites to find new hobbies. I hope you to find interesting hobbies or studying to step-up your abillities."	4.0	3.5	3.0	10.5
2271	If you could change one important aspect about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In korea their is good high- speed railway service that helps you move form one city to other in really short time. I also like to use railway services whenever i have to go to other big citys like seoul of Busan. This service help lot of students, office workers who has word on other city and people who are traviling.  Their are two kind of high speed trains in Korea, the KTX and SRT.  KTX is a train that is owned by korail and SRT is owned by SR. I recently got to know that their is problem with this two companys through news and i think these two companys should become one company.
 To find out why, we have to know why SR started their bussiness. SR started their bussiness in order to make a competition in railway service to make the service quality good. So SRT tickets are 10% cheaper than KTX tickets and many people said the competetion allow people to use hign speed train more cheaper. This seems like a good aspect of competetion. But it is not a fair competition. We have to know that many of the SRT trains are lented to SR by Korail in a very cheap price. Plus Korail does everything to keep the train working. They check the rail conditions, check the train and fix it if there is any problem and they sell ticket for SR. It seems weird. The important thing is that Korail in  a company that runs by the government. It means that our tax are used in this work and SR's profit is going to their company's workers. It is not fair to help one company useing our tax.
 Competitions between KTX and SRT is not a fair competition. In seoul their are two stations that the high-speed trains stop. Seoul station and Sewso station.  KTX only stop at Seoul station and SRT only stop at Sewso station. costumer have to use different trains due to their final destination in seoul. It is ok if SRT goes on every high speed railway but SRT only run on high profit railways so their can be people having inconvience.
 For these reasons I want to change the railway companys to one company that is runed by government so that many people can use the railway service more reaonably and to stop our tax being wasted."	2.5	3.0	3.0	8.5
1425	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In KAIST, majority of students may have some experiences that they order some food for there lunch or dinner by delivery. Because of the policy of KAIST, the delivery motorcycles cannot come in to our campus. Only delivery cars can come in to our campus and can deliver directly to our dormitory. This policy is hard to understand why school maintains this old policy. I would like to change this policy for us. There are 3 reasons why we can change this policy.

  First of all, because of this policy, it is hard to eat many kind of foods easily. Almost all of restaurants do not use car for their delivery. Thus if we order that foods, we have to walk about 15 minutes to main enterance or small enterance to take the ordered foods. This reduces the positive point of deliver. Many student us delivery because it is convinience. Thus they avoid these restaurants and find the another stores which support deliver to domitary. This limits the number of stores that we can order foods. According to our student association, 80% of students of KAIST cannot understand this policy and they think this policy should be deleted. For welfare for KAIST students, this policy should be changed.

  Second, the delivery bike is not that dangerous. School decides to maintain this policy because delivery bike is very dangeous to students. But the bike is not that much dangerous. One of my friend Junhyuk who has own bike said, ""bike is not that dangerous as much as school thinks."" He continued, ""All bike drivers reduce their speed in campus because there are a lot of students and speed bumps in campus. I can't understand school policy."" Also, in fact, there were no accidents in 2 years by the motorcycle in KAIST campus. Thus deleteing this school policy does not make problem as delivery bikes are not very dangerous. 

  Finally, the reason that school said does not support their decision. school said that they decide to maintain this policy because this is tradition of KAIST and It is hard to control the delivery bike as our campus is too big. This policy cannot be the tradition of the university. This policy violates students right which is the freedom of decision. Something that violates the student right cannot be the tradition. Also, the delivery bikes can be controled. The Seoul National University has bigger campus than KAIST. However, they are controlling the delivery bikes and they have no accident by them. Therefore, we can know that we also can control the delivery bikes. Two supports of school doesn't have the logic. Thus we don't have any reason to maintain this bad policy. 

  Because of the policy that the delivery bikes cannot get in to the campus, students can order to only few stores for their convenience. Also the delivery bikes are not that dangerous. Furthurmore, the evidences of schools to prevent delivery bikes do not have any logics. In conclusion, we have to change this policy for many people. "	4.5	4.5	4.0	13.0
411	University:Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"Importance of Attendance in University

In my university, almost every classes require students to attend class, but some classes are not. Also, there are students who think attendance is meaningless. I think university students should be required to attend class. There are three reasons.

 First of all, students pay tuition fee, and it is quite expensive. Much of tuition fee is for listening to class of professor. However if students do not attend the class, they are paying for nothing. Not attending class is throw the money on the floor. 

 Secondly, Attending class is helpful to students studying. Becauase the contents of major textbook is hard and very large in quantity, it is hard to study everything alone. With professors help, students are able to know the points of the class and it will reduce the time they study.  Also, It is possible to ask questions to professor directly. It will help the students improve their knowledge. 

 Lastly, attending class is the way to interact with professor. If there is no one attending class, the professor would be lonely and lose motivation to make a better class. And it can be lead to downgrade the quality of class. Attending class and interacting with professor is good for improve class quality, and it also helps share bright energy among students and professors. 

 To sum up, Attending class has many brighter side than not attending class, and it has to be required."	3.0	3.0	3.0	9.0

"Since I am a freshman in university, I have a lots of assignments and test, so there is no time to travel. Nevertheless, I have time to go trip when the semaster ends and I can imagine when this time comes. If I have the oppertunity to go travel a foriegn country, altough all countries in the world are great, I feel that I will visit china.
First of all, chinese culture is similar to Korea. Since china and korea is adjusted for a long time, both countries share their culture, and this simimarity makes me feel comfortable when I visit a strange place. 
In addition to the cultural similarity, I want to visit china because of the developed food cultue. Chinese food is one of the most common food in the world. There are a lot of chinese restautant in global and most people knows the chinese.  Furthermore, since I like to enjoy new foods, I want to go to china and exprience the chinese food culture.
Finally, one of the important reason why I want to go china is that I haven't go to there before. I think the purpose of travel is experiencing new, so I want to go somewhere I have never visited, and china is one of them. Thus, I want to go there and exprience new culture by visiting the historical places.
In short, china is a good place for me to travel because of the similarity of culture and the develpoed eatingculture. Moreover, I have never been china. For this reason, if I have a oppertunity to travel fo two weeks, I will go to china and enjoy lots of chinese culture: foods and historical places."	3.0	3.0	3.0	9.0
1676	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"For many students, KAIST is one of the universities that everyone want to study in. Almost every people think KAIST is one of the best universities in Korea. And I also think it is true. Unfortunately, however the university is good, there exists not good things in there. I think it is in our educational system . If I can change one thing is KAIST, I'll change some part of it. I will make student more creative and smarter for our future. This do not means studying science and technology more hard. I mean study about world. I'll explain how and why I want to change educational system.
    First, KAIST have to teach society for students. Science technology comes from people's uncomfortable things. We develop fans because it's too hot in summer, we developed robots because we don't want to work hard. There are many problems like that in our society. And its answer is technology. To know about these problems that people have, we should know society. But in KAIST, many people don't know about society. Reading newspapers, watching TV news programs, to go out of KAIST and meet lots of people are such a good way to know society. But many students are stalling in KAIST and just study science and technology. I think studying society is very important. And KAIST should know this.
    Second, KAIST have to make students read more books. There are not bad books. Reading comic books, fantasy novel is not a problem. When you read comic books, creativity grows. When you read novel, you can know other people's life. We know almost every successful people read many books, even if he or she works at scientific company. If we meet someone at street and ask about reading books, almost everyone will reply that reading books is important. But many people do not read books. I think this is big problem. For more creative KAIST, we should read many books.
    To summarize, I want to change some part of educational system. I explained about teaching society and reading books. But it is not enough. There are many things, not in science or technology parts, we should study. If we want KAIST to be better and make KAIST best university in world, we should focus on these parts too."	4.0	3.5	4.0	11.5
343	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Over the past few years, there are much controversy about whether computers have made life easier or more stressful. Some people claim that computer have made computers have made life more complex because modern people should understand how computers work. However, in my opinion, computers have made life more convenient for 3 reasons below. 
   First, computers replace human labor. In the past, people calculated all things such as costs and data by their hands. On the contrary, people do not have to treat simple work, so computers have made life more convenient. People who say computers have made life more complex argue that computers can make fatal error. However, computers are much faster and more sophisticated than humans. 
   Second, computers allow communication with people easier. Nowadays, almost of people have social network service account. They can communicate much more easily through social network service than in the past. Opponents argue that social network service reduces people's direct contact. However, it is true that contact with people has increased significantly compared to the past. Therefore, people can maintain a closer relationship with each other.
   Third, computers provide a large amount of information. Nowadays, people can easily get information at any time by the Internet. Some opponents argue that people may not be able to make decisions easily based on too much information. However, it is good enough if people select the information well.
   In conclusion, computers replace human labor, allow communication with people easier and provide a large amount of information. Therefore, the argument that computers have made life easier and more convenient can be persuasive."	4.5	4.0	3.5	12.0

Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.        	"Everyone knows Neil Armstrong who goes to the moon for the first time. At that time, it is a big issue that humans go to the moon for the first time, and now, many countries try to go to Mars which is the new target. To progress this project, there a lot of money is needed; besides, governments only can support money. Spending as much money as possible exploring outer space is necessary and there are three main reasons. 
First, the result of research about outer space will be precious property to the country. In the past, people could not think people can talk with people who leave far; however, now people can do this through science development. Science technology becomes an important resource for the country now. Just like this, in the future, technology about going to the other planets or moon may be strong points to the country, and that country may be a strong country in the world. 
Second, there is an honor to the country that makes the first result of space. These days all of the students in the world learn that American people went to the moon for the first time. Many media such as movie and books says about this. Like this, if one country success to go to the other planet in the future, all of the people in the world know about this. This is honor to the country and this honor will be a strong point to the economy and society because of the global period.
Other people can think governments can save their country a person with this money. However, if governments think the present only, that country will go to the behind other countries. Technology about another planet is a high technology and this will be competitiveness with the country. The country will be hard when only other countries get high technology because they have to pay to get learn their thechnology."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0

Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"To achieve success in life, there are two ways: taking risks or chances and careful planning. Both methods have their pros and cons, but there is no way to return when the taking risk is ruined. Therefore, they can only achieve success in their life with careful planning.
First of all, achieving success requires a sophisticated process. Achieving success takes a long time. Therefore, with careful planning, people do not lose their way. In other words, without careful planning, it is very hard to concentrate on their goals. If people want to achieve success, they need to plan carefully.
In addition, people can not achieve success alone. In the process to achieve success, they need courage from families and friends. Therefore, they should explain how to achieve their success with accurate and careful planning. Through this, they can persuade families and friends, also at the same time they can remind their goal. It is a very important process to achieve success effectively.
Some people might say that success in life comes from taking risks or chances, but it is not true. It is very hard, but if someone achieves success by taking risks they could not achieve success anymore. This is only a very short section, and taking risks to achieve success is very risky when you look at life as a whole. In other words, if taking risks but failed, people can not recover and stand up.

917	Tech: Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"It is debatable whether computers have made life more complex and stressful. This is intriguing question because the opinion concerning this issue can be different depending on people's perspectives. However, in my opinion, I strongly disagree with the statement. This is because computers supply more information and  do complex work process.
     First of all, we can get a lot of information by computers. What I mean is that, people cannot know all information such as how to make cake, how to solve math problem and so on. If we do not have computer, we find people who know information or books. Using computer, we find information very easily, just one click. For example, when I was in high school,  I lived in dorm. When I changed the dorm, new dorm's bath room is very dirty. I wanted to clean bathroom but it is very hard to remove all dirty thing. However, using computer, I could find information how to clean efficiently. Through this experience, I realized that computer makes life easier and more convenient. Hence,  this proves that  computers have made people life easier.
     Second, computer is the best machine to do complex work process because it can solve difficult problem during very short time. To be specific, excel solve difficult problems and show that, as a result, we can easily organize charts. People can save time to solve problems and do not have to consider how to solve it. For example, I did graduate project in last semester. There are a lot of data and equation. If I cannot use excel, I spent a lot of time to solve the equation and organized charts. However, using excel program, I can save a lot of time and one format can  apply all data. This is a good example to show that computer makes life better. Therefore, this shows that people life can be easier by using computers.
     In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers make people life better. All things considered, it is my belief that my argument regarding this topic has been effectively and precisely delivered with the reasons mentioned above."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
1518	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  Is there a friend who went studying abroad around you? It is called studying abroad when a student goes to a different country than his or her own country. In most cases, student goes to college abroad, but sometimes from middle school or high school to study abroad. I also saw many friends who choose to study aborad while living in school for 12 years until this year. Based on the stories of my friends, I thought about why people go studying abroad.
  First of all, the most common case is going to learn a language. English and Chinese are the most commonly used lanfuages in the world, so there are many advantages to know English or Chinese well. When learning a language, living in a native language country is the  best way to learn it naturally. So there are students who go th Australia, New Zealand, the United States to learn English, China to learn Chinese, and Singapore to learn both. Like this, there are many students choose to study abroad for their fluent foreign language skills.
Secondly, there are somes casees that going a studying abroad for college. in this case, many students go abroad to study when they are young. And it can be divided two categories of going to foreign and domestic universities. Let's first consider the case of going to a foriegn uiniversity. KAIST and Seoul National University,is the best universities in Korea, but they are ranked among the top 30~50 in the world. Therefore, in order to go to a university that is better than the university in Korea, students are going to studying abroad in that country and entering the foreign university. ,Before we think about the case of going to a domestic university, we have to know that there is a foreign admission system in our country. This is typical of foreigners or students who graduated from foreign schools taking entrance exams, and the competition rate is often lower than that of general admission. Thus, to easily enter a top-ranked university in Korea, there are cases where students graduate from a foreign school."	3.5	4.5	4.0	12.0
530	Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"I prefer to spend time with a large number of friends, not with one or two friends because of 3 reasons.

First, larger group can make more communication. I prefers to talk a lot when I meet friends, but it is hard to do when I meet one or two friends because there is less topics to talk. However, when I meet lots of friends in one place, each person has their own topics to talk so there are many topics to talk together as a result. That means it is better to join a larger group for a talk.

Second, we can do or choose more activities to do together. When I met one or two friends, we always go to PC-room or coin garaoke. It's because other activities are hard to enjoy by 2 or 3 person. However, I can play games that more than 4 people is needed, go to garaoke that is large, play board games that needs many people, and etc when I met many friends. Also, there are more choices of restaurant when I met more friends. As a summary, more choices are added when I met more friends. So it is better to meet more friends.

Lastly, I prefers a larger group because it is easy to meet with one  or two friends, but hard to meet with a large group. Each person has their own schedule, so it is hard to meet all friends in one day. However, meeting one or two friends is not so hard because we only need to consider one or two schedules. So if there's a chance to meet many friends, I would choose larger groups to meet.

Because of these reasons, I prefer to spend time with a large number of friends than one or two close friends. Sadly, it is impossible to meet a large number of friends in now days, so I hope the pandemic ends soon."	3.5	4.0	3.5	11.0
1727	If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"     Have you ever lived in a city under development? I'm living a town under development, Maseok. Most of people think that living in a city under development will have a lot of new infrastructure and be comfortable. But in reality, it is not ture. The subway is far away, and there are not many buses going to Seoul, and there are only small restaurants and cafes nearby. Among these problems, I want to suggest most important thing to be changed with several reasons. It is infrastructure. Let's findout some reasons.

      First, there's nothing to play with. There are many good places to take a walk, such as parks and rivers, but it is hard to find movie theaters and cafes. There is disadvantage that it is difficult to access book cafes or various entertainment activities, which are recently popular. Even paks and rivers that currently exist are only used for walks becuase of Covid - 19. Since there is nothing to play like this, students from nearby middle and high schools can see them play near the station by taking the bus to play after class. Therefore, more diverse infrastructure is needed.

     Second, It's hard to deliver. As Covid - 19 continues these days, the number of people ordering delivery has increased significantly. I'm one of them, and my house is quite far from the stroe I want to deliver. Therefore, there are frequent situations where delivery costs are very high, or even delivery is canceled. Do you know how sad it would be if the delivery was canceled when I ordered it because I was hungry? Not only are I'm sad, but I often waste time and eventually skip meals. This applies to other people. It is essential to build a restaurant infrastructure for everyone's health. 

     Last, since the infrastructure is not properly established, the advantage of promoting is not clear, so new people do not gather. This is the biggest problem. Since there is no play or various infrastructure, there are no people coming in and there ar not many people, so the government is not very interested in urban development. This vicious cycle is repeated. Therefore, it is necessary to start bringing in new infrastructure and break this cycle. 

     In conclusion, I think chainging infrastructure is essential for our hometown. There are three reasons. There is nothing to enjoy, delivery - related problems, and no tenants. What would happen to the city if there is only demand and no supply? Eventually, it will collapse through a vicious cycle. Therefore, it is urgent to change infrastructure. "	4.0	4.5	3.5	12.0
1423	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"   KAIST students spend most of time to studying. We wake up at 8:00 am, and we usually listen to class for 6 hours each day. After class, we have to do a lot of homework. This kind of life causes great stress for students. So, I  insist that we need to reduce amount of assignments given to students for two reasons. 

First of all, It makes difficult for students to do other thing except studying. We have a duty to study, but other activities other than studying are also of great help to us. For example, Some KAIST students start to sell ‘Bungeoppang’ because they want to get new experiences. As in this case, college students need ti di a variety of things that coudn’t do in their school years other than study. In addition, instead of homework, if we do large scale club activity or exchange activities with other universitys, it will be an activity that can only be felt by universities.

The second reason that  assignments given to students cause big stress for students. KAIST students are among considerably smart while they are hig school students. Therefore, They are not only smart, but also they are full of confidence. But, many assignments and other academic pressures make students tired, and some students are forced to get poor grades even though they have worked hard. I think this system has side effects that undermine some student’s confidence.

To sum up, If KAIST reduces amount of assignments given to students, students get various experience such as start-up activity, large scale club activity and exchange activities with other universitys. Moreover, It can reduce the stress students get. In conclusion, I hope that KAIST will reduce the assignments given to students , so we can engage in more diverse activities and have a leisurely life."	4.5	4.5	4.0	13.0
2086	Recommend a good place to spend the weekend with family/friends. Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Many people want to spend the time with family or friends to release the stress. There are a lot of place to go picnic such as mountains, valleys, rivers, and occeans. Especially the occean is one of the most popular places in summer.  Although some people say that occean is dnagerous and there is nothing to enjoy, I believe that occean is the most proper place to spend the weekend becauseof three reasons.
     First of all, the occeans are popular in summer. As I said in the above paragraph, many people go to occean in summer. Because of temperature, we can get stress a lot in summer, and we have to release the stress by get something cold. The occean is proper place to provide cold thing such as water. In my opinion, water of occeans is usually felt cool in summer because it is too hot outside a occean. In other words, the occean is most proper place to spend the time in summer.
     In addition to temperature, people can enjoy a lot of sports in the occean. People who go to occean used to play beach volleyball. To play beach volleyball, only the ball and net are needed, and the rule is also so simple that everyone can enjoy. There are also extreme sports in the occean such as surfing. People can get the feeling that surf the wave only in the occean. Therefore, the occean is useful place to play several sports.
     The occean can provid not only entertainment but also delicious seafoods. When people all enjoy the picnic in the occean, they may feel hungry, and find to restaurants to eat delicious foods. If there are no restaurants, they should spend many time to eat the foods. However, I remember that there are generally a lot of seafood restaurants near the occens. Because the source of seafoods are occeans, the restaurants near the occean can provide fresher seafood than another places.
     In conclusion, the occean is the best place to spend time with family or friends because of temperature, sports, and foods. If you want to go picnic with your family or friends, How about the occean?"	4.0	4.5	3.5	12.0
1927	In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, there are many people who do not marry and do not make family. In this social situdtion, friends became more important. People need comfortable home. In this sociaty which has a lot of one-people family, friend do that role instead of family. So, what is good friend? There are two qualities of a good friend.
First, relationship with good friend beyond material. We can just communicate with people at business. good friends do more than that. We can comunicate with good friend anytime and anywhere with no reason. Good friend can help me if there are losing his money and  time. 
Second, good friend should be comfortable. It is important that take care friend's feel. However, It does not mean that you need to do everything for him. there should be some mistakes and bad situations. Good friend is someone feel comfortable when I do mistake and it make me comfortable too.
third, good friend should be fun with me. If someone is kind and comfortable, but he is not fun with me, he is not a good friend. We spend much time with friend. So it is really important that I feel great when spend time with him.
In conclusion, good friend has realtionship beyond material,  good friend is comfortable and fun when I spend time with him. Good friend is getting more important right now. How about make good friend and comunicate each other?"	3.0	3.0	2.5	8.5
651	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"During our life, we all have some chances such as chance to attend a lecture, and to enter a famous university. By taking the chance, we can change our life. By changing our life to a better way, we can achieve success. In the other hand, some people believe that success comes from careful planning but not from taking risks or chances. However, I strongly believe that we can success by taking risks or chances.
Firstly, we tend to overestimate risks than benefits from our actions, and think doing nothing is best choice. For example, even though risks from COVID 19 is bigger than risks from vaccination, people think doing nothing and being exposed to risks of COVID 19 is better. This is because people overestimate risks from their action than benefits from their action. If there are both risks and benefits come from some action, people just think about risks about the action, and they think doing nothing is better. This stops people from getting benefits by acting and makes people do nothing. By taking small risk, people can taste sweet fruit of challanging.
Secondly, everyone can make careful planning. If we think about normal people, definitely there will be more people that can make plans carefully than people that can take risks or chances. Thinking about successed people tells us that extraordinary people tend to make great achievement in their life, and live so called successful life. For instance, president Roh lived a very special life. He graduated comercial highschool, and he became president of Korea eventually. Regardless of his achievements as president of Korea, we all think he lived successful life. If we become extraordinary people by taking risks or chances, we can achieve great success in our life.
Lastly, every good things have bad things inside, and we call them risks.  For example, jogging is definitely good for our health, but is has risk of falling or car accident. There is nothing with only positive aspects. Everything in our life has both positive and negative aspects at the same time. So, if we try not to take any risks, there is nothing that we can do in our life. Taking risks is essential in our life, and we should know how to take risks.
To sum up, we should take chances or risks to success, and there are three reasons. We tend to overestimate risks from our action, we can become extraordinary people by taking risk, and everything in our life has risks and we have to take it. If we want to live successful life, we should know how to take risks with courage, which is the greatest aspect of human essense."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0
862	University:Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. Others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.	"University Education For Everyone

     Today, most students study hard and prepare SAT to enter the better university. High-level university guarantees students get preferred jobs such as doctors or judges. For these reasons, some say a college education should be available to all students for equity; however, others did not think like that. Due to the purpose and efficiency of university education, higher education should be available only to good students for several reasons.
     First of all, the major purpose of university education is training students to become good researchers. To achieve this goal, students should learn more knowledge during their class time; however, if there are not-well-educated students, professors should spend much time to explain background knowledge to understand them. For example, teaching plus and minus operators to students in an advanced calculus class is very inefficient. The class requires high background knowledge level.
     In addition to the purpose of training researchers, a university education is efficient in the small-size class. For example, in Advanced English Writing class, the English class in KAIST, professors can give feedbacks to each student for their writing because the size of the class is small. If there are 200 students in each sections, it will be hard to give individual feedbacks. Because the number of professors is limited, forming university to public education system like high school is impossible. Therefore, only the good students should study in the university.
     Some argue that high tution fees of university makes poor students to enter there. They think university should be available for everyone to teach them. However, there are already scholarship system in many universities; therefore, well-educated students can get university education although they are poor. 
     To sum up, admission limitation of the university education has many positive effect. Students can learn complex knowledge with good students and study efficiently with small-size class. That is the reason why the university education is available only to good students."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
436	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"slience place.  Some students prefer to study alone, others like to study with a group of students. Some people say the study is the way of  standing alone. They think study alone is the best way to study. However, study with a group of students is much efficient than study alone.

People say study alone save the time because, we don't have to spend time to others. However, study with a group of students save much more time. When we study, there are the problems that we can't understand. If  we study alone, there is no one to ask the problem.  Solving the problem alone takes a lot of time, but if we study with group of students,  some member might know the answer of the problem. Also, we can share the tips during the studying. Asking the problem each other and sharing the tips are very helpful to save time. 

When we study with a group of students, some people think it's hard to focus on the study. They think  group study is one of the playing, and it's hard to concentrate. However it is not true. If  the members have a will of study, group study makes positive effects. A study cafe is the good example of it. When we go to a study cafe, everyone study hard. Also, for some people compare  themselves with others. These mood makes us more concentrate and focus to the study. The number of study cafe is still increasing. This shows people already know the positive effects of group study.

Study with a group is much efficient than study alone. We can save much more time and we can focus to the study hard by studying with a group.   How about make a study group and study with friends? I believe you can get much more  score and fun ."	4.0	4.5	4.0	12.5

622	If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. 	"  Many employers wonder what kind of people to hire. Some people claim that hire an experienced worker at a higher salary is better, but I think hiring an inexperienced worker at a lower salary is better. There are three reasons to support my opinion. 
  The most representative reason is low cost. We can hire more inexperienced workers than experienced workers in the same financial environment. It would be more efficient. Also, If the company has only experienced workers, each of them can have their own goal of work and different backgrounds. It can be difficult to coalesce their opinions into a single task. 
  In addition to the reason that lower cost is required,  there is also the reason that we can teach inexperienced worker. Employers and existing workers have advanced experience in their work. So, new inexperienced workers can learn and develop during the work by existing worker's teaching. And they can also teach the next new workers based on their experience. 
  Nevertheless, some people claim that hire an experienced worker is better. However, I think employers have to give a chance to inexperienced workers. Many companies prefer experienced workers because they already trained in their work. That is why inexperienced people are not given many opportunities. If this continues, a vicious circle can occur. 
  As clearly stated in the preceding paragraphs, hire an inexperienced worker at a lower salary is better than hire an experienced worker at a higher salary. Employers have to hire many inexperienced workers and give opportunities to them for the future."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
531	Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Time is fixed, therefore, it is precious and we should consume it wisely throughout our life. For this reason, I prefer to spend time with my two-three close friends. I have provided two reasons to explain my position.
   To begin with, more people means more opinions. It is hard to compromise and get everybody's satisfaction to do something in a group. For instance, when you are in a company of ten people and you are planning to gather at weekend to watch a movie. Because everybody has his/her own taste, it is difficult to choose a movie. Usually, such a group of people just waste 2-3 hours of their time just trying to find a movie that everybody approves of. Even though they find the amazing movie, there is a chance that someone might have watched it already. This period is just a waste of your time.
    Let's think about the advantages of a small group. I would say, it is their mobility. For example, a small group can take one taxi and still talk between each other as a whole, because they are only 3-4 people at all. For example, during summer vacation and two of my close friends traveled around Korea. Starting from seats at taxi to places around a table at Korean restaurants are dedicated to the small groups. Whenever you take a selfie or group photo, there a few people and more places to show the background(nature, statue, or city). Lastly, especially now, it is not allowed to gathere more than five people.
    All in all, spending time with a small group has at least two advantages such as finding compromise more quickly and moving around faster."	3.0	3.0	3.5	9.5
423	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"In university, a class is one of the most important components. I think students should attend classes. 

 At first, students should communicate with the professor. There can be some students who can get a good score on the exam without listening to the class, but the test is not everything in the class. Professor can say something that doesn't relate to a test but is helpful for students. Also, in the class, we can learn how to listen to the other's talking carefully, keeping time, and many other things. 

 Secondly, we need some reward for faithful students. As I argued in the first reason, a good score is not everything. University should teach some social skills and let the students build good characters. If the attendance becomes optional, it is hard for students to learn faithfulness. 

 Lastly, a university is a school, not a testing institution. Students go to university to learn something. If they already know everything, they don't have to come to the university and the class. Someone can claim like this: ""If students don't attend the class, they can learn nothing. So, it is their responsibility. The university should not force to attend."" However, university has a responsibility to lead all students to learn the class. Attendance is the smallest policy for it.

 I think attendance should not be optional because of these three reasons. "	3.5	3.0	3.0	9.5

  Nowadays, many countries want to be a seller in global market of IT modules. That's because IT modules can be used our house, hospital, school... etc. They can be used in everywhere that needs rapid comunication system or wants some help from others in the network. Although, they are not only useful but also flexible. We don't have to prepare many things to use them; they just need a PC or a tablet to use them and many people already have those. That's the biggest difference of IT modules with the past-Technology that were used in many places - like ID cards -. People are being free of buying new things to use Techs.
So, that's why many countries  wants to be a seller of IT modules. 
  However, the opportunity of being a seller is not for everyone. To being a seller, they must be a ""delicate"" engineer first. Without having a great engineering skills, they can't improve the Technologies of other countries and make them to their own Technology. Because crowds don't want to buy a replica -they prefer to buy an original one. - , a country that can't make their own lost their power in the competition.  So, we must try making some ""delicate"" engineers to be a seller.
 That's the most important point. In these days, our country ( Korea ) hardly try making engineers. They just make a proletatrias that can work well in locked position, not in flexible position.This one is very critical for engineers who need flexible thinking and wide view. If this atmosphere of society maintains for a long time, we could never make a delicate engineers and never be a great seller of IT modules. So I want to change that point. We must try to see our country from the out of the box for a while. Then we can change many things."	2.0	2.0	2.5	6.5
652	Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"There are some debates that success in life comes from taking risks or chances or careful planning. Both ways can be a good choice, but I think that you need to make a plan for success. 
  First, why you should make a plan for success is you can expect what will be happened. You are expecting what will be happened means you are ready for the future. Although your plan would not be all same to real situation, overall flow is quite similar to your plan. Even if there are some mistakes in your plan or some accidents, you just revise the plan that match for recent situation and can overcome it. Also, while planning, you have to prepare for those kinds of accidents because planning for accidents is part of your plan, too. 
  Second, planning for success is more efficient than taking risks or chances. Just taking risks or chances is dangerous because you are taking risks or chances. Its results are good, then you will just keep trying taking risks. If the result is bad, it is hard to overcome because you just wait next chances. On the other hand, after you plan for success, you just follow you plan. If you meet some mistakes, your plan will show you what to do. 
  Despite ample evidence in support of the topic, some people think that taking risks or chances is better way than planning the future. It is hard to expect what will be happened, and you sometimes unreach or fail to small goal. However, your plan will show you what to do, where to go, what you want, and why you are trying. 
  For these reasons, planning for success is better way than taking risks or chances. By making a plan for success, you can be ready for future and you can get success efficiently. Just think that life is chess. If you are going to win chess, you have to find how to attack and defense. In same way, you have to make a plan how to approch to you goal and what you prepare. Then, how about making a plan for your career or goal."	4.0	4.5	4.0	12.5

Moreover, we cannot help to take more time to go some place in Seoul than using the car. On top of that, the time interval of subway is very long.

901	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Various Subjects are Helpful to the Students

          Today, many universities in Korea make students to select their majors when they enter the university. However, this is not a good idea for students.  Students need the grace period to think about their majors. And during that period, students can take classes that they want. There are several reasons why students need rights to have the grace period to choose their majors.
          Firstly, most students are pressured from the burden of the university entrance exams throughout high school era in Korea. Therefore, they do not know well what they want to study in general. In this situation, choosing the majors early and specializing on that major can lead students to the wrong choice. It would be a great loss for both university and students.
          Secondly, even though students select there majors in their own hands, they would find that the majors could not suit them. In this case, students just should take the class that they are not interested in, and it is very harmful for students' future. If students can take many kinds of classes for various majors, universities can prevent these things from happening.;for example, in KAIST, freshmen can take any classes, and they can choose their majors after a year. They can find majors that suit their aptitude for a year. And after choosing that, if the majors do not suit, they can change freely.
          However, Some people would say that all the choices that students make are their responsibility. That is true. However, university not just academic institutions in today. It is for a better future for students. In this regard, university should ensure that students have wider options for their futures.
          In Conclusion, the university requires students to take a variety of majors.

1246	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are four reasons about the advantages of taking online courses in college.
First, people can join in lecture at anytime. If they has some important appointment so he couldn't join the real-time lecture. Professors have to call off the class and students have to absent for class. However in case of online course, they can join lecture at time he or she can. Taking video or attending online class at anytime they want. And also, people have their own concentrate time; late of night or afternoon anything, so they can choose time they can concentrate to lecture. And also, we can join in other college students or lecture by online. This makes more big chance for conversation that make people to get lots of view about title. It is really big benefit for professors and student. In other word, professors and students both can be free at time and location.
Second is student can look lecture over and over again so, it's more easier to understand un-understandable content. Always there are content that can't understand what it means in lecture. In online lecture, student can watch lecture many time so they can look again ""hard to understanding part"". This is very helpful for student to encourage his or her capability of knowledge. Also, if there are some new concept students can stop lecture and search that word or phenomenon what makes easy to understand. 
Next it gives chance for disabled. We know that it's not easy for disabled to join all classes in college. There are no subtitle or hand-language in offline class or it's hard to go the classroom. But for online course, it is more easier for them to join in class as non-disabled students. For example, we can put subtitle in video so deaf can also join in class. It is most good affect about online course. Give everyone the same opportunity to learn and develop his or her capability.  
Last, student can ask their question more easily. As you know, for Korean students, it is not easy to ask question in offline courses because there are no raise hand culture. While in online class, there are more students who ask their curiosity by chatting. It makes more effective lecture.
These are the advantages of taking online courses in college. In short, both professor and student can join in class at any time and any where, more effective to understand lecture, comfortable for disabled student to join in class and asking question is more comfortable than offline courses."	3.5	4.0	3.0	10.5
1910	In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"The Qualities of A Good Student
     We have to go elementary and middle school because going to elementary school and middle school is mandatory in Korea. Thus, being a good student is important. If you are a good student, you can get a lot of advantages from school. In my opinion, honesty, friendship and passion are the qualites of a good student.
     First, honesty is a important part of a good student. The students interact to many people in school because there are many students and teachers. To develop relation, trust is necessary. Since trust can be made by showing honesy, honesty is a importnat part. The students also receive many tasks by teachers. The honesty is a necessary to make good results for tasks. 
     Not only being honesty but aslo making friendship is a quality of a good student. we can meet many people in school. During school activites, we have to interact to friends to collaboration for homeworks. Students also need friends to play. For these reasons, making friendship is very important quality of a good student. 
     Lastly, passion is also a quality of a good student. In school, students have to do many tasks. If a student don't have passion about a task, student will be bored. After student is bored, student does not want to do task. Because of this, having passion is very important. If student has passion about task, student will get good result about task. 
     As a result, I argued that the qualities of a good student are honesty, friendship and passion. Because most of people have to be students for a long time, having the qualities of a good student is important. If you have the qualities of a good student, you can enjoy your school life.

Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer	" In the past, I liked to do only what I already to do well. because I was used to doing it. And I had confidence on it. It was nice to be praised for doing what I was good at. Usually, trying new things made me feel scared. I thought about myself as a successful student as I entered KAIST, so I was afraid of failure. It was definite that when I failed, people would sympathize with me. I really didn't want to be sympathized by others. And I didn't want to make others disappointed of me. I just wanted to keep succeeding.
 But now, I prefer to try new things and take risks because I realize that I should improve myself in various ways to get what I want in the future. Trying new things makes me improve variable capacity. And I believe that improving variable capacity will increase probability of success. If I like to do only what I already to do well, I can be an expert on that part. But, unless trying new things and taking risks, I won't solve many complicated problem in society. And also in science, It is definite that there are not simple problems which can be solved by one part, but many complex problems which we should thing of two or more parts to solve. Especially while doing research, I realize that knowledge in various fields is necessary. I was afraid of failures, but now I know that greatest growth is in the process of reflecting on failures and correcting them. It's painful when I fail, but that's when I can grow the most. Even if the experience is not related to my field, It can be applied to other fields, and it becomes a memory in itself. so I think I prefer to try new things and take risks. And it's good for myself."	2.0	2.0	3.0

1757	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"One important thing to improve Korea

Everything, or everyone cannot be perfect. But people know that just one important change might significantly improve them. What about the country? Even South Korea(ROK) has amount of provblems, one important change can make South Korea better country. This paper is going to argue about South Korea will be better if it unites with North Korea, as known as DPRK.
First of all, there are so many problems in ROK which are caused by DPRK. Today in ROK, males' military service is very big issue. Every korean males should join military service if they don't have serious disease of disability. This is because ROK and DPRK is rest-in-war of Korean War. Uniting two countries might smallen their military, and it will stop military service. This means males can get their job earlier, and it might solve low birth problem of ROK. Also, there are some political issues which are caused by division of Korean Peninsula. Parties of Korea have fought over 60 years with the issue about DPRK. The issue was 'are some parties work just for DPRK?' Of course the stage to get united Korea might be difficult, the end session will definitely finish those problems, or issues.
Secondly, economic problem can be solved. As well known, ROK has high technology and industry, and DPRK has workers with low prices. During the time of uniting, companies of ROK can make products with cheaper cost than before. Furthermore, these companies will improve economy of North, and it means DPRK can be a market of ROK's companies. Also, the unstableness of economy which is caused by division can be solved. Since Korean Peninsula is on war, foreign companies are afraid to put money, or invest ROK. Uniting will end the threat of war, then foreign money can improve Korean economy faster than before.
Lastly, big country can make bigger voice in global issues. This 'big' does not means big land(area), but it means numbers of citizen and power of economy. Look at recent global issues. Countries which have power or large voice are mostly big countries, such as US, China, etc. Even Korea is one of big country, it was hard to make voice, or give an idea of issue. Issues about human rights problems of China, or Taiwan issue might be good examples. United Korea will have more population and economical power by upper reasons, so can make own voice in global society.
In conclusion, there are many problems of distinct subjects in Korea such as military, politics, economy, etc. Uniting of ROK and DPRK can solve those problems on time. Furthermore, solving those problems makes enough powerful to make its own voice in global issues. Therefore, one important change-uniting of Korean Peninsula- will definitely improve South Korea to be a better country."	5.0	4.5	3.5	13.0

112	Government: Some people think that governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. Other people disagree and think that this money should be spent on more basic needs. Which of these opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Korea need money on developing computer technology

In these days, Korea has economical issue, that is, where should government use money. Some people say that money should be spent on basic needs because there are many people in Korea who cannot buy own home, eat food that they want. On the other hand, other people say that money should be spent on developing technology, especially computer technology. In my opinion, government should help developing computer technology instead improving basic needs for several reasons.
First of all, developing computer technology can make future lives more convenient. Nowadays, autonomous electronics are developing in many countries, since they are more convenient in several parts. For example, many companies are developing the autonomous vehicles, and other companies are developing smart television or robot that can help our living. Computer technology is strongly needed on these autonomous electronics; since autonomous electronics are moving by computer codes. As a result, spending money on computer technology have high probability to make future lives more convenient.
Next, South Korea's strength on international trade market is computer technology. Companies like Samsung or LG are in the first group of the electronics, which computer technology is strongly needed. If government does not spend money to computer technology, Samsung or LG can lose their power in the market. That can cause the weakness of the South Korea on international trade market.
Some arguments say that country can be more stable and stronger when its basic needs are enough. On the other hand, developing computer technology can make power in international market. Then country can get more money by selling computer technology; as a result, country can spend money on basic needs. This cycle will make country more stronger and economically better.
To sum up, government should spend money on developing computer technology for several reasons: making future lives more convenient, keeping strength on electronics market, making better cycle on the money in country. Spending money on computer technology cannot affect to people's lives instantly. However, people can live better in the future."	4.5	4.0	4.5	13.0
1675	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"My university is KAIST focuses on science and technology in Korea. There are many differences between different universities because of the focus of science and technology. Because of the gender imbalance in my university and the difficulty of taking classes in various fields, I think KAIST students cannot have various experience. From now on, I will explain what I want to change to our school.
     First of all, I want to change the gender imbalance in my university. According to this year's statistics, KAIST's gender ratio is 8 to 2, which has a very large gender imbalance. There is a word ""hakyeondong"" in Korea. It means love experience is important as studing. However, many male students in KAIST are in a difficult environment to have love experience as university stuents. Gender ratio is important not only in love but also in academic and various thoughts. So, I hope many female students enter KAIST and balance the gender ratio of the KAIST.
     Last, I want to change my university so that I can take classes in various fields. In KAIST student community, it is often posted that they want to take classes in various fields. Due to the nature of KAIST, the propotion of major classes in engineering is overwhelmingly high and there are limited types of liberal arts classes available. I think cutural knowledge is important to engineer. So, I hope KAIST will open many liberal arts classes so that students can have various knowledge.
     To sum up, I hope KAIST students have various experience. To move in that direction, KAIST should make improvements in the gender imbalance and number of liberal arts classes. I hope KAIST students study with various experiences in KAIST and do more wonderful things in the world as engineer."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

696	Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	   I think it is better to enjoy my money when I earn it. The purpose of earning money is to be happy. In my case, I feel positive feelings when I eat something or meet my friends. Also, to do such an activity, you will need some money to use.  You may think It is okay to save your money for some time in the future. Of course,  some people enjoy their time in the future by paying money that they earned before. But, If I save my money now, I am sad now because I can't do anything with my friends. For example, During this KAIST vacation, I enjoy my money . However, my best friend earns money and saves them to use next time. After the end of summer vacation, there are some differences between me and my friend. my friend frustrated due to the end of the vacation. she didn't enjoy her time because she worked every day. On the other hand, I'm satisfied with my vacation. During vacation, I went to Jeju Island, ate black-pig, saw the sea, and met my familiar people. In this process, I can charge my energy and prepare before the next semester.  I do not regret my choice. I am just a student now. So, I can't earn much money to buy expensive things such as car, house, and pet. However, I can get some enough money just like having a lunch with my friends.  If you want to save your money for some time in the future, I recommend you to save money when you earn big money after you get a job. I think it is better choice because unlike before, you will have many chance to enjoy something with much money. There is exactly no answer. I believe best answer to this question is to consume according to your situation. But, In my case, for these reasons, It is better to enjoy my money when I earn it.	2.0	2.0	2.5	6.5
1583	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"One important thing which seriously affects us is studying same thing. 
As korean students, parents and teachers force us to study more, encouraging not to play and enjoy our own life. 
We don't know academic thing at 7~8 years, but we must study mathematics, korean, and even foreign at elementary school.
In such situation, we started to study same thing during 9 years.
Because entering elementary school, and middle school is necessary course in korean, we learn SAME thing without one's talent or interest.
I think this part has serious problem, making us chase one point like having nice business or going to great university.
If we don't stick to such studying law, i can strongly say that our country will develope. 
There aren't same people. All people have different talent, want to know different thing. 
So, we try to give a new studying course for new generations. 
I think we must give them to choice interesting part for 9 years (even game, gamble, traveling... and etc).
By checking their interesting part(although they felt bad after really doing it), they will seek their own road.

1933	In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  I think a good friend help me when I have some worries or hard problems. It is because I think it can make good interaction with each other. We can meet many problems in our life. They are not easy to solve own power. So, I think we need to have some people who can help us. 
  In my case, I graduated science high school and I have many stress in there. Because, I didn't like studying, but I needed to study hard in school. Also,  many students studied hard in school and they concentrate competition about grade.  My feeling is bad for a long time about them. This feeling makes me powerless. I slept all the time in school and I forgive study. My friends tried to make my feeling good.  They needed to study, but they think they made my feeling better is more important. At the result, I'm not depressed anymore.  I wanted to die before then. But, nowdays I like my life and I want to make more good memories with my priceless friends. Now, my goal is making good memories with people who gave me some helps. Also, I want to give lots of helps to them.
  I have another memories about some worries. When I was young, my dream is baseball player or art teacher. But, I went middle school, and I tested first middle-term exam. I have good grades about that and my score is too high. So, my parents wanted me to study. But, I didn't want. It is because I hadn't done study before then, I was scared about that. But, My friends told me ""You can do it!"". So, I had some confidence about studying. That times made me study.  At the result, I came KAIST, I think I'm little bit sucess in studying. And, I think my friends made me sucess. 
  So, I think friends can make someone's life. All the people have one risk at least in whole life. And, good friends need to be a power in that time. Then, I think giving some helps and making some good conection makes good interaction. This friends can make us live with good feeling. And, They can be a reason why we need to live hardly.

1430	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"   The freshmen of KAIST expect the best campus life. Obiously, professors and classmates are among the best in the world. However, there is a flaw in KAIST's cmapus life. That is the dormitory communal toilets and shower booths. The problem has two negative aspect, so I choose this what i want to change.

   First, it has privacy problem. Though there are screens in the shower rooms, but there is no screen in changing room. So, freshmen are forced to show thier naked bodies to other people. Most people might feel ashamed of this situation. Especially, someone withe physical complex will be reluctatnt to take a shower.

   Second. the common toilets and shower booths have quarantine problems. Since Corona 19, quarantine has become very important. However, many people share a few toilet in common toilet, which can lead to hygiene problems. If one of the dormitory members gets infected withe Corona 19, it will be easy to become a mass infection through the bathroom.

   In conclussion, the toilet and shower booth have problems with collective hygiene as well as individual rights. To solve these, each room have to have a toilet. If that happens, satifaction of students with school life will increase."	4.5	4.0	4.0	12.5

308	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Most of the universities give subjects student to evaluate them. In each semester, students are required to submit one or more subject. The number of total subject is directly connected with students grade, happiness, and so on. So it is important to decide weather one subject or more in class. This essay argue about the three point that why university need to take many subjects; effective study, effective evaluation, fewer risk.

First, many subjects can help effective study. University students almost do not spend a lot of time to study because there are so many things to do. And they usually start the subjects right before the deadline. If some classes give one subject to students in each semester, they may study the subject just one time. Even they could study about just one part of the lectures which is relative to that subject. This is never effective way to increase their knowledge. Students need to study with a cycle, and various subjects help them. 

Second, evaluate student with just one subject is not a good way. In one lecture, they learn a lot of thing and each students have their own interesting. For example, let's assume that student A is interested in chapter 1 and not good at chapter 2. And professor give a subject about chapter 2. Maybe, A is going to get a lower score than his ability. Therefore, universities need to evaluate various ability in students with a many subject.

Finally, many subject decrease the risk. There are unpredictable situations in our lives. Before the deadline, students can get damage on their product, or computer viruses, emergency situation, and so on. Following reasons, some students cannot complete their mission in time. If there is just one big subject, the risk is so high. Many separable subjects protect students from these bad situations. 

In conclusion, because many subjects bring effective study, effective evaluation, fewer risk, university need to make many subjects in a class. Some people think one subject is much more simple. So some students may feel stressful about a lot of subject, but they will satisfy about it in the future."	3.0	3.5	3.0	9.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"I prefer to try new things that take risks. When I was young, it was easy and comfortable to do only what I already do well. And I was also afraid to failure that came from what I tried new things and couldn't success. But I had a question about it. If I keep going to do only what I already do well, is it helpful for my growth?
 My answer is 'no'. I think trying new things is what we have to do. When we do new things and success well, we can feel much achievement. This will be a large courage for us to participate another new thing.
 The risk also can be an obstacle to start a new thing. We need to handle the risks from new things. We also have to practice how to solve the risk when we meet it. Then, the risk won't be a problem when you participate something you don't know well.
 We can see the proof in history that trying new things give us development. The human keep developed to try new things in historical sight. The human used natural things first such as stones, branches. And someone used steels that they hadn't used before. Using steels was gave a largest development for the human. And these performance is keep going by us until now.

1843	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"    You can be the ganster legally if you want to be. It is actually in the Internet, not reality. The game industry is increasing very rapidly with developing technology. We can also easily find various violent games, such as GTA, Walking Dead, and other combat games. These games sometimes are very terrible because of violent and illegal scenes. Although these games are limited for over 19 years old to protect kid from those violence. Violent video games affect kids in a negative way for three reasons.
    First of all, children are easily influenced by violent video games. They easily learn various violent contents from video games. Because they are young, they can't think about its badness and just absord everything from games. This lead to establishing bad thoughts of the world.  Moreover, kids could mimic these violent scenes in school. This make various problems of school, such as bullying or group fightings. As a result, many students are damaged by these mimictions.
    Second, video games could be effect to kid's growth. Children cannot easily sleep if they watch scary scenes. Violent video games consist of many scary and terrible scenes that could surprise children. When children saw these scenes in the afternoon, they could not sleep at night bacause of fearness. As a result, they sleep very late, so they cannot rest sufficiently. This causes children's slow growth. In addition, mind also cannot grow correctly. They just learn violence and various bad activities from video games. This make children be young than real ages.
    Lastly, health of child is very dangerous due to addict of games. They could resist to have dinner when they play the games. This could cause lack of nutritions. Moreover, long play time affect their neck and eyes. Bad and longtime fixed position is critical for body. In addition, they could drink or smoke, mimicing character of games. Drink and smoke is seriously negative to kid's health. In the severe case, they could be dead.
  In conclusion, violent video games have very dangerous elements for kids. Kids are very easily affected by violence of games, so they colud learn bad behaviors and mimic. Moreover, video games damages childrens's growth and health. "	3.5	3.0	3.5	10.0

     Many KAIST students live at the westside dormitories such as Huimang-Hall and Dasom-Hall. There are two ways to go Westside dormitory. One is from North through the Endless-load, and the other one is from South through KISTI. Some students who live in Westside dormitories, especially Huimang-Hall, ask to make a tunnel which through Eoun-Mountain. What is advantages from the tunnel?
     First of all, the time to go to the most KAIST campus building from the Westside decrease. Many students who live in the Westside dormytories walk around the mountain to go to the campus buildings that are rocated at the Northside and Eastside of KASIT. However, if there is the tunnel through the mountain, the walk time is surprisingly decrease. For example, when a student walk from W8 to Huimang-Hall, it takes about more than 10 minutes, but if the tunnel is rocated to connect W8 to Huimang-Hall, it decrease to about less than 2 minutes.
     Second, the tunnel can be the landmark of the KAIST. There are no university that has own tunnel in its campus in Korea. If the tunnel is made, KAIST become the first university which has the own underground civil engineering structure. It raises the honor of the Civil and Environmental Engineering department and can be the chance to be famous. 
    Finally, the usage of tunnel is various. The tunnel work not only as the walkway, but also as the place of convergence. SInce the tunnel do not need the viechel road, students can use the large place like busking place. In the Korea regulation, the width of tunnel is about 6m, and the two way walkroad is about 2m. The 2m from the edge can be used freely, and creative students in KAIST can use it creatively.
     To sum up, making the tunnel through the Eoun-Mountain decrease movetimes of students who live is the Westside dormitories, it can be the landmark of KAIST, and sudents can use is various."	5.0	5.0	4.5	14.5
2188	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"If I could change one thing about my country, I want to change  my country's ground to have many resources. And there're three reasons.
First,  As we know, our country doesn't have many resources. So we have to import resources from another country such as mideastern coutnries. Although we adapt our environment and develop many technics that transform pure resources to useful thing, I think if we have pure resources that can be found in our ground we can save money that is needed to buy pure resources.
Second,  with our technology, we can manufacture  goods ourselves. From pure resource to perfect goods, we can do all parts  just in our  country. And it will lead our country to export-strong country. 
Last,  we would not have to be influenced by other country's condition. For example, many fules are  concentrated to few countries and the price of  resources can be changed unexpectedly according to the countries. If we have enough resources, we don't have to face unexpected situation and it will make our economy stable.
 For these reasons, I want our country to have enough resources."	2.5	2.5	2.5	7.5
701	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"I would suggest him to use all of money to buy a car because of several reasons. Vacation is short, but we can ride a car for a long time and we can get more effects from buying a car. They are not a opposite arguments, so it is hard to compare them, but buying a car would be better than going on vacation.
 First, vacation is a short choice, car is a long choice. When we go to the vacation and take some rest, maybe we would feel great. But, that feeling will disapear in a short time. Usually we go to the vacation about some weeks~1 month. Actually, 1 month is not a short time, but when we compare it with car, it becomes very short. If we use all of money for it, we will feel something strange after the vacation. We can experience other culture, eat many delicious foods, do expansive activity like sky diving, and take a rest with vacation. The true is that we can't get something usefull to us except for some gifts. It would be very short fun, very short choice. On the other hand, if we use  all of money to buy a car, we can ride it for a really long time. If we didn't make a car accident and keep a car clearly, we can ride it about many years. It's really longer than vacation. 
 The next reason is from the effect of the choices. Maybe almost people would agree that vacation have some positive effects. But as we said above, those short effects can't help our real life. And when we come back to our home, we will feel tired, it is hard to work again. However, car gives us so many good effects. The biggest one is convinience. If we have a car, we can go more various place easily and fastly. For example, in KAIST, it is hard to go to the other place cross the Gap river without car. Even if we don't choose vacation, we can go vacation easily with a car. And we can go to the work easily. The second effect of car is about money. We can save money with car. Without car, we need to use subway, bus, taxi, and some borrow mobility like electric kickboard. If we save this money for a year, it will be very big money. And when we go to the vacation with car, we can choose more places to go, but the money will saved a lot. Train and bus costs almost over the 50000 won. 
 To sum up, by these reasons, car is longer choice and car gives us more good effects, using all of money to buy a car would be the better choice. In modern life, car is one of the good things for our life. Even if we go to the meating, having car is great effect to match to other people. It doesn't mean that vacation is not good. It just mean car has much more advantages than vacation. If we choose vacation, we will happy for that short time, but we will regret our choice for a long time."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
555	You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are many problems with roommate at dormitory rooms when we live in dormitory. I think choosing my own roommate is better than university assigning a student to share a room with me. There are some reasons why I think like this.
 First, if one of roommate come from other country, it will be difficult to communicate and understand each other. For example, not all of KAIST students are good at English. But, if they have foreign country roommate, it will be hard to communicate each other. Furthermore, being friendly with each other is not easy because of language.
 Second, there are many conflict with roommate. If we choose roommate that can understand each other, it will be fine. I think this reason is why many of KAIST students choose roommate who is at same club, same class, and graduated same high school. 
 Third, it is more easy for university dormitory department. In KAIST, many student use changing roommate system. It is very hard to check because university assign a student first, and students change roommate next. So if student choose roommate, it would be more convinence for university.
 I think choosing my own roommate is better because of communication, understanding each other, and convinence of university."	3.0	3.0	3.0	9.0
995	Lifestyle: Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer	" I prefer to try new things and take risks. There are three reasons why I try to do new and risky things. First, you are not able to achieve bigger success you really wanted if you do not take risks. Second, if I success after trying new and risky things, it makes me happier than just doing the things I do well already. Finally, you can get some important lesson by failing that will help through whole life.
 You can achieve bigger success through doing new challenging works. When something is risky, it means it will give you high return for the usual cases. So it makes us to get more things that we wanted. Also, if you try new things and achieve some success in the field, you will be able to mix two things you can do well. Then you may be better at the thing you already do well by trying new things and it may leads to a bigger success.
 Second, you can feel better feelings if you get a success on new things. Just doing the things that you are already good at and achieve some good result may give you good feelings. However, it can't be better than the feelings you get from new things. When you try some new challenging works, then you will feel nervous. So, if you get good results though you are feeling nervous, then you can feel the additional hapiness that you achieve good results though you are doing new feeling nervous.
 Finally, we can get good lesson by your failure. Though you fail for new things, it's not just failure. Failure will give you good lesson to go through when you challenge again for the new things. Thomas Edison fail hundred times to develop light bulb. Other great mans also go through lots of failure. So, if you learn something from the failure, you may be better and you can try the thing again. Then you may get success, and it will be more precious success for your life.
 In conclusion, you can get bigger success by doing new things. Then you may feel happier than just doing the thing you can do well already. You may not fear whether you may fail or not. You can get great lesson from the failure and be better than before. Therefore, I prefer to do new and risky things."	3.0	3.0	3.0	
462	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"There are a lot of people who study hard. Some people say that studying alone is the best way to study. Others say that studying with other students is better than studying alone. In my opinion, studying with a group of students is better than studying alone.
First of all, some people say that in case of studying with a group of students, students would spend time to talk with others. However, students can study efficiently through studying with other students. The reason of the efficiency is that students can share opinions with others. Assume that someone doesn't know about something that he or she is studying. If he or she studies alone, he or she should find it in the textbook or should search it on the Internet. On the other hand, if he or she is studying with his or her group members,  they can know about it immediately by sharing ideas. Because of this, students who study with others can spend less time than students who study alone. 
Second, there are some people who believe that students who study alone can concentrate fully on studying something. However, students who study with their group members can concentrate better on studying something. This is because of the atmosphere to study. When someone is studying, the environment affects him or her a lot. If students study with others, they cannot do other things like playing games because other students are study hard around them. Therefore, group study can increase the concentration of the students.
Finally, some people argue that students should not study with friends when they are studying. However, studying with other students can make close friendship with them. One of the most important purposes which the education has is the friendship of students. However, if students do not study with others, they would find other ways to make friends. On the other hand, students who study with their group members can easily get closed with them. 
In conclusion, studying with group members is the better way to study than studying alone. Some people argue that studying alone is better than studying with a group of students. However, group study have higher efficiency, higher concentration. In addition, students can have close relationship between other students by studying with them. I hope that students can study efficiently by studying with a group of students."	4.5	4.0	4.0	12.5
473	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"KAIST students have different styles of study. Some of them prefer to study alone, and others prefer to study in group. Those who prefer to study alone insist that they can more concentrate on their study when they study alone. Although there are some advantages of studying alone, I believe that study with a group of students is more efficient way to study.

    First, many have argued that study with a group is waste of time. They insist that if they study together, they feel that they are wasting a time discussing about what they already aware. However, in the process of studying together, we can realize that our misunderstaning knowledge that we thought that have understood. In addition, we can organize the contents by explaining our understanding of knowledge to our friends, and evaluate my understanding. Also, we can accumulate knowledge by asking our friends about things that we did not know or not sure. Therefore, study with a group is more better way to study in terms of efficiency.

    Others argue that, study with a group is harder to concentrate than studying alone. In other words, they claim that if they study with their friends, they will have a chat any will not be able to focus on their studies. However, studies have shown that most people experience more efficiency when they study with their friends. According to statistics from the National Institute of Education, studying in a group showed much more achievement on the exam comparing with studying alone. The researchers conducted an experiment in two groups of students in the fourth grade(about B0) of the mock test of korean SAT. Group A studied alone, and Group B studied by sharing opinions with their group. After three months, the average grade of mock test was 4.2, while Group B’s average test grade was 3.3. Also, the post survey result show that the feeling of concentration also high-rated on Group B compared with Group A. The study results directly refute the opposition insisted that studying together reduces concentration. 


    In conclusion, although studying alone has some benefits, to study as a group showed two benefits compared to study alone. The first factor is that the efficiency of studing has increased, and the second factor is that they could concentrate more easily with studying in a group."	4.5	4.5	4.0	13.0
1273	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  Many company leaders or high-level company members in Korea are doing their best to accomplish their jobs and get the highest revenues. But in the process of pursuing such achievements they often behave badly to their subordinates and hurts their emotion. They also often do not understand or forgive one-time mistake of the members in lower positions. This kind of behavior is one of many factors which degrades the morale of many employees in Korea and even gives a bad image about the country to many new-bies in Korea.

  Although I am currently not in a high position in any company, not even a company employee, I believe I can change such harsh environment of my country in the future. I am basically generous to anyone. I have not make revenge to anyone who directly or indirectly hurt me, but just tried to understand why they were hurting me and which aspects of mine caused such events. For example, when I was a 11-th grade student I had some senior students who behaves badly and sometimes gave insulting words to lower-grade students, including me. At first I did not understand why there doing in such way and felt a sad feeling about my destiny. But soon I realized that they were stressed out due to the preparation of the university entrance exam, so I decided not to care much about their actions. I am also able to quickly discharge the bad emotions and hatred arising in my mind. For example, I had a friend who once spreaded a false and bad information about me to his friends. I became really angry just after I noticed the incidence, but I did not fully express the anger to him. Instead, I decided to take a nap and within two hours I returned to my ordinary emotional state. As a result, there was no serious happening at the time; it just ended with a mild warning directed to my friend.

  Although my generous personality will not directly change my country, I believe that when I obtain a high position in a company many followers and colleagues will be affected by my behavior and then make gradual effects in the company, society, and the country."	2.0	3.0	4.0	9.0

2018	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"After TV was invented, many video contents like movie, Drama, TV show and News developed a lot.  And now we use mobile phone or Tablet to watch video contents through Netflix and YouTube. So I think people influenced a lot from TV or movie. 
First, people are sensitive to trend. people want to belong to group. So if they don't know trend, they can't belong to large group. Because in group we need to use meme or trend expression. I think movies and TV provide these trends. For example after '극한직업'  become popular, many people find '수원 왕갈비 통닭'. Because '극한직업' provided a trend, '수원 왕갈비 통닭'. And if an actor wear a clothes,  many people want to buy that. These are evidences the TV and movie influence people's behavior.
Second, TV programs are provocative. TV show need many viewers because they earn money through Advertisements. So they make more provocative contents. For example Japan made much provocative contents like horror or gag. people attracted from strong stimulus. Because the behavior in TV show are different with reality. So people get curious on TV and they replicate it. 
In conclusion many people influenced from TV program. But TV show try to make more provocative contents. If we replicate all behavior in Tv, Society will be confused. So we need to control ourself. "	3.5	3.5	2.5	9.5

1980	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	There are so many people that go travel to foreign country. They travel because of many reasons like leisure and work. I think that traveling to foreign country is experience. So If I have the opportunity to travel, I must be going to travel Japan. In addition, I have three reasons why I want to go Japan. First of all, Japan has East Asia, so Japanese people have culture that they eat rice. It is very important to eat delicious food to survive not just enjoy. For example, I can't eat many foods in America because they is very salty. However, in Japan, I can eat a lot of foods with rice. I can't live without meals, so I have to go where has foods which have proper taste. The second reason that I want to go Japan is the subcultures. I have hobby that watching animation and cartoon. In addition, Japan makes animation and cartoon very well. It means when I go to Japan, I can buy the goods of my favorite character. I will happy with my goods, and I think it means the travel is fun. Finally, Japan is very close to Korean. When I went to U.S.A, I can't sleep in night and I tired on daytime. Because U.S.A is too far for Korea, I need to change my sleeping pattern. However, I think it is wasting my time, so I don't want to change sleeping pattern. It is very good to hear that Japan is close to Korea. Tokyo use the same time with Seoul so I can sleep on time. To summarize, Japan has foods similar to Korea so I can eat well. In addition, there are subculture goods of my favorite characters. Finally, I don't need to change my sleeping pattern. Traveling Japan has many benefits to me, so I want to go to Japan. If the covid19 is finish, I will go to Japan with my friends.	2.0	2.0	2.0	6.0
1415	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" In KIAST, all freshmen have to use the north dormitory with random friends whole one year. Freshman cannot choose which dormitory and room they would like to live in, and cannot live with friend who wants to live with. This system has positive aspects. For example, it encourages freshman to make other new friends during first year of school. But I think this dormitory system makes some problems. There are two points that make me having negative opinion about our dormitory system.

 First, we can make friends through outside of dormiotry. The main points of our dormitory system is that freshman can make new college friends in dormitory by living together. But most of students make only one or two roommate friends, and they usually make friends by having same club, doing same activities in school, and taking same class. And through these process, students can meet more various students in school than dormitory. So, I think there are many good ways to make friends even though freshmen live individually.

 Second, all students' needs are different. There are so many dormitory buildings and various types of room. We can choose the location of dormitory, and how many friends we want to live with from second year students. But our dormitory system only regulates freshmen to choose. Some freshmen also want to live individually, or some freshmen like to live with friends. Also, some freshman want to live the north dormitory which is close to E11, but some freshmen want to live the west dormitory even though it is far from other buildings because of insects problem. Therefore, I think our dormitory system has to give chance to freshmen, so freshmen also live comfortably during freshman year.

 To summarize, KAIST students can make lots of friends without dormitory and all students' needs are different. Because of these facts, I think our dormitory system has to be changed like giving chance to choose dormitory to freshmen, and also not mendatory to live in dormitory. If it change this way, freshmen could live more comfortably in dormitory during whole school years."	4.0	4.0	3.0	11.0
1212	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"What is good student? I think that student that makes their own decision is good student. Students that study hard, is humble, is polite and have their routine are also good. But if students have their own logic, they will be hard worker, regular person, etc.
So, qualities of good student is qualities of decision makers. First, good student has good self-esteem. Students have a few experiences. So their thinking, decision, and even personality are affected by surroundings. (ex. friends, parents, school). Moreover, students that have low self-esteem and confidence are more sensitive about people's eyes. So, it's hard to make their own decisions. That's why good students need self-esteem. Second, good student has no worries when they challenge new work and experience. To make decisions and their own philosophy, most important thing is experience. And, experience comes from challenge. So, to be a good student, you have to be willing to challenge new works again and again even though there are so many obstacles. Last, good students are good at self reflection. They always remind their footprints. And they learn something from the past. Before you look at other people, knowing yourself is more healthful behavior. I think that three things are important to be a good student."	2.5	2.0	3.0	7.5
2165	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Changing Grading Systems in KAIST

    KAIST is a university full of many students with passion to study. Many students work hard for better grades, but sometimes some students claim their grading is not reasonable. In KAIST, the majority of the students consider it is particularly hard to get better grades contrast to other universities in Korea, for instance, Seoul National University and POSTECH. In my opinion, the grading system in KAIST is mostly acceptable, but there are some parts that make the KAIST students difficult to accept them. Therefore, I think the grading systems need to change in certain parts. My opinion is supported by the following reasons.
    First, there are some cases that KAIST's grading systems could become a handicap for the students who takes the lecture for the first time, but it becomes an advantage for the ones who are taking it once more.  In KAIST, it is possible for the students who got a grade lower than B- to take the lecture again and make the grade better. Although these students could have maximum grade of A-, I think it is one of the good systems for the students who think they took a lecture too early. I do not oppose to this system, but I think the problem is in the other place. The grading system grades the students equally regardless they are taking the lecture again or not, and then the system drops the grades of the students that are taking the lecture once again. Therefore, it is possible for the students who took the lecture for the first time to compete with the students who already have experience about the lecture. This can possibly make no students getting A+ at all. In my opinion, grading with different standards are going to be needed.
    Second, I think the attendance grading must be unified among classes. In some lectures in KAIST, there are multiple classes managed by different professors due to the large number of the students. This often leads to different grading policy of attendance, and it creates some cases students could possibly be confused of. For example, some classes of calculus does not check the attendance and apply full score on attendance, but some classes apply attendance scores scored by submitting quizzes and assignments. by the difference of the policy, some students in the former class often take penalty from the final grade. Even though students in the former class received better grades on the exams, sometimes the benefits  of the full attendance score affects less than the later class students who got full attendance score. Because of this, students with higher total score can possibly receive lower grades than the students with lower total scores. In order to prevent confusion and maintain acceptable competition, I claim to unify the grading systems of attendance score among classes.
    Finally, I think ambiguous grading standards must be avoided. In specific lectures, it is possible to find several ambiguous grading policies not clearly explaining how grading will be. For instance, some grading policies from history lectures, there was a policy grading essay, saying ""improvements contrast to the past will be graded higher."" It is not certain how to learn or know to be better, but it only gave the students an abstract understandings. In order to lead the students to know how to improve, I think these policies are needed to be avoided as possible.
    To summarize, I personally think KAIST's grading systems have several issues to fix. Changing the grading policies for the students who are taking a lecture once more, unifying the attendance grading among different classes, and announcing clear and unambiguous grading policies would have a chance to help achieving this. As a student of KAIST, I do not think KAIST's grading system has a big flaw, but I want to say fixing several issues could make this university's standard in a higher level, and make it possible for the students of KAIST to study in a better condition."	5.0	4.5	4.5	14.0
2011	How do movies or TV influence people’s behavior? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In my opinion, movies or TV can control people's mind and make people do specific behavior because of two specific reasons.
First, movies or TV can show specific part of some incident.  Most of TV program or movies do some cutting activity to make high quality video. But some people who produce Tv program or movies can use this to control people's mind who watch these videos.  Most of people call this situation 'Devil's cutting' and they recognize this problem. For example, if directors who produce some TV program want to show specific person very bad,  they can use original video to show specific part of some situation. Then lots of people can think this person very bad because of specific part of original video.

Second, movies or TV can advertise anything. When directors or someone who want to produce movie or TV program, they need a lot of money to make their program.  So they have to find investor to produce thier TV programs or movies.  After that, directors have to find advertisement to earn money. Because of this process, movie or TV advertise something and object of advertisements can be anything such as specific person or items.  These advertisement can make people to do specific behavior or have specific mind. For example, if famous TV program or movies advertise some items such as clothes, smart phones, or anything,  it can increase these item's revenue. 


To sum up, TV or movies can make people to do specific behavior and to have specific mind. Advertisement and cutting original video can cause this and already lots of problems about this exist."	3.0	3.5	3.5	10.0
1714	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" As the IT technology had been developed, the number of people who use smartphones are increasing rapidly. Smartphones are convenient because we can do things as much as the computers do, so many people buy new smartphones. However, smartphones have not only advantages but disadvantages. I think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends for three reasons.
 First, smartphones made the individualism spread widely. When smartphones were not popular, which means there were few people who use smartphones, most people communicated face-to-face one another because it was the only way to communicate. Although there were telephones, they were not convenient to use because we should use them at designated places. Therefore, people should meet together to communicate. On the other hand, as the smartphones became popular, people don't need to meet one another now. As a result, the opportunities to talk each other decrease, so we can say that smartphones destroyed communication among family and friends. Next, most teenagers prefer using smartphones to communicating one another because it is convenient and comfortable. Let's consider how teenagers think about the relationship between each other. Most of them think that it is hard to make. They are not comfortable to communicate one another because they grew up with watching YouTube or playing games, not doing hide-a-seek or riding seesaw at the playground. So, we can say the smartphones - in fact, not only smartphones but TV or such electronic devices - have destroyed communication among family and friends. Lastly, there are so many materials that we can enjoy with our smartphones. When smartphones were less developed, which means they don't have many abilities as now, we couldn't take a rest or do something with smartphones. We could only call another or send a message because those were the only abilities that smartphones could do. However, nowadays, we can do SNS , watch videos, search articles, and listen to music as much as we want. The things we can do with our smartphones are not limited.  In fact, we can do anything with smartphones for all day long. Do you know what does it mean? We don't want to communicate among family and friends because doing something with using our smartphones is more convenient and comfortable than communicating one another. Therefore, we can say that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends because of the abilities of themselves.
 In conclusion, it is true that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends. Smartphones made the individualism spread, teenagers prefer smartphones to playing outside, and people use themselves because of their abilities. It is good to use smartphones, but it would be better to make a time to communicate among family and friends. Communicating one another make you happier than using smartphones alone."	3.5	4.0	3.5	11.0
720	A friend of yours has received some money and plans to use all of it either to go on vacation or to buy a car. Which would you suggest? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.	"It is very controversial problem that whether to go on a vacation or to buy a car when some money has been received. Some people think that to go on a vacation is more meaningful than to buy a car, but I will suggest that to buy a car is better choice to a friend for a following reasons.
 First of all, buying a car can also be the solution for going on vacation. It means that we can go on a trip by a car in later. It helps for saving a lot of money and time when going on a vacation in the future. So I think buying a car first, then using it for travel later is more efficient than just going on a trip. 
 Secondly, car is neccessary to our lives. We encounter a lot of situations that we should move to another place, such as go to school or work. And these situations usually happen every day of our lives, so car is useful when go to another place which is far from home. Despite of this reason, some people argue that we can use other vehicles like public transportaion or taxi without driving a car. However, using other vehicles is too inconvenient to move everyday. In case of public transportation, we should go to the station and it consumes additional time. And taking a taxi can be a more better solution, but it costs a lot to use everyday. Thus buying a car is the best option for a friend.
 In conclusion, I will suggest that buying a car is better choice than just going on a vaction. I feel like this because a car can be used for a travel in the future, and it makes more money and time-efficient trip. Also, car is very useful in everyday lives, so at least one of car is needed. To sum up, if you have received some money and have a problem whether to go on a vacation or to buy a car, then buy a car right now! It will be the best choice."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5

victim doesn't.

Second, Korean's law has many holes. Smart people can use these holes. They can do anything by using these holes. We can see a lot of examples in Korean

1989	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think there are 3 reasons that people travel. 
First of all, the advantage of travel is giving people free from daily life. Many people are so tired because of their daily life. In daily life, students have a lot of things to study, and workers have many works. So, traveling is a chance to refresh themselves and take a rest. 
Second, traveling is visiting new wonderful space. Usually, people go trip  to famous space which they have not been to and which are wonderful and beautiful. 
Visiting new space can give a new scene and new feel to people. I think these are reasons that people travel. 
Third, traveling with my friends and family is very exciting and fun. Generally when i was playing with my friends, we just eat food together and play game and go cafe. But, traveling with friends is not common. So, this can be a good memory to me and friends. For example, In summer vacation, I went national train trip with my friend. As we go many places, we can do many things. I think this trip is special because of my friend. 
In sum, Free from daily life by travel, visiting new space and new things, and traveling with good people are the reasons that i think people travel. "	3.0	2.5	3.0	8.5
1360	In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good friend? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" When we live, we need many people for us. Friends are very important for many reasons like we can talk each other, play with friends, or do other things. So it is important to have a good friends. I think there are some qualities of good friends. Now, I will write about some qualities that good friends should need.

 First of all, friend and me should understand each other about difference. Everyone is different in some ways like opinion or other things, so there can be trouble between friends and me. But if me and my friend understand each other, there would be no problem. And we can develop our weakness from talking about each other. Then, we would be a good person. So I think it is important to undestand each other.

 Second, there should be some similar hobby between us. If we have same hobby, we can enjoy that hobby together and we can be more close. Also we can talk about that hobby more deeply so we can have more fun about it. For example, if me and my friend play same computer game, it will be more fun when play that game together. So I think it is good to have simmilar hobby with friends.

 Last qualities that I think of a good friend is kindness. If someone is not kind, other people may not want to have close relationship with him. And if we become a friend who is not kind, we can be like him because we spend a lot of time with friend. If we become a friend who are very kind, we can be more kind like him. So I think kindness is important qualitiy of good friend. 

  In this paragraph, I wrote about three qualities of a good frineds. Of course there are more other qualities that good friend should need, but I think these qualities are the most important thing to be good friends."	3.5	3.5	3.0	10.0
2037	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There has been a very big change about the courses that we take in the college. It is that we take our classes through internet, to avoid critical damage from corona virus. Students no longer look for the classroom for each class, but get into the link that is provided from each professor who prepares his course. Today, let me tell you about some advantages that taking online courses gives students. 
 First of all, students can take classes in comfortable area such as home and dormitory. Also, they can choose the place to take classes such as library, which was not a proper place for students to be in during the class. So it is much better to focus on the lecture, not being limited about the place, clothes, friends. For example, if we take classes in real classroom, we should take some care about our appearances such as clothes. However, the online courses make students free from those complex things that makes us uncomfortable, not related to studying. 
 Second, we can solve the problem about the time that takes to get to the school. Students that live far from the school should take too many time, only about to get in the classroom. But online courses let them able to take lectures not using much time to get to the school. It is much efficient way to spend time right after the classes, having our own time. If the online course system keep develops, we can solve a lot of problems that come from the difference of the circumstances for studying among the location. It can also be the basis to make the crowded colleges in capital city to spread through out the country. And the development of the online lecture system can let people have better qualified lectures through internet, which can help the level of education improve. 
 To sum up, these two are the advantages of the online courses in college. They are mostly about the circumstance to study, as the difference of the online class is about the way we take the lecture. I hope the online course system to develop so that we can go through the corona virus from making us difficult to take education. "	3.0	4.0	3.5	10.5

591	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"Human is an animal of society. During one human's lifetime, there will be a significantly large number of social interaction between people such as conflicts, debates, agreements, etc. In this viewpoint, some people say that the family is the most important influence on young adults, the other say friends are the most important influence on young adults. Each of two viewpoint is reasonable, but I agree with the latter one; friends are the most important influence on young adults.

First, we can meet a lot of friends who have different mind. This means there is higher possibility to experience more relationships between people. In relationship between people such as family, friends, or colleagues, there are a significant number of different situations. For example, planning for travel is the most common situation. Suppose that you have to plan for trip with your friends. Some of your friends may want to set the plan with the complicated schedule, and others may want to travel with direct plan in your travel place. Another example is, the MBTI test. MBTI test distinguishes people's characteristics in 16 kinds, and everyone can see what is the most similar characteristics to their's. This means, in your family, you can see only few kinds of MBTIs, whose number is same as the number of your family. However, with your friends, I can tell you that you can meet the various kinds of MBTI.

Next point is about sociality. Although some people says that the family is the most important influence on young adults in perspective of education of social characteristics, I argue that friends are the better. That's because, it is the case of young adults. I also agree with the family is one of the most important component, but it is usually in the case of infants. Think about our infants, we can easily think about the less opportunity to meet the other people; on the other hand, when we make friends, as I told above, we can have more opportunity to meet people who have different characteristics. Think about your family's conflict in decision-making. It will have the similar steps to solve the problem. In my case, when my family have different opinion in something, we usually talk about the pros for each opinion. However, when I have to talk about the different opinion with my friends, I usually thnk about not only the pros, but also the cons for each opinion. These different way to talk will be very helpful to raise our sociality.

Third, we can do a lot of experiences with friends rather than with our family. Usually the group of similar ages can have the common interests easier. For example, most of the male teenagers like to play computer games or play sports, most of the female teenagers have interests in cosmetics. Similarly, I will suggest my case about that I can talk with more variety subjects with my friends. Our parents and my younger brother don't know about the recent issue in sciences. About the recent issues in science, it is easier to talk with our friends rather than my family. Because my friends in KAIST all have the similar interests in sciences. This means that most of my friends search the recent scientific issue, and it is easier to talk about some subjects.

Today, I argued that the friends are the most important influence on young adults with three viewpoints, which are the opportunity to meet a lot of people who have different mind, sociality, and the more various experiences. With your friends, you can easily have the most valueable experience in your lifetime, and it will be your foundation about your relationship, decision in your lifetime impliedly."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0

"I want to change a university entrance examination, because students have to suffer from stress. I think it’s more important to study harder in the university rather than high school. 
First, I want to change current entrance examination policy that choose student based on grades. Entrance examination policy will consider nonsubject activity and  passion of students. In this way, students reduce their stress from higi school grades. I know this policy could have disadvatnates about fairness. Nevertheless, simply lining up students based on grades is not good way. I saw friends who didn’t well study Liberal Arts Course, but did well study their intersting majors. So, I think that studnet interest and nonsubject activity is more important than high school grades.
Second, I want to increase admission quota of university, and make strict drop out policy. Students can have more opportunity through higher admission quota, and can develop oneself through competition among students. Excessive competition negatively affects students, but it is a problem that students in Korean universities graduate too easily.
I want to make high school students have more opprotunity, and university students have more competitiveness by change som e entrance examination policy and admission quota"	3.5	3.0	3.0	9.5

Many students live in the dormitory for several reasons. Some live there because of the distance, while some of them live dorm because of the cost. Although some students want to have a chance to make friends with roommates which university make for, dormitory is, in my opinion, some kind of house for students, so students should choose their own roommates. First, there could be a trouble if a student who school assign for the student. Next, students could their own hobby or interest with roommate who chosen by them.
To begin with, students spend their own time on the dormitory, and it is important to feel comfortable on that time. People have all different own character, it is same for the students. Thus, the roommate that is not own roommate would make a significant difference between them; then, the room could not be the best place to rest and they would always fight. In my own case, I was used the random roommate 2 years ago. At the first meeting, he seems to be a good person; however, few weeks later, he was not a clean man. He took a shower once per three days and left food for a one week on the desk. The smell of the room was terrible and the room was not feeling good for me. 
On top of that, as mentioned earlier, students spend a lot of time on their dorm. Students are not a machine for studying, so they should play for a several hours then they enjoy their own time as well. At that time, roommate could be a best partner to play with. Although random roommate could have the same hobby, the possibility is too low and if they choose their roommate, then it is one hundred percent coincidence with the roommate. Also, if the roommate has different interest, he or she have to find out friends outside of the dorm; it might be a time wasting.
On the other hand, some might say that random roommates could be a opportunity to make a new friend. Because there are not that much time for playing, they can easily contact a new person without effort. However, there are so many clubs in universities and it could be the better chance than the random roommate. They have the same interest, and it could help them more familiar easily.
To sum up, it could be a hard time for students when they are not matched on lifestyle which make problem between them. Assigning is not an efficient way for students rest as well. In addition, they have lots of other manner to make a new friend. Therefore, the university are not responsible for assigning the roommate because it could make the better result if students choose."	3.5	3.5	3.5	10.5
949	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	"In most classes, attending classes is essential. Professors may want student to study hard in the lecture and to improve their abilities. But does everyone attending classes doing their work hard and improve their abilities? My answer is NO. I insist that we should give a chance to decide whether to take a class or not.
 The first reason of my opinion is the right to choose. University students are already mature enough to decide what to do for themselves. They already decided the lectures they want to take part in, so we should also give a chance to decide whether to attend or not.
 Also, those who will study hard will study hard, and those who won't study hard will not. It doesn't help to force the students who don't have any will to study to attend the class. But, the students who have great will to study hard, most of them take classes even if the professor don't force attendance.
 Lastly, there can be gifted students who already know about whole class' contents or theories. Or, the students who do that subject so well that they don't have to take the class, for example, basic courses. It is a waste of time for these students to attend lectures as essential. It is more efficient for them to study other things without attending classes at that time.
 We should give students chances to decide attending classes or not. Give them freedom of choice, and they should take responsibility. For these reasons, I insist that going to classes should be optional for students. "	3.0	3.0	3.0	9.0

If there is a chance to change the one important thing in my university, I want to change the laundry system of our dormitory. When I lived in west dormitory calls Hope lounge, laundry place not managed clean enough. After cleaning my cloth using the laundry machine, I can feel always bad smell like fungus and uncomfortable wet smell. I thought that this bad smell was absolutely my fault because usually this smell appears when cloth not enough dried well. However, even I cleaned small amount of cloth and dried as soon as possible after the cleaning, still I can feel the bad smell. There are several reason I found. First, our laundry machine is too old so that input pipeline where water through into the machine is quite a bad condition. It makes the cleaning using the dirty water. Second, some of students close the cover of the laundry machine after finishing the process. This can makes a high humid in machine and a very good environment for a fungus and other bacteria. Obviously, machine in the dormitory is more faster decreasing the ability as a too many use. However, dormitory doesn't care until the machine is broken. As a result, I want to change the laundry place location of dormitory for more comfortable to manage and replace the old machine quickly. 	4.5	3.5	4.0	12.0
1176	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"COVID-19 has changed our daily life. We never forget to wear masks, and we never
go to a place where lots of people gather. Similarly, college policies changed a lot. Colleges
started to teach students online. Some people disagree with online lecturing because they
think students can not concentrate on studies through the internet. However, in my opinion,
taking online courses in college has advantages.
First of all, online courses save both teachers&#39; and students&#39; time. Students are
allowed to listen to online courses wherever they want, such as café, house, even at the car.
So, they do not waste their time on commuting. Also, students can study while they are using
transportations. Since teachers provide videos that they record before the class, they do not
need to spend their time to make students concentrate on the lecture as on offline classes.
The second advantage of taking online courses is that it offers students a better
understating of lectures. This is because students are able to watch lecture videos again.
Using my personal experience as an example, when I miss what the teacher says during the
offline course, I have no choices but inferred the context. On the other hand, when I was
taking an online course, I can listen to the teacher&#39;s words again and again until I get the
point. This opportunity was a good chance for me to understand lectures fully.
To summarize, online courses have advantages to both teachers and students in
college because it saves their time and gives an opportunity to students to understand the
lectures. According to the reasons I mentioned above, I will take online classes, even after

COVID-19. I also recommend other students to take online courses and teachers to conduct
online classes."	4.5	5.0	4.5	14.0

1830	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I want to visit Rusia for three reasons. 
First reason is that Rusia is communism. I don't know much about communism. Beacause I experienced only capitalism for my whole life.  I know communism's definition but I don't know communism people's life styles such as how they use money. So I want to know about it.  Also, I wonder how can Rusia keep doing communism while almost every other countries are using capitalism. There are many differences between capitalism and communism. What makes Rusia to overcome that differences? It can be their land size or millitary scale.  But, I'm not sure about the answer. So while visiting many history museames in Rusia, I want to figure out it.
Second reason is Rusia's cold weather. I think playing is very important part of traveling as much as studying that country. I choose Rusia to play with snow. I like snow and cold weather very much. But nowdays in Korea, the weather is to hot. There are few snowing days in winter. Of course, It's hard to play with snow. I guess I couldn't play with snow since I was 7. Rolling up my body with snow became a wish to me. I want to make my wish come true in Rusia.
Final reason is Rusia's liqour culture. I heard that they prefer high alchol degree. They have many other kind of liqour that isn't normal in korea like bodka. I know that they have much higher alchol degree than So-Ju. In youtube and SNS many Rusians drink that liqour just like an water. I wonder it's true or not. Anyway, in Korea, I have few chance to experience that culture. So, I want to taste many kind of liqour in Rusia."	3.5	3.5	2.5	9.5
907	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"In general, universities require to choose major for students. For graduation, students should take a lot of classes and research in their major. Some university require students to take many subjects, but other require students to study specialized subject. With the progress of the knowledge, students need to take classes in many subjects for several reasons.
     First of all, society requires generality for students. Nowadays, one specialists can not make a big find. The generalist, called pi-gifted, are better than specialists for the century of 4th Industry. In the 4th industry, people can not work and research alone. Furthermore, people need to co-work for every sections. The experience to learn about many subjects will help them co-work with various majors. 
     Next, universities are not only the end of studying, but also the middle station of studying. There are graduated schools after the university graduation, and students who want to go graduated schools should search the major more. While study for many subjects related for their major, some students find new roads. With this new way for research, they go to graduated schools and become the innovative researchers. With the experience for studying several subjects, the diversity of studying will improved.
     Some argues that university should specialize students and make them memorize more knowledges. In fact, students do not have to memorize the knowledges with Google. In contrast, they need to connect the knowledges. There are so many books, articles, and researches; in this situation, even professor can not memorize that all knowledges. Human knowledge will progress rapidly, so students just need connect them and find new knowledge. 
     To sum up, university should make students to study many subjects for students future. By learning for several classes, students can be better co-worker with generality, and they have opportunities to search the new road for graduated schools. Also, they should learn how to connect different majors for new find. With study for many subjects, students can be the better workers and researchers.  "	4.0	3.5	3.5	11.0

"In our life, we can make many decisions that what we do, what I do already or what I have never done. In that choice, I prefer to try new things. I will introduce some reasons why I prefer to try new things. 
First, trying new things can be my own various experience. I cherish various experiences. It does not mean that I do something as it was in the past. What I really cherish is the experience that can be the nutrition for my future. I think various experience can be helpful to raise adapting ability when I face to unexpected things. It doesn't matter that I success or fail. Challenging to the new thing just be my experience and confidence. By trying new things, I can make many experiences that can be helpful my life.
Second, trying new things is joyful for me. I think just doing what I already do in the past can give any enjoy to my life. The life that just doing repeated things would be very boring. I want to try new things to feel delight that comes from the freshness. In my case, the thing that I try new things also bring me happy thrill and it could be the motivation to power me. 
To sum up, I prefer to try new things because I can get various experiences and I can motive for my life. Although doing only what we already do well can be useful when I need to do something well, If we don't try anything new, we cannot any experience.

Although KAIST is best university, I think it exists some problems to change. One thing I want to change about KAIST is homework. So, I will talk about reasons to choose this. 
 First, homework in KAIST is a lot. Professors give us one homework everyweek. But, since we don't listen just one class, we have many homeworks to submit. For example, I can't usually sleep these days because I should write two essays for General Physics and General Chemcial Experiment in week. 
 Second, homework is so difficult. In order to solve homework, we should study about contents. However, homework is so difficult, as well as contents that we learn is so difficult. So, we should study a lot of times to know contents and solve homeworks. For example, I studied 10 hours in week in 2020 fall semester to solve Physics 2 homework. Also, because there are other subjects' homeworks, I should study without holiday. 
 To sum up, students are doing a lot of homeworks without rest. So, I want to reduce homework's amounts. And I want to make the policy to  increase gradually by raising ages. Then students can adapt and study well in our university."	5.0	4.5	3.5	13.0
611	If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. 	"Nowadays almost of businesses use numerical workers. Therefore, in the employer's perspective, hiring employee is very important problem. People keep argue which worker is better between lower salary inexperienced worker and higher salary experienced worker. Although hiring inexperienced worker is cheaper than hiring experienced worker, i might hire experienced worker. There are several supporting reasons.

The most essential reason that we need to hire experienced worker is effectiveness. The reason employer employ worker is business. They want to earn more money more comfortably by hiring workers. However, its hard to solve this hope by hiring inexperienced worker. Employer need to educate inexperienced worker longer than experienced worker. Since employer concentrate in educating worker, effectiveness decreases.  Therefore, effectiveness of work can not be improved.

In addition to effectiveness, hiring inexperienced worker is too risky. For the case of experienced worker, they might be a expert of this work and successfully adapted in this world. In contrast, inexperienced worker never experienced this work and society. Therefore, hiring them has risk that new workers are bad at work or fail to adapt at company.

Nevertheless, some people still believe hiring inexperienced worker is better because there salary is cheap. However, by the low effectiveness and risk that inexperienced worker give bad impact to company. We can't say hiring inexperienced worker is cheaper.

As aforementioned paragraphs clearly delineate, hiring experienced worker is better than the other one. Nowadays, one by one person is very precious and important. Therefore, we should hire worker more"	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0

"Since I was in highschool, I have thought about the topic many times. I started recognizing that there are many problems in my country at that time. Among the problems in my head, the worst is division between male and female. If I can change one thing, I want to solve polarization between them. In my opinion, it is useless in every way.
First, division between gender causes many society conflict. In fact, a lot of gender problems occured for several years. These made gender conflict harder, and the amount of people who argued with the topic increase. However, there are not any proper logic in their fighting. They just divide male and female into two teams. 
Second, gender conflict interrupt the development of our country. Any conflict can stop cooperation, so we can't proceed for our goals. In addition, some of people make the other gender enemy. It can make the quantity of marriage decrease.
I know there are many gender discrimination. But it is not correct that one-side should be responsible about the discrimination. We can solve those with considering differences between male and female."	2.5	2.0	2.0	6.5

"As an undergraduate student, I have expierenced lots of professors with very different class policies, and I believe that going to classes should be optional for student. 
First the class atomshpere would be better, if we only have self-motivated student.  As a student, my personal experience from the class which does not require attendance is actually better, because people are not afraid of asking questions with small amount of people, and I am also easily motivated by the enthusiatic professor and student. Besides, professor would not willing to watch the sleepy students from class, and it can badly affect the class quality, 
Second, pre-recored videio is easier to manage time not only for the student and but also for the professor. There are several reasons that someone might wants to have the class at the other time. If we are not able to attend a class on time, it is always better to have a backup plan. Student might also have various style of learning - someone might have better result from taking the lecture, but also someone might tends to read the text book rather than listening to professor. 
Last but not least, checking and maintaing the attendance score for everyone spend plenty amount of time . It can be a burdern for teaching assistnant and professor, and I firmly blieve that thoes time and effort should be saved for having class with better quality. 
There are always tradeoff to have one distinct rule for everything, and from the above reasons, I believe having flexible attedance policy would help instructor and student to maintain a better quatlity of class."	3.0	4.0	3.5	10.5

"My country is Korea and every young man in Korea go to army. So, if I can change one important thing in our country, I would like make no young man go to army.
 There are several reasons why I think like that.
 First, since technologies are improved, it is useless to have a lot of troops in the army. 
 Nowadays, technologies are developed and a lot of strong weapons like missile, submarine etc are made. We don't need to use a lot of people to use these weapons. We just need some people who operate them. So, I think it is useless to have a lot of troops in the army. 
 Second, a lot of problems and accidents are made by the system which makes young man in Korea go to army.
 We can see the news like 'In army, some soliders hit other solider and he get serious injury' or 'One solider shoot gun to other solider' etc. It shows that a lot of problems and accidents are made by young man go to army. Some people say these are very special case and almost every people don't have problems and accidents like that. However, there are more problems and accidents that happens which are not in the news and there are a lot of people get damaged by accidents like that. So, a lot of problems and accidents are made by the system which makes young man in Korea go to army.
 Third, I think already a lot of people think young man don't need to go to army. 
 For example, the time young man must go to army is decreasing. 20 years ago, young people should go to army for 2 year and 3 month, and 10 years ago, young people must go to army for 1 year and 9 month, and now, young people must go to army for 1 year and 6 month. It shows that a lot of people think it is meaningless to spend time in the army.
 In conclusion, if I can change one important thing in our country, I would like make no young man go to army because, since technologies are improved, it is useless to have a lot of troops in the army, and a lot of problems and accidents are made by the system which makes young man in Korea go to army, and I think already a lot of people think young man don't need to go to army.

This is proper method because reduction of risk and we just want safety way. I also following this method, but I prefer to try new things and take risks. Here are some reason why.
First, No risks, no returns; If we do something already do well is doing just what i know. Thus, we cannot upgrade our experiment skills. For instance, Car driving. Suppose that you get driver's license yesterday. If you do not practice driving, you can't drive your car. but try practicing with risk, you can get more better driving skills.
Second, We can achieve self-propelled person. While living on this world, we must have interact a lot of unexpected situation. When we crush on this with self-propelled skills, can solve problem easily and wisely. By the way, which person only do they already do well will meet various problems.
Finally, You cannot grow variable way. Just stay on your step. For example, there is two people which one is willing to go Bungee Jump, and other one is afraid of jumping. Also those people is the first time of Bungee Jumping. The first one can get some physical sense and ability while other one just stay on his step.
Trying new things can make you to more dynamic and outgoing person. Do not hesitate, just do it. But if you think 'safe' Firstly, you can just on your step. Make your choice."	4.0	3.5	3.5	
1178	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In 2020, because of COVID-19, there are big changes in many countries and in many
cultures. One of all changes is the method of classes in universities. Many colleges avoid spreading
COVID-19, so they start many classes in online classes. Students take online courses in spring
semester, and they say that online courses are good. Then what are the advantages of taking online
courses?
There are two main reasons about advantages of taking online courses. First of all is
students take a time efficiently. The classes are divided into two methods. One is live streaming, and
another is just recording video lectures. In the case of recording video lectures, students watch the
lectures and just do assignments for their classes before due date. On the other hand, in live
streaming, students participate in the class on time, but the time of class is not so long. Therefore,
they use their time freely.
Second, students study more convenient. In online classes, many video lectures are
uploaded in website. Therefore, when students miss the contents of classes, they just click a time
table and back to what they miss. They also submit all assignments in websites. This makes easy to
upload for students and to feedback from professors. My friends said, “Online courses are fortune for
me! I have trouble in chemistry when I was high school student, but in online courses I can study well
because I repeat the lectures when I want to see.”
There are many advantages of taking online courses in college except above. Although
many students miss offline classes and campus of university, they satisfy online courses. Many
problems in online courses are exist yet. If universities revise problems and make better online
courses, online courses are to be a new culture of studying not only now, but also after COVID-19."	4.5	4.5	3.5	12.5

  Many people wants to travel abroad if they have chance. Especially because of Covid 19 people cannot travel freely, so they wants to travel more. I am the one of the person who wants to travel. There are many good countries such as Japan, USA, England. However, if I have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks, I will visit Germany for three reasons.
  First of all, there are some people who can speak English. In abroad, emergency situation can occur. In emergency situation, conversation is very important because I can explain what happens and what I need. It would be very embarrasing, if I cannot talk with others in those situations. Moreover, it would be very conveneient in daily life if I can talk with others. I can also meet foreign friends have nice conversation. It will let me have special memory. 
  Another advantage of visiting Germany is that I can go to other countries in Europe by train. I want to experience many countries because I don't have many chance to go Europe. I can eat foods in diverse countries and visit places with beautiful sight. I can also experience tradition of each countries and see famous structures. 
  In addtion to speaking English and visiting other countries, I want to visit Germany since Germany is famous for preserving environment. There is a well-known eco-friendly city, Frizenbrook(?) where people use eco-friendly energy. The city also have eco-friendly laws, and it works by participation of citizens. I know the city  due to my assignment, and I am very interested about the city. I want to visit the city, and see how the city looks like. 
  For these reasons, I want to visit Germany if I have opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. I can speak English in Germany, visit other countries by train, and see eco-friendly cities. I really hope to have the opportunity to travel. "	3.5	3.0	3.5	10.0
2109	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" I was very confused when I become a college students and come college. Because in the high school, I was so busy that I always have something to do, but after i become a college student I have so much time to spend and I can't spend the time more efficiently. So I always think what should I do for the resting time and for the hobby. After the long thinking, I finally got one answers.
 I think going trip with people who I really like and who are very important to me. There are three reasons why I think this is the best hobby for college students. 
 First reason is that in the high school,  especially we didn't spend our time for our family. When I was 17years old by Korean age, my grandfather became 80 years old. In Korea 80years old is very important. So our family and cousins are prepared for the trip with my grandfater and mother, however I was trying my best to get better score. So I can't go there. Now, I am very regretful about that trip. I always think I had to go there for our family and my grandfather to make some memory about us. And also my family always said that if I was there , it could be better trip for everyone. So I think the college students who have much time should go trip with their family to make some memory before they regret about this.
Second reason is we are fully grown. When we were young, it was hard to walk longer, and if the weather is too hot or the weather is too cold, then we become angry and didn't follow our parents order. So it was very hard trip for our parents. But now, we are fully grown and we can help our parents and if we go for trip, It must be the better trip. In my case, my father always said that his wish is 'if you become abult, let's go trip and drink some beers with me.'. So what I want to say is now it is time to help our parents and just stay beside them and drink some beers! All of your parents must want to take trip with you.
Third reason is when we go for trip, we can earn some expensive experience that we can't get. If we always in the college and sit front of desktop, the amount of  informations and experiences that I can earn is very little and limited. However with trip for some new place and some place that I want to go and some place for earn information,  we can get better experiences and informations and also the amount is almost unlimited. In my experiece, I had been museum with my friends. While I was going, it was hard and I couldn't understand why my friends wanted to go there. However after the museum tour, my new information about pictures and drawings become much larger than before and I can earn the experiences that I couldn't get if I was in the room all day.
With these reasons, I think going for trip is the best hobby for college students and I recommend to you if you have time to go trip."	4.0	3.0	3.0	10.0
1230	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"I think there are two advantages for online course.
First, students can repeat the lecture.
In KAIST, most of lectures use 'English' in class. So, many students can't understand major principles or ideas of class at once they heard. Also, most of lecture notes those used in class are also written by English. If student would get that lecture notes, and if they could read the lecture notes again and again, there would be no problem. But, in offline class, some professors just show it once at class, and didn't share it. It's also hard to understand English lecture notes at once.
By using KLMS, online platform of KAIST, online class can provide two thing. One is repeatable lecture videos and the other thing is repeatable lecture notes. In case of lecture notes, students could get lecture notes although it is offline class, but it would be more comfortable to use online platform to get it. These two things would be very helpful for students to understand lecture much better.
Second, Direct Lecture
In offline class, some student can't see the board because of their bad eyes, location of seat or etc. So, some student can't focus on class by these problems. But, if online class use real-time online platform like ZOOM, these problems can be solved.  Sharing professor's screen and writing down on lecture notes, is more helpful to students to focus on lecture. and it would be helpful to understand lecture easily.  it is also good for professors.
There would be more advantages of online classes. "	4.0	3.0	4.0	11.0
980	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Taking Risk is Best Choice in Life
    Large return always contains Large risks. Risk caring is one of the most important factor which can makes more profit. This can be used in life. In life, there is various chance which can makes dreams come true or makes a lot of money. I believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances for several reasons.
    First of all, every choices have risks, and risks contain value of choices. There are various chances which can change whole life. These chances require using time, money, and power of human. These demerit is looks like can be a huge problem in life. However, this chance can be a last chance to reach a goal of life. A plan cannot give anything which are not in purpose.
    In addition, taking risk is challenge of life. All plan have difficulties that have to oversee the future and fix choices for best efficiency. When making a plan, future ability cannot be affect correctly. However, future is not fixed; therefore, a plan always changed in life. Plan can not be a solution of life as the result of future diversity. Choosing more valuable choice can deliver more benefits to entire life.
    Lastly, taking risk is more flexible to care problems in life. Someone says, ""A perfect plan consider all huge problems in life, and following this plan is very effective."" However, in life, there is various accidents. Not enough money makes going university difficult, and not enough time makes getting score difficult; a plan that did not think humans ability cannot achieve the goal of life. Choosing best choice at each problem can be a solution.
    To sum up, taking risk gives more chance to achieve a goal by it's large return, more whole return in life, and flexibility. Nobody knows future. A human can prepare only individual ability, and get chances by these ability."	4.5	4.5	4.0	
1991	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, you may have heard your friends saying, ""I want to travel to somewhere after Covid-19!"" Why do people really like traveling and want to travel? Let me give you reasons why people travel.
     First, they are very tired of daily life. Usually, our life is repeating. Today is similar to yesterday and tomorrow will be similar to today. And this pattern can give people stress and make people want to get out of this pattern. Traveling can be a good solution for this. So, traveling can give good feeling because they are out of their usual life.
     Second, traveling is a good experience. Sometimes people grow up with experiences. This means, after they experience something, they can notice or learn something. Travel can be a good experience too! For example, I went to Hawaii when I was 16 years old, and I saw a farm which is used in 1910s. Seeing that and listening to explanation of that farm, I could understand how our ancesters lived and what they would felt in those times. I noticed that we should remember them and their hard life.
     Finally, traveling is good for the relationship. There is a survey that says ""After the travel, relationship with friends who people travel with became good for almost 70%."" During the travel, people can be with other people who are traveling with them for the long time, so they can talk more and make some good memories with them. It gives a good effect on relationship between them.
     To sum it up, I think people like to travel for these three reasons. So, if you want to experience something good, make some good relationship, or want to go out of daily life, I recommend you to travel to somewhere!"	4.0	3.5	4.0	11.5
597	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"  Of all discussions that surface in contemporary society, the debate over which is the most important influence on young adult among family and friends is controversy. Although some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults, I think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. There are several reasons can support my thinking.
  First, many young adults usually spend much more time with their friends than family. Young adults can leave their home when they are accepted in college or employed in company. Moreover, they located far away from their family when they go to another regions to study or work. In this sequence, they should interact more time with their friends and coworker, but they could not interact much time with their family. This phenomenon decrease family's influence on young adults and increase friend's influence on young adults.
  Second, when they entered in new society, and they can approach to new thing that can change them. Once they grow to adult, they can feel freedom because barriers that they can't enjoy in their childhood are broken. And then, they approach to sensational thing when they couldn't study and feel. In addition, in almost case, friends are near by young adults, not family. It is because they interact many time with their friends.
  Lastly, they would like to tell their worries and determination to friend, not their family. Young adults have behaviors to hide their consideration to their parents and brothers(or sisters) because they passed away their childhood. So it makes they are want to interact their friends, not family.
  In conclusion, young adults can be influenced more by friends than family because they spend more time with their friends and they not want to share their consideration with their family. "	4.0	4.0	3.5	11.5
509	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"A Small Number of Students
Recently, the debate on the form of giving college education is rising. Some claim that every student should have the opportunity, on the other side, others declare that it should focus on the outstanding students. Despite the claims that a college or university education should be available to all students, it should be available only to good students. 
First of all, it is economically efficient to manage a small number of students. Financial support for college life is the surest way which helps students. Given that the expenditure on laptops and food is very high, it is natural that additional college financial support for students is made so that students can focus solely on learning. By considering the limited financing of school is distributed samely among the students, supporting a small number of students can provide sufficient or more support. 
In addition to economic efficiency, focusing on small numbers can cultivate elite leaders. The momentous person in the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution is a great leader, who leads the society. Usually, one of the factors related to the quality of learning is the number of students per professor. For example, in the case of general liberal arts lectures, as many as 300 students are taught by one professor; thus, the quality is naturally lower than that of one professor teaching to five students. Hence, teaching a small number of students, these situations will overlap, and in the end, individual students will have outstanding competencies.
Some argue that everyone has freedom of education, so they insist college or university education should be available to all students. It may be true that if no other form of education was considered. University is a place to create good talent, but it is not the only place to gain expert knowledge. Anyone can listen to public lectures such as K-mook, for example, and anyone with the will can obtain specialized knowledge of the university through educational services. 
To sum up, college education should be supported to a small number of talented students. This approach is more economically efficient than the way of educating everyone, and it can create strong talent. In addition to the university, there is also a window for the general public to listen to education, which prevents worry about when this method is implemented. Therefore, all university facilities will have to seriously consider the policy of raising a small number of elite students."	4.5	4.5	4.5	13.5
1034	Lifestyles: Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"I prefer to try new things and take risks. But in fact, I have both sides and the precentages of the degree how much I have that characteristic are 0.55 for taking risks and 0.45 for trying only what I already do well. It's almost similar.
The reason that I prefer to try new things little bit more is that I enjoy escaping normal life. I had trip to Jeju island alone when I was 20. It's not normal to travel alone for young girl, because it can be dangerous. So there are other options such as travel with family or friends. But I desire to have new experience! As a result, it was nice time and I could learn rich things and get wide choices on future.
The second reason is that I want to be special and be first case. It's also because I have 'Just do it!' mind.  For example, I graduate science high school and it was very riskly choice. I was born small country, so there is no past case to enter science high school from my hometown. There is no related acamedy and no teacher to get advice. So many friends was entered normal school and get normal courses. But I felt boring with normal classes that did not consider students' participation or interest. So I want to join special school that can cover my academic interest. Some people can think entering science high school is not new thing, but for my perspective, it's new attempt not just for me, but my middle school and my hometown city. It has big risks such that I cannot follow ciriculum because I didn't study high school course or university course, but many science high school students already learned these. Also I leaved familiar environment and tried to find new friends. But I chose riskly choice and make an example on my hometown. By this choice, many students in my middle school start to enter science high school.
For these reasons, I prefer to try new things. Like two examples, I have other choices that hase no risks. If I travel with friends it might be safe. And If I enter normal high school, I could get high grades easily and not waste time to get familiar with new environment. But I choose riskly choices."	3.0	3.0	2.5	
1627	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	Due to the COVID-19, many schools including colleges are having online courses to prevent the disease. Since this was a quite rare experience, many students were able to know some advantages of taking online courses. In my opinion, the advantages of taking online courses are that we have opportunities of better understanding of the courses and also we are able to save time and energy. First advantage I thought was that having online courses provided us the opportunities of better understanding of the courses. This can be in many ways. First, until today, we had to go to the classroom in the right time. However, since the time we take the course became comparatively flexible, we could take the courses whenever our thoughts are clear, rather than listening to the lecture from the early morning with not-awakened brain. Second, since many of the lectures are done through the online video, it became much more easier to take time to have note-taking, or think again about the stuffs that we are struggling with. Last, although it may be similar to the second reason, it became easier to search about things that we don't know quickly through the Internet, since the lectures are online. Second advantage is that we can save time and energy. In school, we have to move the classes frequently to take the different classes. Especially for the college, many classrooms are in different buildings, which takes so much time. This is not only linked to the time problem, but also to the energy problem. There is only small limited time to move between the classes, so after we move, sometimes we get too exhausted to concentrate for the next class. All these problems are not going to happen through the online courses, so isn't it beneficial to have online courses that will save your time and also the energy to study? Sure, having online courses can disturb students from making a lot of new college friends, or it can also make them lazy. However, there are a lot of benefits like these from having the online courses. So, don't be so gloomy that you are not able to enjoy your campus life, but think positively that this is the chance for you to experience a lot of new things by yourself and earn the rich knowledge.	3.5	3.0	3.5	10.0
1144	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"This year many schools started to lecture with online circumstance because of the COVID19
breakout. I think teaching students with online video is much better than lecturing students in a
traditional classroom.
First, we can listen to the lecture wherever whenever we want. As I experienced in latest semester,
taking class without any limits are great advantages. According to my personal experience, I spent my
time on the bus when I move to another places I spent my time on the bus by listening to Happy
Campus Life lecture. So I was able to save my time while I take the lecture on bus which is impossible
under the traditional teaching system.
Second, we can listen to the lecture as many as we want. Online video lectures allow us to retake the
class without number limitation. For example in my case, I used to watch biochemistry videos again
and again because the lecture was too hard to understand straightly at once for me. It was really
helpful for to understand biochemistry clearly. I am sure that lots of students wants to listen
professors’ description again when they are confusing about particular concepts.
To sum up, I believe that most of students will prefer video lecture which gives more choices. Also I
think giving a video lecture will improve students’ abilities because they will use advantageous of
videos lecture that I mentioned above."	4.0	3.0	2.5	9.5

 We meet many people in our lives. We can meet people at schools, clubs, offices and so on. But we can be lonely without real friends. Because most of people we meet are not friendly that much. Then what are the qualities  of a good friends?
 First, you can share your feelings with them in sincere. I think it is the most important thing of good friends. when you are in sad mood, they can understand your feelings and they will make your feeling better. Also, they can worry about you in sincere.
 Second, they help you without rewards. when you are in danger or you need help immediately, good friends will help you and give you a good advice. These helps and advices can make you solve the problem. In my experience, when I was thinking about my future job, my friends' advice was very helpful. Like this, it is very nice that good friends help each other.
 Last, you can develop with your friends by comparing each other. If you study with your friends, you can learn more faster and easier by discussing some ideas. Of course, extremely comparing with your peers is not good for both of you and your friend. But with your friend you can get will to study more hard and it will help you in long term.
 A lot of people want to make many friends but I think it is more important to make a real good friend who can be with you whole life. "	3.0	3.5	3.0	9.5
765	Education: Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Two Benefits of Group Studying

    There are many students who prefer to study with a group of students. It's popular way to study hard, but also some students don't prefer to study with others.  It's hard to say which way is much better. However, I prefer to study with group because of two benefits. This essay will talk about why I prefer to study with a group of students.

    First, Study with group help students to share their knowledge. Group studying can help students to teach them each other. If someone confused how to solve problem, may be other student can help. They can share their knowledge, and it makes their group can get a good grade in exam. Also, students can share information about exam. Group can have more information than students who don't have group, and it makes group can prepare exam condition.

    Second, Study with group makes them work hard. Sometimes, study makes student get tired. Even though they have important exam, they can't work hard without passion. Group students can help each other overcome tireness. Then, they can work hard for a long time and it makes a good result in exam. In addition, someone who doesn't work hard in group will be excepted. If he want to get benefit of group studying, he should keep work hard. It will be connected to good results in exam.

    In conclusion, Studying with group have two benefits. First, studying with group makes them share knowledge. For example, they can share how to solve specific type of problem, or the concepts of exam. Second, group studying make them keeping work hard. They can cheer up each other. Also, they should work hard for keep one sheet of group. For these reasons, I prefer to study with a group and I want to many people study"	2.5	3.0	2.5	8.0
197	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Studying is a hard work. Many people study for various reasons and in different ways. There are people who prefer studying alone. Studying alone has some advantages such as possibility to focus on the point and to develop the skills of studying. However, I prefer studying alone because of the two benefits, possibility to notice errors and encouraged studying by others.
  First of all, I can know what I knew incorrectly by studying in group. When we study in groups, we usually discus each other about the knowledge we know. In this process, individuals talk about what they know about the topic. When someone says the incorrect information other will argue that one is wrong, and they will argue about that point. Because they are in group, usually person who said wrong point will understand that he or she was wrong, so he or she can correctly know about that point, and this is important in learning something. I believe correcting one wrong knowledge is better than learning three new knowledge but finding out what I know incorrectly is too hard to do alone. Therefore, I think it is a huge advantage to notice errors in studying, so this is the one reason I prefer studying in group.
 More importantly, I can focus on studying better when I study in group. When I study alone, I often loss my concentration during study, and do some other things which are not related to studying. However, studying in group helped me prevent losing concentration because other people are studying and I care that they can watch at me. I realized this effect when I was in high school. At my high school, many students study together in the same room and we can also use the small rooms if the student wants to study alone. I used to study alone at the first time, but I could not study well. Therefore I tried using the big room studying in groups of students. After changing the studying type, I could fully focus on my studying, and the grade became better too. Because I experience how studying in group can change my concentration, I know that is the best way of studying way for me.
 To sum up, studying together in group seems much efficent than studying alone for me because of the advantage in correcting wrong knowledge and more concentration earned. I have experience these benefits when I studied to attend KAIST, and I am sure that studying in group can help me achieve bigger goals in my life of studying. "	3.5	3.5	4.0	11.0
1681	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"
          KAIST, one of the best university in Korea is in Daejon.  So, most of the KAIST students have to live in Daejon more than 5 years. Of couree Daejon is good city, but if I could change on thing form KAIST, I want to replace KAIST Seoul from Daejon for three reasons.
          First , Daejon and Seoul have huge difference between acceibiilty to other cultures and  doing activities. Many famous musicians do their concert only in Seoul. For example, Psy, IU and AKMU concerts are held in Seoul, but Daejon did not. Not only for concerts, many festivals are held only in Seoul. Also, Seoul has many cities like  Sinchon, Hongdae or Itaewon ,which has  their own characterestics. live in Seoul can have various experiences than Daejon.
          Second, there are many college in Seoul, but Daejon do not. KAIST students mostly study Industry or nature science. So meeting other students is very helpful for KAIST students. But there are not enough college in Daejon compare with Seoul. If KAIST move to Seoul, it will be easier to do interactive with other college students. I hope KAIST students meet various people.
          Finally, university in Seoul will increase the name value of KAIST. For above reasons, many korean students want to go university in Seoul.  So, In-Seoul university title will increase the value of KAIST. It wll make more people can know the name of KAIST.
          As a conclusion, I want to replace KAIST to Seoul for three reasons. there are individual reasons, but all opinion will be helpful for KAISTIAN'h happiness and pride. I want KAIST students experience many activities and culture. Daejon is also a good city, but silence city than Seoul. So, it will beb etter if KAIST replace to Seoul."	5.0	4.0	3.5	12.5

     I wish that our university has mentor program. Mentor program is that all students have their mentor in their university. In fact, in Korea University has mentor program and I heard about this from my friends who are students of Korea University. They say it is very good program, and I also think this program is good for students.

     First reason is students can make friends in this program. If you have a mentor, you can be friendly with your mentor. In additional, you can meet your mentor's friends and become good friends. If you make many friends,  you can enjoy your university life with your friends. 

     Second reason is students can get information about our university, their major and some tip for student who is freshman.  Many students do not have information about those. If they have mentor, they can know some information. Therefore, they can enjoy university life more easily.

     Finally, mentors can also grow up with their student. They also can make friend with student and student's friends. They study some information about that they do not know about that in order to give this information to their student. Therefore, mentors also 
can gain something, so it is good for mentors and their student.

     In conclusion, I think this program is very good. Therefore, if our university has this program, students can be more happy and friendly and more love our university. Then, I hope that our university has mentor program."	5.0	5.0	4.5	14.5

This change is not possible, but it would be pleasure to imagine about rewriting the history.  This imagination can give motivation to know our history well, and keep bright side of it. 
At first, if we have preserved resources in Korea, economy of our country would be better. We can guess by Norway and other countries  whose GDP is high thanks for many resources. If we also had a lot of resources, we may don't need to work and study hard to have comfortable life. 
Secondly, many people  would be safe without the period. Many inocent people have dead through the period. Men had to participate the war or work for coal, and women had to go other coutries as nurses, or Jeong-Shin-Dae. These are terrible memory for them and their family. We need to know about that, and should not repeat the terrible history. 
Lastly, many sites and historical heritage will be remained.  They would help to study our history more easily and have precious time to see or visit them. We should try to get back the historical things from other countries and preserve them.

I think online courses in college are the biggest change for college students. We study at home by watching professors' video and take exams with Zoom. Although most of college students adapt to this online courses, the controversial issue 'Online classes are good or bad' still remain. I will talk about the advantages of taking online courses in college on this essay. There are two big reasons to support my opinion.
First, college students can spend much free time compared with the offline courses period. We can move classes with one click, so there are no commuting time. For my experience, I can study Python programming additionally on spring semester. If I were in KAIST on spring semester, I can't study it because of lack of time. Also, we can use this free time to take a rest. I and my friends enjoy online game a lot in spring and summer.
Second, we can spend much time to talk with our family because we have to stay at home during the online course period. I studied at dormitory high school for three years, so I can't talk with my family a lot. In my case, my family came to the school once a month. It is hard to know that 'how does my family live now' or 'what is the updated fun story in my family'. But now, I stay at home nearly 1 year and talk a lot because of COVID-19 and online courses.
This is my opinion. Of course, I agree with an opinion that there are many disadvantages of taking online courses. After this weird situation ends, I hope that KAIST accepts some advantages of online courses and builds a new great curriculum next year."	4.0	4.0	3.0	11.0
1248	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	" Covid-19, the bad virus for human health, changed our life. So, we got a online courses instead of face-to-face class. It is the first time that we use non face-to-face class. But online courses gave some advantages for us. Let's see about that.

 First, There are more freely to student, TA, and professor. When we take a face-to-face class, we should prepare for clothes, hair condition, make-up, and so on. But after we take a  online courses, we just check about our camera, microphone, and more comfortable clothes. It can improve our class-attention and make more short time to prepare. 

 Second, We can get some information more easily during class. When we get a question or some specific vocabulary, it makes us hard to understand about what we are going to learn. However, If we take a online courses, we just make one more internet page and search something very quickly. So, We can get some information quickly without class-flow breaking. In addition, TA and professor can give us some useful information by hyper-link, PPT files, and video.



 Third, We can get more time to improve ourselves.  When we take a face-to-face class, there are some loss-time that we go to classroom for next course. But, When we use online systems to take a courses, there are no wasting time to move next class. Just click or chat next class' URL. So, We can get more free time to relax or improve ourselves than face-to-face class.



 Because of unusual type class, somebody may confuse about online courses. But as I mentioned before, there are so may benefits to take a online courses. Unfortunately, Covid-19 is still yet. But how about advantages of online courses? Isn't it worth for our study? When Covid-19 is gone, I think mixing face-to-face class with online courses' advantages will be the best way to study for us."	3.5	4.0	3.0	10.5
1955	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  In my opinion, good hobby for college students is  a self-growing materials. For example, exercising, playing piano, and even playing games. You can agree with follwing reasons.
  First, collage students are steps that are just before live social alone. Being an adult is difficult mission. We meet new people, associated in new sytem, and have to decide whole our life in collage. If we don't prepare our living strategys and living base, It could be hard to live after graduation.
  Second, Just having  deep-interesting hobby is good to our living. As I proposed above ""playing games"" for example, it can be self-growing material. I'm not saying about just playing games. It must be professional. In my case, I analyse after the game about winning or losing reasons. Then, I set a ""concept to win"" and cirtify by myself. It leads me to feel happy because of achievements, and also get a lot of talking topics with my friends. To sum up, It makes us to be a professional person.
  Finally, we can be attractive person. We all attracts to ""Hard-doing person"". It is obvious. Therefore, we can advantage with meeting new person. It can affect to all our living to right direction.
  We've talk about why having self-growing hobby is important. However, keep in mind. The fundamental thing is doing hard with your passion!"	2.5	3.0	2.0	7.5
1051	Lifestyles: Some people prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day’s work. Others prefer to get up later in the day and work until late at night. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.	"The reasons why getting up early is better
One of the pattern of dailiy life is getting up early in the morning or getting up late in the day. Many researchers debate which life pattern is better for human and why some life pattern is better than the other. In my opinion, getting up early in the morning and startting the day's work is a better life style for several reasons.
First of all, people who get up early in the morning can be exposed to sunlight for a long time than people who get up late. Sunlight exposure is important; because, it gives not only physical energy but also mental energy. Also, sunlight has necessary viatamin such as viataminD. Sun existed about 6am to 6pm in a day; therefore, a person who get up around 6am could enjoy sunlight's benefits, but others cannot enjoy whole time. Therefore, getting up early is better to have a time with sunlight.
In addition, working until late at night is negative for the brain development. Sleep is a crucial activity; because, it is a rest time for human body and brain. During this time, the brain activity such as thinking and creativity begin to inactivity, and brain prepare tomorrow. For this reason, working at late night is not efficient and prevent brain development. Therefore, getting up early and working in the morning promotes brain development and give an efficiency of working.
Some argue that life pattern with working until late at night is more appropriate for KAIST students; however, this opinion is not a fact, and diverse counter-examples existed. In KAIST, several students do their homeworks and group activities at night is true, but diverse students who do their works in early morning also existed. They wake up early and prepare classes and schedules.
To sum up, getting up early in the morning is better than getting up later in the day. Because it gives a lot of benefits such as sunlight exposure and brain development. However, a different person has a different fit life pattern, so trying both getting up early and getting up late is important before choosing one option."	4.0	4.0	4.0	
1733	If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I will change the design of apartment. There are three reasons in my opinion. 
 First of all, The shape and color of my apartment are very similar. For example, In my case, the apartment that I live is composed of 16 floors. Next to my aparment, the other apartment is also 16 floors apartment. The color is ivory and the shape is tall and thin. So it might be a problem is that only clear standard to distinguish each apartment is the number of apartment. I think that it is too plain to feel refreshing for living people and visitor. In my hometown, there are many similar design and color of apartment. It makes people be boring to see and find each apartment. Also, all same shape of apartment can make people who want to find some apartment confuse in my hometown.
 Second, the apartment is very expensive but it is not good design. So, I think it is not responsible in terms of affordability. Of course, my hometown has a lot of useful facailities and convenient traffic situation. But It is so expensive compared to the boring and simple design. It is necessary to make different characteristic design for each apartment. For example, it might be the different colors and pictures of outside. And it could be a good idea that express the number of apartment in artistic perspective. Additionally, I want to make each special point for apartment. So, it will be a great turning point that compose our hometown.The attempt for designing apartment will make the hometown look better.
 Third, It is time to fix and remodel each apartment. Nowadays, new apartments and new schools are built in my hometown. Additionally, new faculties are built in these days. So I'm sure that it is best time to repaint our apartment. Many people that live in our hometown think that it is time to remodel the apartment. Also we have to make different something to clarify new apartment. Definitely, it is best opportunity to repaint and fix our apartment because remodeling for apartment is necessary.
 Therefore, for these three reasons, I will chage the design of apartment if I could change one important thing about my hometown."	4.0	4.0	3.5	11.5

     There are many lifestyle among people. Some people get up at early , and some people get up at late at night. In my opinion, getting up early in the morning and start the day's work has several benefits. 
     First of all, living life healthier. Sunlight is essential for human body which make Vitamin D for human body; moreover, there is a research if sunlight is lacking, it could lead to depression. A person who get up early could have enough sunlight during the day time by walking to school, running at part, and laying down at bench, which makes sufficient Vitamin D and prevents depression.
    In addition to live life healthy, Various activities are more available at day time compare with night time ; for example, climing, going swimming pool, and going piano academy. Moreover, many public facilities open at morning until evening. If getting up at early in the morning, the chance and effectiveness are increased that doing various activities and deal with works. 
   Some argue that working at night is more efficient because no one distract at night time; however, it also could be efficient at morning. Miracle morning which is famous in the world is a method that getting up early like 5'o clock  and start day with specific routine. By doing Miracle morning, people can obtain a private time that possible to focus on what they want in the day time.
     To sum up, getting up early and start the day has more benefit than waking up later.  To get up early, the life would become more healthier, possible to do various activities, and have no distraction time from everything. If keeping routine that get up early, it will leads the way how to enjoy the all day. "	4.5	4.5	4.0	
1413	If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"   In MIT, there is the ""Infinity corridor"" which connect every buldings so that you can reach anywhere just walking there. It seems like ""Endless load"" in KAIST, but the main difference is that first one is at indoor, and second one is in outdoor. In this point of the view, I want to change a little but it might be needed enormous construction. If can I change one thing about KAIST, I'm going to create another ""Infinity corridor"" at KAIST with three reasons.

   The first advantage of building those corridor is that we can prevent wet our body by heavy rain. I believe approximately all students at KAIST have soaked their shoese when they go to have lunch or dinner at freshmen. At that time, those people usually said, ""How great if we can move in corridr so that we don't need to worry about rain."" We can achieve that hope by creating the corridor which connect every building at KAIST.

   Next, we can make various friends because of these corridor. We don't visit where is not relate out department, so our network of friends is inevitably limited, However, if we can face someone who you don't know ever in many time at those corridor, we can make one more friend in those.

   Finally, just connecting several department and laboratory, we can get inspiration from where we didn't imagine. Hyun Joon Yoo, who are the professor of architecture, said ""In my opinion, infinity corridor cause MIT has lots of people who are recieved Novel Prize."" It is not amazaing someone did great work and he got impression from where seems to have no relationship with thier work. Since anyone could see what they do in other majors, they could combine those and their thinking. Therefore, it guides to higher level of creativity.

   In conclusion, if we create the second ""Infinity corridor"" at KAIST, we will catch the three point. The safe zone from rain, making various friends, and creativity. I hope those thing is created as soon as possible."	4.0	4.0	3.5	11.5
2212	If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	Since two months ago, I was in korea Marine corps. I serviced as a Marine soldier in Marine 2 divison. I approximately got an 6000,000won as a monthly wage of sergeant. But I think this wage is too low. So if I could change one thing about my country, I will change soldier's wage. Every korean man have to do military service as many other types. Most common way is working for 18~21months as a soldier. There are many classes in military but only soldiers are not getting the minimum wage. Soldiers are always staying in military except vacation different from other classes. We work for 8 hours per day and do border work alternately for 24 hours everyday. But our wage is only 1/3 of minimum wage. Everyone knows that military service is a duty and I think we have to do military service because South Korea still has threat from North Korea. But I think that if country needs people to protect country then country needs to pay enough to people who volunteer for country. So I think country needs to raise the wage of soldiers to at least minimum wage.	2.5	2.5	2.0	7.0
304	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"People have different points of view about the diversity of subjects students take. For example, some universities require students to take classes in many subjects whereas there are some others that require students to specialize in one subject. Universities which prefer specialized students in one subject argue that focusing on one subject has the advantage of having better expertise. Although the idea of ""Deep and narrow is better than shallow and wide"" is true, I prefer students to take classes in many subjects for two reasons.

  First, all subjects are connected. Students cannot succeed just because they are good at math, and students cannot succeed just because they are good at physics. When it is time to utilize the subjects students have learned, they should eventually integrate them with other subjects. For example, suppose a student only learned mechanical engineering. This student has no knowledge other than mechanical engineering, and he wants to participate in robotics research, a branch of mechanical engineering. However, since robotics is also very closely linked to biology, this student will have a lot of difficulties in the research process.

  Second, students don't know which subject is suit for them. Most majors and subjects are determined when students graduate from high school and enter university. However, young students at this time are still inexperienced and don't know exactly what they will learn in college. Universities should provide these students with more opportunities to experience and set up a system to take various subjects.  

  In conclusion, because of the connectivity of subjects and the instability of young students due to lack of experience, universities should encourage students to take various subjects. A number of students change the subjects they are learning and taking at university. Universities should reduce the time wasted unnecessarily by students' wrong choice of subjects."	4.5	5.0	5.0	14.5
1948	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	In college, many student have free, so they play with friends in the late night and they drink some beers and sojus every day. But they know it is not good for them. So they have to get a good hobby to change their life. I think the best hobby for college students is singing and listening to music. Music has a lot of powers. It can change your feeling and it can make you relax. My hobby is go to karaoke alone. It is good to erase bad mind and break up my stress. Many people love to go to karaoke, too. Of course not all of them love singing a song, some people like listening songs but they have a common to feel happy. Some music is used to cure people. For example, If you have a lot of angry, doctor gives you some tips like listening to classic music. Since of them, music can helps our college life more happy and more relax. So I think singing and listening to music are best hobby for college students.	2.5	2.0	2.0	6.5

Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.	"In my case, I prefer to do already do well. There are two reasons.
First, trying new thing is too hard to satisfy myself. When I do something, I prefer to do as many as possible on that thing. That means, I want to do all contents related to that things. But if just try new thing over and over again, I can't do all contents related to them and never to do well that things. To do something with in-completed state is worst things to me.
Second, even if I do well that things, I can find new aspects of them when doing again and again. And by repeat, I can find another pleasure of them. For example, when I play the game, I usually repeat some specific part with new strategy, method, control etc. And by these, I can experience another feelings on them. Of course, trying new things is restricted, that is, I only change some part of the familiar one. If I try totally new thing, I wouldn't know whether I can change some part of it. Therefore, I'm not going to modify anything of them.
In conclusion, because of my characteristics, and some adventure of familiar one, I choose former opinion.

943	University: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.	" It has been a long issue that whether universities should require students to take classes in many subjects or one subject. I claim that letting students take classes in various subject is a better choice.

 First, students will have more options to choose for their dreams. The majority of students in university doesn't have a job yet. They should be finding which subject will suit their aptitude. Studying many subjects will increase the possibility to find aptitudes for students. 

 Next, studying only one subject is dangerous. Usually, students will study in university for 4 years. If a student realizes that the subject doesn't suit for himself or herself, it would be miserable because time passed more than other students. So it will be safer to study many subjects because if one doesn't suit, students can try others.

 Finally, it is possible to converge two or more subjects to one. Integrating contents of subjects can make new ideas and conclusions. Studying many subjects deep as possible will help students to bring up fresh ideas. For example, Steve Jobs integrated Arts and Technology to make beautiful electronic devices and it successes a lot.

 In conclusion, universities should require students to take classes in many subjects. This will make university to help students to find their goals. Furthermore, it can provide possibilities of letting students integrate ideas of subjects."	3.0	3.0	3.0	9.0
638	Univeristy: Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer. ?  	"There are various tasks I have to do. Some of tasks are easy to do, and some of the tasks are not easy to do. In other words, there are the tasks that I could already do well, but there are also tacks that I am not used to do it. Usually, I can not chose the tasks I like. However, if I can chose the task I have to do, I prefer to do what I already do well.
 First reason why I prefer to do what I already do well is because I feel happy when I do the tasks. As everyone knows, our time is limited. Therefore, there is not enough time to do everything in our life. Hence, it is clever chose that we have to do what we can feel happy when we do it in our limited time. For me, I had to make decision between physics and mathematics that what subject I would study when I was in high schools. I wished I could study both, but 3 years high school is not enough time to master two subjects. Therefore, I choose math because I feel more happy when I study mathematics.
  Some people said, life would be too monotonic if we do only we already can do well, but that is not true. If we do steady something that we already are used to, then the new things always comes to us. For example, in mathematics, we learn calculus when we are freshmen, and almost every freshmen get used to the calculus, and they might feel boring in calculus. However, if we study the calculus more deeply and steady, we can recognized that there are new things about calculus such as PDE (partial differential equation) or CA (complex analysis). Therefore, study only about calculus never be monotonic. Every time we think its boring, new things always comes appear.
 To sum up, I prefer to do what I like to do and already do well because it makes me more happy, and it never get boring. As I mentioned, our life is so limited, there is no sufficient time to do something that is risky. I hope that everyone can find what they truly like to do and can do very well, and finally enjoy their happy life."	3.0	2.5	3.0	8.5
487	University: Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"All  Students Should Be Able To Access To Higher Education.

College and university education are higher education. This education is optional.  Some people claim that only qualified students should go to college; however, in my opinion, the chance of higher education should be provided to every student.  
First, one can make valuable relationships with the people met in college. In a college, students not only take the lecture but also participate in diverse activities such as attending parties, playing sports, or join concerts. Through these events, one can make friendships with peers, seniors, and juniors. This relationship would help one’s social life in the future. 
Second, students get a potential career and financial benefits. Some jobs require licenses which only can get through a college education or bachelor's degree. Also, many companies offer internships to only college students. Students provided a more diverse option when getting higher education such as entering graduate schools
It may be true that for some students, high tuition would be a burden. However, the Korean system of scholarship support is systematic and effective. Students can get enough support from the public scholarship foundation called ‘KOSAF’. Also, the private scholarship foundation offers tuition, too.  Many schools are making tuition-free for students from poor families. 
To sum up, higher education is beneficial for future careers and making relationships. So higher education should be provided to every student."	4.0	4.0	4.0	12.0
